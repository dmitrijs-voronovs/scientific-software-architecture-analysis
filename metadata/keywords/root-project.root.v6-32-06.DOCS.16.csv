Abstract; ========. This document describes the LLVM bitstream file format and the encoding of the; LLVM IR into it. Overview; ========. What is commonly known as the LLVM bitcode file format (also, sometimes; anachronistically known as bytecode) is actually two things: a `bitstream; container format`_ and an `encoding of LLVM IR`_ into the container format. The bitstream format is an abstract encoding of structured data, very similar to; XML in some ways. Like XML, bitstream files contain tags, and nested; structures, and you can parse the file without having to understand the tags.; Unlike XML, the bitstream format is a binary encoding, and unlike XML it; provides a mechanism for the file to self-describe ""abbreviations"", which are; effectively size optimizations for the content. LLVM IR files may be optionally embedded into a `wrapper`_ structure, or in a; `native object file`_. Both of these mechanisms make it easy to embed extra; data along with LLVM IR files. This document first describes the LLVM bitstream format, describes the wrapper; format, then describes the record structure used by LLVM IR files. .. _bitstream container format:. Bitstream Format; ================. The bitstream format is literally a stream of bits, with a very simple; structure. This structure consists of the following concepts:. * A ""`magic number`_"" that identifies the contents of the stream. * Encoding `primitives`_ like variable bit-rate integers. * `Blocks`_, which define nested content. * `Data Records`_, which describe entities within the file. * Abbreviations, which specify compression optimizations for the file. Note that the :doc:`llvm-bcanalyzer <CommandGuide/llvm-bcanalyzer>` tool can be; used to dump and inspect arbitrary bitstreams, which is very useful for; understanding the encoding. .. _magic number:.

Magic Numbers; -------------. The first four bytes of a bitstream are used as an application-specific magic; number. Generic bitcode tools may look at the first four bytes to determine; whether the stream is a known stream type. However, these tools should *not*; determine whether a bitstream is valid based on its magic number alone. New; application-specific bitstream formats are being developed all the time; tools; should not reject them just because they have a hitherto unseen magic number. .. _primitives:.

Primitives; ----------. A bitstream literally consists of a stream of bits, which are read in order; starting with the least significant bit of each byte. The stream is made up of; a number of primitive values that encode a stream of unsigned integer values.; These integers are encoded in two ways: either as `Fixed Width Integers`_ or as; `Variable Width Integers`_. .. _Fixed Width Integers:; .. _fixed-width value:. Fixed Width Integers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Fixed-width integer values have their low bits emitted directly to the file.; For example, a 3-bit integer value encodes 1 as 001. Fixed width integers are; used when there are a well-known number of options for a field. For example,; boolean values are usually encoded with a 1-bit wide integer. .. _Variable Width Integers:; .. _Variable Width Integer:; .. _variable-width value:. Variable Width Integers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Variable-width integer (VBR) values encode values of arbitrary size, optimizing; for the case where the values are small. Given a 4-bit VBR field, any 3-bit; value (0 through 7) is encoded directly, with the high bit set to zero. Values; larger than N-1 bits emit their bits in a series of N-1 bit chunks, where all; but the last set the high bit. For example, the value 30 (0x1E) is encoded as 62 (0b0011'1110) when emitted as; a vbr4 value. The first set of four bits starting from the least significant; indicates the value 6 (110) with a continuation piece (indicated by a high bit; of 1). The next set of four bits indicates a value of 24 (011 << 3) with no; continuation. The sum (6+24) yields the value 30. .. _char6-encoded value:. 6-bit characters; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. 6-bit characters encode common characters into a fixed 6-bit field. They; represent the following characters with the following 6-bit values:. ::. 'a' .. 'z' --- 0 .. 25; 'A' .. 'Z' --- 26 .. 51; '0' .. '9' --- 52 .. 61; '.' --- 62; '_' --- 63.

Versions 0, 1 and 2 are supported at this time. The difference between; version 0 and 1 is in the encoding of instruction operands in; each `FUNCTION_BLOCK`_. In version 0, each value defined by an instruction is assigned an ID; unique to the function. Function-level value IDs are assigned starting from; ``NumModuleValues`` since they share the same namespace as module-level; values. The value enumerator resets after each function. When a value is; an operand of an instruction, the value ID is used to represent the operand.; For large functions or large modules, these operand values can be large. The encoding in version 1 attempts to avoid large operand values; in common cases. Instead of using the value ID directly, operands are; encoded as relative to the current instruction. Thus, if an operand; is the value defined by the previous instruction, the operand; will be encoded as 1.

It is not safe to skip them. .. _wrapper:. Bitcode Wrapper Format; ======================. Bitcode files for LLVM IR may optionally be wrapped in a simple wrapper; structure. This structure contains a simple header that indicates the offset; and size of the embedded BC file. This allows additional information to be; stored alongside the BC file. The structure of this file header is:. :raw-html:`<tt><blockquote>`; [Magic\ :sub:`32`, Version\ :sub:`32`, Offset\ :sub:`32`, Size\ :sub:`32`, CPUType\ :sub:`32`]; :raw-html:`</blockquote></tt>`. Each of the fields are 32-bit fields stored in little endian form (as with the; rest of the bitcode file fields). The Magic number is always ``0x0B17C0DE`` and; the version is currently always ``0``. The Offset field is the offset in bytes; to the start of the bitcode stream in the file, and the Size field is the size; in bytes of the stream. CPUType is a target-specific value that can be used to; encode the CPU of the target. .. _native object file:.

The bitstream format is an abstract encoding of structured data, very similar to; XML in some ways. Like XML, bitstream files contain tags, and nested; structures, and you can parse the file without having to understand the tags.; Unlike XML, the bitstream format is a binary encoding, and unlike XML it; provides a mechanism for the file to self-describe ""abbreviations"", which are; effectively size optimizations for the content. LLVM IR files may be optionally embedded into a `wrapper`_ structure, or in a; `native object file`_. Both of these mechanisms make it easy to embed extra; data along with LLVM IR files. This document first describes the LLVM bitstream format, describes the wrapper; format, then describes the record structure used by LLVM IR files. .. _bitstream container format:. Bitstream Format; ================. The bitstream format is literally a stream of bits, with a very simple; structure. This structure consists of the following concepts:. * A ""`magic number`_"" that identifies the contents of the stream. * Encoding `primitives`_ like variable bit-rate integers. * `Blocks`_, which define nested content. * `Data Records`_, which describe entities within the file. * Abbreviations, which specify compression optimizations for the file. Note that the :doc:`llvm-bcanalyzer <CommandGuide/llvm-bcanalyzer>` tool can be; used to dump and inspect arbitrary bitstreams, which is very useful for; understanding the encoding. .. _magic number:. Magic Numbers; -------------. The first four bytes of a bitstream are used as an application-specific magic; number.

For each DAG, the entry node is assigned a mass of ``UINT64_MAX`` and mass is; distributed to successors according to branch weights. Block Mass uses a; fixed-point representation where ``UINT64_MAX`` represents ``1.0`` and ``0``; represents a number just above ``0.0``.

At this point, if the amount of transformations is still too large, then; inserting code to limit whether or not to execute the body of the code in the; visit function can be helpful. Add a static counter which is incremented on; every invocation of the function. Then add code which simply returns false on; desired ranges.

Next, ``bugpoint`` tries removing functions from the test program, to reduce its; size. Usually it is able to reduce a test program to a single function, when; debugging intraprocedural optimizations. Once the number of functions has been; reduced, it attempts to delete various edges in the control flow graph, to; reduce the size of the function as much as possible. Finally, ``bugpoint``; deletes any individual LLVM instructions whose absence does not eliminate the; failure.

Advice for using bugpoint; =========================. ``bugpoint`` can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in; non-obvious ways. Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation.

In particular, InstCombine and; TargetLowering both have visitor structured code with lots of potential; transformations. If the process of using bugpoint has left you with still too; much code to figure out and the problem seems to be in instcombine, the; following steps may help. These same techniques are useful with TargetLowering; as well. Turn on ``-debug-only=instcombine`` and see which transformations within; instcombine are firing by selecting out lines with ""``IC``"" in them. At this point, you have a decision to make. Is the number of transformations; small enough to step through them using a debugger? If so, then try that. If there are too many transformations, then a source modification approach may; be helpful. In this approach, you can modify the source code of instcombine to; disable just those transformations that are being performed on your test input; and perform a binary search over the set of transformations. One set of places; to modify are the ""``visit*``"" methods of ``InstCombiner`` (*e.g.*; ``visitICmpInst``) by adding a ""``return false``"" as the first line of the; method.

Description; ===========. ``bugpoint`` narrows down the source of problems in LLVM tools and passes. It; can be used to debug three types of failures: optimizer crashes, miscompilations; by optimizers, or bad native code generation (including problems in the static; and JIT compilers). It aims to reduce large test cases to small, useful ones.; For example, if ``opt`` crashes while optimizing a file, it will identify the; optimization (or combination of optimizations) that causes the crash, and reduce; the file down to a small example which triggers the crash. For detailed case scenarios, such as debugging ``opt``, or one of the LLVM code; generators, see :doc:`HowToSubmitABug`. Design Philosophy; =================. ``bugpoint`` is designed to be a useful tool without requiring any hooks into; the LLVM infrastructure at all. It works with any and all LLVM passes and code; generators, and does not need to ""know"" how they work. Because of this, it may; appear to do stupid things or miss obvious simplifications. ``bugpoint`` is; also designed to trade off programmer time for computer time in the; compiler-debugging process; consequently, it may take a long period of; (unattended) time to reduce a test case, but we feel it is still worth it. Note; that ``bugpoint`` is generally very quick unless debugging a miscompilation; where each test of the program (which requires executing it) takes a long time.

Set *LLVM_STRICT_DISTRIBUTIONS* to ``On`` if you want to; enforce a target appearing in only one distribution and umbrella distributions; being consistent with target distributions. We strongly encourage looking at ``clang/cmake/caches/MultiDistributionExample.cmake``; as an example of configuring multiple distributions. Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst

This; option should not be used if your distribution includes static archives, as the; objects inside the archive will be LLVM bitcode, which is not portable. The :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` documentation describes the built-in tooling for; generating LLVM profiling information to drive Profile-Guided-Optimization. The; in-tree profiling tests are very limited, and generating the profile takes a; significant amount of time, but it can result in a significant improvement in; the performance of the generated binaries. In addition to PGO profiling we also have limited support in-tree for generating; linker order files. These files provide the linker with a suggested ordering for; functions in the final binary layout. This can measurably speed up clang by; physically grouping functions that are called temporally close to each other.; The current tooling is only available on Darwin systems with ``dtrace(1)``. It; is worth noting that dtrace is non-deterministic, and so the order file; generation using dtrace is also non-deterministic. Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst

Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*.

Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``.

Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never be built using the *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake; option. (:ref:`See the warning above for more explanation <shared_libs>`.). Relevant CMake Options; ======================. This section provides documentation of the CMake options that are intended to; help construct distributions. This is not an exhaustive list, and many; additional options are documented in the :doc:`CMake` page.

Basic CMake usage; =================. This section explains basic aspects of CMake; which you may need in your day-to-day usage. CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as; online help accessible via the ``cmake`` executable itself. Execute ``cmake; --help`` for further help options. CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio,; or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which; build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your; build tool, CMake uses the corresponding *Generator* to create files for your; build tool (e.g., Makefiles or Visual Studio or Xcode project files). You can; explicitly specify the generator with the command line option ``-G ""Name of the; generator""``. To see a list of the available generators on your system, execute. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake --help. This will list the generator names at the end of the help text. Generators' names are case-sensitive, and may contain spaces. For this reason,; you should enter them exactly as they are listed in the ``cmake --help``; output, in quotes. For example, to generate project files specifically for; Visual Studio 12, you can execute:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12"" path/to/llvm/source/root. For a given development platform there can be more than one adequate; generator. If you use Visual Studio, ""NMake Makefiles"" is a generator you can use; for building with NMake. By default, CMake chooses the most specific generator; supported by your development environment. If you want an alternative generator,; you must tell this to CMake with the ``-G`` option. .. todo::.

The full; description is in `LLVM-related variables`_ below. **LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS**:STRING; Control which projects are enabled. For example you may want to work on clang; or lldb by specifying ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=""clang;lldb""``. **LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES**:STRING; Control which runtimes are enabled. For example you may want to work on; libc++ or libc++abi by specifying ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=""libcxx;libcxxabi""``. **LLVM_LIBDIR_SUFFIX**:STRING; Extra suffix to append to the directory where libraries are to be; installed. On a 64-bit architecture, one could use ``-DLLVM_LIBDIR_SUFFIX=64``; to install libraries to ``/usr/lib64``. **LLVM_PARALLEL_{COMPILE,LINK}_JOBS**:STRING; Building the llvm toolchain can use a lot of resources, particularly; linking. These options, when you use the Ninja generator, allow you; to restrict the parallelism. For example, to avoid OOMs or going; into swap, permit only one link job per 15GB of RAM available on a; 32GB machine, specify ``-G Ninja -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=2``. **LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD**:STRING; Control which targets are enabled. For example you may only need to enable; your native target with, for example, ``-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86``. .. _llvm_use_linker:. **LLVM_USE_LINKER**:STRING; Override the system's default linker. For instance use ``lld`` with; ``-DLLVM_USE_LINKER=lld``. Rarely-used CMake variables; ---------------------------. Here are some of the CMake variables that are rarely used, along with a brief; explanation and LLVM-related notes. For full documentation, consult the CMake; manual, or execute ``cmake --help-variable VARIABLE_NAME``. **CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD**:STRING; Sets the C++ standard to conform to when building LLVM.

If you are a CMake novice, start with `Basic CMake usage`_; and then go back to the `Quick start`_ section once you know what you are doing. The; `Options and variables`_ section is a reference for customizing your build. If; you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.

CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of tests, and; generate the files required for building LLVM. CMake will use default values; for all build parameters. See the `Options and variables`_ section for; a list of build parameters that you can modify.

Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>. CMake cache scripts are processed in an isolated scope, only cached variables; remain set when the main configuration runs. CMake cached variables do not reset; variables that are already set unless the FORCE option is specified. A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C.

Execute this command in the shell replacing `path/to/llvm/source/root` with; the path to the root of your LLVM source tree:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake path/to/llvm/source/root. CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of tests, and; generate the files required for building LLVM. CMake will use default values; for all build parameters. See the `Options and variables`_ section for; a list of build parameters that you can modify. This can fail if CMake can't detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the; environment is not sane enough. In this case, make sure that the toolset that; you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell, and that the shell; itself is the correct one for your development environment. CMake will refuse; to build MinGW makefiles if you have a POSIX shell reachable through the PATH; environment variable, for instance. You can force CMake to use a given build; tool; for instructions, see the `Usage`_ section, below.

Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>. CMake cache scripts are processed in an isolated scope, only cached variables; remain set when the main configuration runs. CMake cached variables do not reset; variables that are already set unless the FORCE option is specified. A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C.

The ``--build`` option tells ``cmake`` to invoke the underlying build; tool (``make``, ``ninja``, ``xcodebuild``, ``msbuild``, etc.). The underlying build tool can be invoked directly, of course, but; the ``--build`` option is portable. #. After LLVM has finished building, install it from the build directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake --build . --target install. The ``--target`` option with ``install`` parameter in addition to; the ``--build`` option tells ``cmake`` to build the ``install`` target. It is possible to set a different install prefix at installation time; by invoking the ``cmake_install.cmake`` script generated in the; build directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/llvm -P cmake_install.cmake. .. _Basic CMake usage:; .. _Usage:. Basic CMake usage; =================. This section explains basic aspects of CMake; which you may need in your day-to-day usage. CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as; online help accessible via the ``cmake`` executable itself. Execute ``cmake; --help`` for further help options. CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio,; or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which; build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your; build tool, CMake uses the corresponding *Generator* to create files for your; build tool (e.g., Makefiles or Visual Studio or Xcode project files). You can; explicitly specify the generator with the command line option ``-G ""Name of the; generator""``. To see a list of the available generators on your system, execute. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake --help. This will list the generator names at the end of the help text. Generators' names are case-sensitive, and may contain spaces. For this reason,; you should enter them exactly as they are listed in the ``cmake --help``; output, in quotes.

Defaults to OFF. **LLVM_ENABLE_IDE**:BOOL; Tell the build system that an IDE is being used. This in turn disables the; creation of certain convenience build system targets, such as the various; ``install-*`` and ``check-*`` targets, since IDEs don't always deal well with; a large number of targets. This is usually autodetected, but it can be; configured manually to explicitly control the generation of those targets. **LLVM_ENABLE_LIBCXX**:BOOL; If the host compiler and linker supports the stdlib flag, -stdlib=libc++ is; passed to invocations of both so that the project is built using libc++; instead of stdlibc++.

If you're looking for; information about modifying the LLVM CMake build system you may want to see the; :doc:`CMakePrimer` page. It has a basic overview of the CMake language. .. _Quick start:. Quick start; ===========. We use here the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. #. `Download <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_ and install; CMake. Version 3.20.0 is the minimum required. #. Open a shell. Your development tools must be reachable from this shell; through the PATH environment variable. #. Create a build directory. Building LLVM in the source; directory is not supported. cd to this directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir mybuilddir; $ cd mybuilddir. #. Execute this command in the shell replacing `path/to/llvm/source/root` with; the path to the root of your LLVM source tree:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake path/to/llvm/source/root. CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of tests, and; generate the files required for building LLVM. CMake will use default values; for all build parameters. See the `Options and variables`_ section for; a list of build parameters that you can modify. This can fail if CMake can't detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the; environment is not sane enough. In this case, make sure that the toolset that; you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell, and that the shell; itself is the correct one for your development environment. CMake will refuse; to build MinGW makefiles if you have a POSIX shell reachable through the PATH; environment variable, for instance. You can force CMake to use a given build; tool; for instructions, see the `Usage`_ section, below.

Here is a simple example of a CMakeLists.txt file that imports the LLVM libraries; and uses them to build a simple application ``simple-tool``. .. code-block:: cmake. cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0); project(SimpleProject). find_package(LLVM REQUIRED CONFIG). message(STATUS ""Found LLVM ${LLVM_PACKAGE_VERSION}""); message(STATUS ""Using LLVMConfig.cmake in: ${LLVM_DIR}""). # Set your project compile flags.; # E.g. if using the C++ header files; # you will need to enable C++11 support; # for your compiler. include_directories(${LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS}); separate_arguments(LLVM_DEFINITIONS_LIST NATIVE_COMMAND ${LLVM_DEFINITIONS}); add_definitions(${LLVM_DEFINITIONS_LIST}). # Now build our tools; add_executable(simple-tool tool.cpp). # Find the libraries that correspond to the LLVM components; # that we wish to use; llvm_map_components_to_libnames(llvm_libs support core irreader). # Link against LLVM libraries; target_link_libraries(simple-tool ${llvm_libs}). The ``find_package(...)`` directive when used in CONFIG mode (as in the above; example) will look for the ``LLVMConfig.cmake`` file in various locations (see; cmake manual for details). It creates a ``LLVM_DIR`` cache entry to save the; directory where ``LLVMConfig.cmake`` is found or allows the user to specify the; directory (e.g. by passing ``-DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/cmake/llvm`` to; the ``cmake`` command or by setting it directly in ``ccmake`` or ``cmake-gui``).

When a command is; invoked with extra arguments (beyond the named ones) CMake will store the full; list of arguments (both named and unnamed) in a list named ``ARGV``, and the; sublist of unnamed arguments in ``ARGN``. Below is a trivial example of; providing a wrapper function for CMake's built in function ``add_dependencies``. .. code-block:: cmake. function(add_deps target); add_dependencies(${target} ${ARGN}); endfunction(). This example defines a new macro named ``add_deps`` which takes a required first; argument, and just calls another function passing through the first argument and; all trailing arguments. CMake provides a module ``CMakeParseArguments`` which provides an implementation; of advanced argument parsing. We use this all over LLVM, and it is recommended; for any function that has complex argument-based behaviors or optional; arguments.

Lists; -----. In CMake lists are semi-colon delimited strings, and it is strongly advised that; you avoid using semi-colons in lists; it doesn't go smoothly. A few examples of; defining lists:. .. code-block:: cmake. # Creates a list with members a, b, c, and d; set(my_list a b c d); set(my_list ""a;b;c;d""). # Creates a string ""a b c d""; set(my_string ""a b c d""). Lists of Lists; --------------. One of the more complicated patterns in CMake is lists of lists. Because a list; cannot contain an element with a semi-colon to construct a list of lists you; make a list of variable names that refer to other lists. For example:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(list_of_lists a b c); set(a 1 2 3); set(b 4 5 6); set(c 7 8 9). With this layout you can iterate through the list of lists printing each value; with the following code:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(list_name IN LISTS list_of_lists); foreach(value IN LISTS ${list_name}); message(${value}); endforeach(); endforeach(). You'll notice that the inner foreach loop's list is doubly dereferenced. This is; because the first dereference turns ``list_name`` into the name of the sub-list; (a, b, or c in the example), then the second dereference is to get the value of; the list. This pattern is used throughout CMake, the most common example is the compiler; flags options, which CMake refers to using the following variable expansions:; CMAKE_${LANGUAGE}_FLAGS and CMAKE_${LANGUAGE}_FLAGS_${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}. Other Types; -----------. Variables that are cached or specified on the command line can have types; associated with them. The variable's type is used by CMake's UI tool to display; the right input field. A variable's type generally doesn't impact evaluation,; however CMake does have special handling for some variables such as PATH.; You can read more about the special handling in `CMake's set documentation; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/co",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMakePrimer.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMakePrimer.rst

Those; modules are the fundamental pieces needed to build LLVM-based projects with; CMake. We also rely on modules as a way of organizing the build system's; functionality for maintainability and re-use within LLVM projects. Argument Handling; -----------------. When defining a CMake command handling arguments is very useful. The examples; in this section will all use the CMake ``function`` block, but this all applies; to the ``macro`` block as well. CMake commands can have named arguments that are required at every call site. In; addition, all commands will implicitly accept a variable number of extra; arguments (In C parlance, all commands are varargs functions). When a command is; invoked with extra arguments (beyond the named ones) CMake will store the full; list of arguments (both named and unnamed) in a list named ``ARGV``, and the; sublist of unnamed arguments in ``ARGN``. Below is a trivial example of; providing a wrapper function for CMake's built in function ``add_dependencies``. .. code-block:: cmake. function(add_deps target); add_dependencies(${target} ${ARGN}); endfunction(). This example defines a new macro named ``add_deps`` which takes a required first; argument, and just calls another function passing through the first argument and; all trailing arguments. CMake provides a module ``CMakeParseArguments`` which provides an implementation; of advanced argument parsing. We use this all over LLVM, and it is recommended; for any function that has complex argument-based behaviors or optional; arguments. CMake's official documentation for the module is in the; ``cmake-modules`` manpage, and is also available at the; `cmake-modules online documentation; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/module/CMakeParseArguments.html>`_. .. note::; As of CMake 3.5 the cmake_parse_arguments command has become a native command; and the CMakeParseArguments module is empty and only left around for; compatibility.

Functions Vs Macros; -------------------. Functions and Macros look very similar in how they are used, but there is one; fundamental difference between the two. Functions have their own scope, and; macros don't. This means variables set in macros will bleed out into the calling; scope. That makes macros suitable for defining very small bits of functionality; only. The other difference between CMake functions and macros is how arguments are; passed. Arguments to macros are not set as variables, instead dereferences to; the parameters are resolved across the macro before executing it. This can; result in some unexpected behavior if using unreferenced variables. For example:. .. code-block:: cmake. macro(print_list my_list); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(""${var}""); endforeach(); endmacro(). set(my_list a b c d); set(my_list_of_numbers 1 2 3 4); print_list(my_list_of_numbers); # prints:; # a; # b; # c; # d. Generally speaking this issue is uncommon because it requires using; non-dereferenced variables with names that overlap in the parent scope, but it; is important to be aware of because it can lead to subtle bugs. LLVM Project Wrappers; =====================. LLVM projects provide lots of wrappers around critical CMake built-in commands.; We use these wrappers to provide consistent behaviors across LLVM components; and to reduce code duplication. We generally (but not always) follow the convention that commands prefaced with; ``llvm_`` are intended to be used only as building blocks for other commands.; Wrapper commands that are intended for direct use are generally named following; with the project in the middle of the command name (i.e. ``add_llvm_executable``; is the wrapper for ``add_executable``).

Generally speaking this issue is uncommon because it requires using; non-dereferenced variables with names that overlap in the parent scope, but it; is important to be aware of because it can lead to subtle bugs. LLVM Project Wrappers; =====================. LLVM projects provide lots of wrappers around critical CMake built-in commands.; We use these wrappers to provide consistent behaviors across LLVM components; and to reduce code duplication. We generally (but not always) follow the convention that commands prefaced with; ``llvm_`` are intended to be used only as building blocks for other commands.; Wrapper commands that are intended for direct use are generally named following; with the project in the middle of the command name (i.e. ``add_llvm_executable``; is the wrapper for ``add_executable``). The LLVM ``add_*`` wrapper functions are; all defined in ``AddLLVM.cmake`` which is installed as part of the LLVM; distribution. It can be included and used by any LLVM sub-project that requires; LLVM. .. note::. Not all LLVM projects require LLVM for all use cases. For example compiler-rt; can be built without LLVM, and the compiler-rt sanitizer libraries are used; with GCC. Useful Built-in Commands; ========================.

CMake also supports ``while`` loops, although they are not widely used in LLVM. Modules, Functions and Macros; =============================. Modules; -------. Modules are CMake's vehicle for enabling code reuse. CMake modules are just; CMake script files. They can contain code to execute on include as well as; definitions for commands. In CMake macros and functions are universally referred to as commands, and they; are the primary method of defining code that can be called multiple times. In LLVM we have several CMake modules that are included as part of our; distribution for developers who don't build our project from source. Those; modules are the fundamental pieces needed to build LLVM-based projects with; CMake. We also rely on modules as a way of organizing the build system's; functionality for maintainability and re-use within LLVM projects. Argument Handling; -----------------. When defining a CMake command handling arguments is very useful. The examples; in this section will all use the CMake ``function`` block, but this all applies; to the ``macro`` block as well. CMake commands can have named arguments that are required at every call site. In; addition, all commands will implicitly accept a variable number of extra; arguments (In C parlance, all commands are varargs functions). When a command is; invoked with extra arguments (beyond the named ones) CMake will store the full; list of arguments (both named and unnamed) in a list named ``ARGV``, and the; sublist of unnamed arguments in ``ARGN``. Below is a trivial example of; providing a wrapper function for CMake's built in function ``add_dependencies``. .. code-block:: cmake. function(add_deps target); add_dependencies(${target} ${ARGN}); endfunction(). This example defines a new macro named ``add_deps`",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMakePrimer.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMakePrimer.rst

CMake's official documentation for the module is in the; ``cmake-modules`` manpage, and is also available at the; `cmake-modules online documentation; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/module/CMakeParseArguments.html>`_. .. note::; As of CMake 3.5 the cmake_parse_arguments command has become a native command; and the CMakeParseArguments module is empty and only left around for; compatibility. Functions Vs Macros; -------------------. Functions and Macros look very similar in how they are used, but there is one; fundamental difference between the two. Functions have their own scope, and; macros don't. This means variables set in macros will bleed out into the calling; scope. That makes macros suitable for defining very small bits of functionality; only. The other difference between CMake functions and macros is how arguments are; passed. Arguments to macros are not set as variables, instead dereferences to; the parameters are resolved across the macro before executing it. This can; result in some unexpected behavior if using unreferenced variables. For example:. .. code-block:: cmake. macro(print_list my_list); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(""${var}""); endforeach(); endmacro(). set(my_list a b c d); set(my_list_of_numbers 1 2 3 4); print_list(my_list_of_numbers); # prints:; # a; # b; # c; # d.

The CMake language provides control flow constructs in the form of foreach loops; and if blocks. To make the example above more complicated you could add an if; block to define ""APPLE"" when targeting Apple platforms:. .. code-block:: cmake. cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0); project(HelloWorld); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp); if(APPLE); target_compile_definitions(HelloWorld PUBLIC APPLE); endif(). Variables, Types, and Scope; ===========================. Dereferencing; -------------. In CMake variables are ""stringly"" typed. All variables are represented as; strings throughout evaluation. Wrapping a variable in ``${}`` dereferences it; and results in a literal substitution of the name for the value. CMake refers to; this as ""variable evaluation"" in their documentation. Dereferences are performed; *before* the command being called receives the arguments. This means; dereferencing a list results in multiple separate arguments being passed to the; command. Variable dereferences can be nested and be used to model complex data. For; example:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(var_name var1); set(${var_name} foo) # same as ""set(var1 foo)""; set(${${var_name}}_var bar) # same as ""set(foo_var bar)"". Dereferencing an unset variable results in an empty expansion. It is a common; pattern in CMake to conditionally set variables knowing that it will be used in; code paths that the variable isn't set. There are examples of this throughout; the LLVM CMake build system. An example of variable empty expansion is:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(APPLE); set(extra_sources Apple.cpp); endif(); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp ${extra_sources}). In this example the ``extra_sources`` variable is only defined if you're; targeting an Apple platform.

https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMakePrimer.rst:5731,Performance,cache,cached,5731," a list of lists you; make a list of variable names that refer to other lists. For example:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(list_of_lists a b c); set(a 1 2 3); set(b 4 5 6); set(c 7 8 9). With this layout you can iterate through the list of lists printing each value; with the following code:. .. code-block:: cmake. foreach(list_name IN LISTS list_of_lists); foreach(value IN LISTS ${list_name}); message(${value}); endforeach(); endforeach(). You'll notice that the inner foreach loop's list is doubly dereferenced. This is; because the first dereference turns ``list_name`` into the name of the sub-list; (a, b, or c in the example), then the second dereference is to get the value of; the list. This pattern is used throughout CMake, the most common example is the compiler; flags options, which CMake refers to using the following variable expansions:; CMAKE_${LANGUAGE}_FLAGS and CMAKE_${LANGUAGE}_FLAGS_${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}. Other Types; -----------. Variables that are cached or specified on the command line can have types; associated with them.

Thus, if you need a value to be live across basic; block boundaries, it *must* live in a virtual register. Call-clobbered registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some machine instructions, like calls, clobber a large number of physical; registers. Rather than adding ``<def,dead>`` operands for all of them, it is; possible to use an ``MO_RegisterMask`` operand instead. The register mask; operand holds a bit mask of preserved registers, and everything else is; considered to be clobbered by the instruction. Machine code in SSA form; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``MachineInstr``'s are initially selected in SSA-form, and are maintained in; SSA-form until register allocation happens. For the most part, this is; trivially simple since LLVM is already in SSA form; LLVM PHI nodes become; machine code PHI nodes, and virtual registers are only allowed to have a single; definition.

Thus, if you need a value to be live across basic; block boundaries, it *must* live in a virtual register. Call-clobbered registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some machine instructions, like calls, clobber a large number of physical; registers. Rather than adding ``<def,dead>`` operands for all of them, it is; possible to use an ``MO_RegisterMask`` operand instead. The register mask; operand holds a bit mask of preserved registers, and everything else is; considered to be clobbered by the instruction. Machine code in SSA form; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``MachineInstr``'s are initially selected in SSA-form, and are maintained in; SSA-form until register allocation happens. For the most part, this is; trivially simple since LLVM is already in SSA form; LLVM PHI nodes become; machine code PHI nodes, and virtual registers are only allowed to have a single; definition. After register allocation, machine code is no longer in SSA-form because there; are no virtual registers left in the code. .. _MachineBasicBlock:. The ``MachineBasicBlock`` class; -------------------------------. The ``MachineBasicBlock`` class contains a list of machine instructions; (:raw-html:`<tt>` `MachineInstr`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` instances). It roughly; corresponds to the LLVM code input to the instruction selector, but there can be; a one-to-many mapping (i.e. one LLVM basic block can map to multiple machine; basic blocks).

There are also a number; of important subsystems that interact at this layer, they are described later in; this manual. .. _MCStreamer:. The ``MCStreamer`` API; ----------------------. MCStreamer is best thought of as an assembler API. It is an abstract API which; is *implemented* in different ways (e.g. to output a .s file, output an ELF .o; file, etc) but whose API correspond directly to what you see in a .s file.; MCStreamer has one method per directive, such as EmitLabel, EmitSymbolAttribute,; switchSection, emitValue (for .byte, .word), etc, which directly correspond to; assembly level directives. It also has an EmitInstruction method, which is used; to output an MCInst to the streamer. This API is most important for two clients: the llvm-mc stand-alone assembler is; effectively a parser that parses a line, then invokes a method on MCStreamer. In; the code generator, the `Code Emission`_ phase of the code generator lowers; higher level LLVM IR and Machine* constructs down to the MC layer, emitting; directives through MCStreamer. On the implementation side of MCStreamer, there are two major implementations:; one for writing out a .s file (MCAsmStreamer), and one for writing out a .o; file (MCObjectStreamer). MCAsmStreamer is a straightforward implementation; that prints out a directive for each method (e.g. ``EmitValue -> .byte``), but; MCObjectStreamer implements a full assembler. For target specific directives, the MCStreamer has a MCTargetStreamer instance.; Each target that needs it defines a class that inherits from it and is a lot; like MCStreamer itself: It has one method per directive and two classes that; inherit from it, a target object streamer and a target asm streamer. The target; asm streamer just prints it (``emitFnStart -> .fnstart``), and the object; streamer implement the assembler logic for it. To make llvm use these classes, the target initialization must call; TargetRegistry::RegisterAsmStreamer a",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

This step uses traditional prepass; scheduling techniques. After all of these steps are complete, the SelectionDAG is destroyed and the; rest of the code generation passes are run. One of the most common ways to debug these steps is using ``-debug-only=isel``,; which prints out the DAG, along with other information like debug info,; after each of these steps. Alternatively, ``-debug-only=isel-dump`` shows only; the DAG dumps, but the results can be filtered by function names using; ``-filter-print-funcs=<function names>``. One great way to visualize what is going on here is to take advantage of a few; LLC command line options. The following options pop up a window displaying the; SelectionDAG at specific times (if you only get errors printed to the console; while using this, you probably `need to configure your; system <ProgrammersManual.html#viewing-graphs-while-debugging-code>`_ to add support for it). * ``-view-dag-combine1-dags`` displays the DAG after being built, before the; first optimization pass. * ``-view-legalize-dags`` displays the DAG before Legalization. * ``-view-dag-combine2-dags`` displays the DAG before the second optimization; pass. * ``-view-isel-dags`` displays the DAG before the Select phase. * ``-view-sched-dags`` displays the DAG before Scheduling. The ``-view-sunit-dags`` displays the Scheduler's dependency graph. This graph; is based on the final SelectionDAG, with nodes that must be scheduled together; bundled into a single scheduling-unit node, and with immediate operands and; other nodes that aren't relevant for scheduling omitted.

There are two main ways of converting values of unsupported scalar types to; values of supported types: converting small types to larger types (""promoting""),; and breaking up large integer types into smaller ones (""expanding""). For; example, a target might require that all f32 values are promoted to f64 and that; all i1/i8/i16 values are promoted to i32. The same target might require that; all i64 values be expanded into pairs of i32 values. These changes can insert; sign and zero extensions as needed to make sure that the final code has the same; behavior as the input. There are two main ways of converting values of unsupported vector types to; value of supported types: splitting vector types, multiple times if necessary,; until a legal type is found, and extending vector types by adding elements to; the end to round them out to legal types (""widening""). If a vector gets split; all the way down to single-element parts with no supported vector type being; found, the elements are converted to scalars (""scalarizing"").

If the last basic block of a; function is a ``return``, then it's marked as using all live out values in the; function. ``PHI`` nodes need to be handled specially, because the calculation of the live; variable information from a depth first traversal of the CFG of the function; won't guarantee that a virtual register used by the ``PHI`` node is defined; before it's used. When a ``PHI`` node is encountered, only the definition is; handled, because the uses will be handled in other basic blocks.

Moreover, the class ``MCRegAliasIterator`` enumerates all the physical; registers aliased to a register. Physical registers, in LLVM, are grouped in *Register Classes*. Elements in the; same register class are functionally equivalent, and can be interchangeably; used. Each virtual register can only be mapped to physical registers of a; particular class. For instance, in the X86 architecture, some virtuals can only; be allocated to 8 bit registers. A register class is described by; ``TargetRegisterClass`` objects. To discover if a virtual register is; compatible with a given physical, this code can be used:. .. code-block:: c++. bool RegMapping_Fer::compatible_class(MachineFunction &mf,; unsigned v_reg,; unsigned p_reg) {; assert(TargetRegisterInfo::isPhysicalRegister(p_reg) &&; ""Target register must be physical"");; const TargetRegisterClass *trc = mf.getRegInfo().getRegClass(v_reg);; return trc->contains(p_reg);; }.

In a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture, the compiler is responsible; for mapping instructions to functional-units available on the architecture. To; that end, the compiler creates groups of instructions called *packets* or; *bundles*. The VLIW packetizer in LLVM is a target-independent mechanism to; enable the packetization of machine instructions. Mapping from instructions to functional units; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Instructions in a VLIW target can typically be mapped to multiple functional; units. During the process of packetizing, the compiler must be able to reason; about whether an instruction can be added to a packet. This decision can be; complex since the compiler has to examine all possible mappings of instructions; to functional units. Therefore to alleviate compilation-time complexity, the; VLIW packetizer parses the instruction classes of a target and generates tables; at compiler build time. These tables can then be queried by the provided; machine-independent API to determine if an instruction can be accommodat",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

See; ``llvm/CodeGen/DFAPacketizer.h`` for more information. Implementing a Native Assembler; ===============================. Though you're probably reading this because you want to write or maintain a; compiler backend, LLVM also fully supports building a native assembler.; We've tried hard to automate the generation of the assembler from the .td files; (in particular the instruction syntax and encodings), which means that a large; part of the manual and repetitive data entry can be factored and shared with the; compiler. Instruction Parsing; -------------------. .. note::. To Be Written. Instruction Alias Processing; ----------------------------. Once the instruction is parsed, it enters the MatchInstructionImpl function.; The MatchInstructionImpl function performs alias processing and then does actual; matching. Alias processing is the phase that canonicalizes different lexical forms of the; same instructions down to one representation. There are several different kinds; of alias that are possible to implement and they are listed below in the order; that they are processed (which is in order from simplest/weakest to most; complex/powerful). Generally you want to use the first alias mechanism that; meets the needs of your instruction, because it will allow a more concise; description. Mnemonic Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first phase of alias processing is simple instruction mnemonic remapping for; classes of instructions which are allowed with two different mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for example X86 has:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""cbw"", ""cbtw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""smovq"", ""movsq"">;; def : Mnemo",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

This; currently causes each ``fastcc`` call that is not tail call optimized (because; one or more of above constraints are not met) to be followed by a readjustment; of the stack. So performance might be worse in such cases. Sibling call optimization; -------------------------. Sibling call optimization is a restricted form of tail call optimization.; Unlike tail call optimization described in the previous section, it can be; performed automatically on any tail calls when ``-tailcallopt`` option is not; specified. Sibling call optimization is currently performed on x86/x86-64 when the; following constraints are met:. * Caller and callee have the same calling convention. It can be either ``c`` or; ``fastcc``. * The call is a tail call - in tail position (ret immediately follows call and; ret uses value of call or is void). * Caller and callee have matching return type or the callee result is not used. * If any of the callee arguments are being passed in stack, they must be; available in caller's own incoming argument stack and the frame offsets must; be the same. Example:. .. code-block:: llvm. declare i32 @bar(i32, i32). define i32 @foo(i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c) {; entry:; %0 = tail call i32 @bar(i32 %a, i32 %b); ret i32 %0; }.

Thus, the; parameter area must be large enough to store all the parameters for the largest; call sequence made by the caller. The size must also be minimally large enough; to spill registers r3-r10. This allows callees blind to the call signature,; such as thunks and vararg functions, enough space to cache the argument; registers. Therefore, the parameter area is minimally 32 bytes (64 bytes in 64; bit mode.) Also note that since the parameter area is a fixed offset from the; top of the frame, that a callee can access its split arguments using fixed; offsets from the stack pointer (or base pointer.). Combining the information about the linkage, parameter areas and alignment. A; stack frame is minimally 64 bytes in 32 bit mode and 128 bytes in 64 bit mode. The *dynamic area* starts out as size zero. If a function uses dynamic alloca; then space is added to the stack, the linkage and parameter areas are shifted to; top of stack, and the new space is available immediately below the linkage and; parameter areas. The cost of shifting the linkage and parameter areas is minor; since only the link value needs to be copied. The link value can be easily; fetched by adding the original frame size to the base pointer. Note that; allocations in the dynamic space need to observe 16 byte alignment. The *locals area* is where the llvm compiler reserves space for local variables. The *saved registers area* is where the llvm compiler spills callee saved; registers on entry to the callee. Prolog/Epilog; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The llvm prolog and epilog are the same as described in the PowerPC ABI, with; the following exceptions. Callee saved registers are spilled after the frame is; created. This allows the llvm epilog/prolog support to be common with other; targets. The base pointer callee saved register r31 is saved in the TOC slot of; linkage area.

The two pieces of the LLVM code generator are the high-level interface to the; code generator and the set of reusable components that can be used to build; target-specific backends. The two most important interfaces (:raw-html:`<tt>`; `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` and :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>`) are the only ones that are required to be defined for a; backend to fit into the LLVM system, but the others must be defined if the; reusable code generator components are going to be used. This design has two important implications. The first is that LLVM can support; completely non-traditional code generation targets. For example, the C backend; does not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of the other; standard components provided by the system. As such, it only implements these; two interfaces, and does its own thing. Note that C backend was removed from the; trunk since LLVM 3.1 release. Another example of a code generator like this is a; (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM to the GCC RTL form and uses; GCC to emit machine code for a target. This design also implies that it is possible to design and implement radically; different code generators in the LLVM system that do not make use of any of the; built-in components. Doing so is not recommended at all, but could be required; for radically different targets that do not fit into the LLVM machine; description model: FPGAs for example. .. _high-level design of the code generator:. The high-level design of the code generator; -------------------------------------------. The LLVM target-independent code generator is designed to support efficient and; quality code generation for standard register-based microprocessors.

These target descriptions often have a large amount of common; information (e.g., an ``add`` instruction is almost identical to a ``sub``; instruction). In order to allow the maximum amount of commonality to be; factored out, the LLVM code generator uses the; :doc:`TableGen/index` tool to describe big chunks of the; target machine, which allows the use of domain-specific and target-specific; abstractions to reduce the amount of repetition. As LLVM continues to be developed and refined, we plan to move more and more of; the target description to the ``.td`` form. Doing so gives us a number of; advantages. The most important is that it makes it easier to port LLVM because; it reduces the amount of C++ code that has to be written, and the surface area; of the code generator that needs to be understood before someone can get; something working. Second, it makes it easier to change things. In particular,; if tables and other things are all emitted by ``tblgen``, we only need a change; in one place (``tblgen``) to update all of the targets to a new interface. .. _Abstract target description:; .. _target description:. Target description classes; ==========================. The LLVM target description classes (located in the ``include/llvm/Target``; directory) provide an abstract description of the target machine independent of; any particular client. These classes are designed to capture the *abstract*; properties of the target (such as the instructions and registers it has), and do; not incorporate any particular pieces of code generation algorithms. All of the target description classes (except the :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>` class) are designed to be subclassed by the concrete target; implementation, and have virtual methods implemented. To get to these; implementations, the :raw-html:`<tt>` `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class; provides accessors that should be implemented by the target. .. _TargetMachine:.

LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use); the FS/GS-segment registers for various low-level purposes, so care should be; taken when considering them.

Live Intervals are the ranges (intervals) where a variable is *live*. They are; used by some `register allocator`_ passes to determine if two or more virtual; registers which require the same physical register are live at the same point in; the program (i.e., they conflict). When this situation occurs, one virtual; register must be *spilled*. Live Variable Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first step in determining the live intervals of variables is to calculate; the set of registers that are immediately dead after the instruction (i.e., the; instruction calculates the value, but it is never used) and the set of registers; that are used by the instruction, but are never used after the instruction; (i.e., they are killed). Live variable information is computed for; each *virtual* register and *register allocatable* physical register; in the function. This is done in a very efficient manner because it uses SSA to; sparsely compute lifetime information for virtual registers (which are in SSA; form) and only has to track physical registers within a block. Before register; allocation, LLVM can assume that physical registers are only live within a; single basic block. This allows it to do a single, local analysis to resolve; physical register lifetimes within each basic block. If a physical register is; not register allocatable (e.g., a stack pointer or condition codes), it is not; tracked. Physical registers may be live in to or out of a function. Live in values are; typically arguments in registers. Live out values are typically return values in; registers. Live in values are marked as such, and are given a dummy ""defining""; instruction during live intervals analysis. If the last basic block of a; function is a ``return``, then it's marked as using all live out values in the; function. ``PHI`` nodes need to be handled specially, because the calculation of the live; variable information from a depth first traversal of the CFG of the fu",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

For instance, by inspecting; ``lib/Target/X86/X86GenRegisterInfo.inc`` we see that the 32-bit register; ``EAX`` is denoted by 43, and the MMX register ``MM0`` is mapped to 65. Some architectures contain registers that share the same physical location. A; notable example is the X86 platform. For instance, in the X86 architecture, the; registers ``EAX``, ``AX`` and ``AL`` share the first eight bits. These physical; registers are marked as *aliased* in LLVM. Given a particular architecture, you; can check which registers are aliased by inspecting its ``RegisterInfo.td``; file. Moreover, the class ``MCRegAliasIterator`` enumerates all the physical; registers aliased to a register. Physical registers, in LLVM, are grouped in *Register Classes*. Elements in the; same register class are functionally equivalent, and can be interchangeably; used. Each virtual register can only be mapped to physical registers of a; particular class. For instance, in the X86 architecture, some virtuals can only; be allocated to 8 bit registers. A register class is described by; ``TargetRegisterClass`` objects. To discover if a virtual register is; compatible with a given physical, this code can be used:. .. code-block:: c++. bool RegMapping_Fer::compatible_class(MachineFunction &mf,; unsigned v_reg,; unsigned p_reg) {; assert(TargetRegisterInfo::isPhysicalRegister(p_reg) &&; ""Target register must be physical"");; const TargetRegisterClass *trc = mf.getRegInfo().getRegClass(v_reg);; return trc->contains(p_reg);; }. Sometimes, mostly for debugging purposes, it is useful to change the number of; physical registers available in the target architecture. This must be done; statically, inside the ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file. Just ``grep`` for; ``RegisterClass``, the last parameter of which is a list of registers. Just; commenting some out is one simple way to avoid them being used. A more polite; way is to explicitly exclude some registers from the *allocation order*.

Instruction folding; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. *Instruction folding* is an optimization performed during register allocation; that removes unnecessary copy instructions. For instance, a sequence of; instructions such as:. ::. %EBX = LOAD %mem_address; %EAX = COPY %EBX. can be safely substituted by the single instruction:. ::. %EAX = LOAD %mem_address. Instructions can be folded with the; ``TargetRegisterInfo::foldMemoryOperand(...)`` method. Care must be taken when; folding instructions; a folded instruction can be quite different from the; original instruction. See ``LiveIntervals::addIntervalsForSpills`` in; ``lib/CodeGen/LiveIntervalAnalysis.cpp`` for an example of its use. Built in register allocators; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The LLVM infrastructure provides the application developer with three different; register allocators:. * *Fast* --- This register allocator is the default for debug builds. It; allocates registers on a basic block level, attempting to keep values in; registers and reusing registers as appropriate. * *Basic* --- This is an incremental approach to register allocation. Live; ranges are assigned to registers one at a time in an order that is driven by; heuristics. Since code can be rewritten on-the-fly during allocation, this; framework allows interesting allocators to be developed as extensions. It is; not itself a production register allocator but is a potentially useful; stand-alone mode for triaging bugs and as a performance baseline. * *Greedy* --- *The default allocator*. This is a highly tuned implementation of; the *Basic* allocator that incorporates global live range splitting. This; allocator works hard to minimize the cost of spill code. * *PBQP* --- A Partitioned Boolean Quadratic Programming (PBQP) based register; allocator.

This translation layer is also responsible for expanding pseudo; ops used by the code generator into the actual machine instructions they; correspond to. The MCInsts that are generated by this are fed into the; instruction printer or the encoder. Finally, at your choosing, you can also implement a subclass of MCCodeEmitter; which lowers MCInst's into machine code bytes and relocations. This is; important if you want to support direct .o file emission, or would like to; implement an assembler for your target. Emitting function stack size information; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A section containing metadata on function stack sizes will be emitted when; ``TargetLoweringObjectFile::StackSizesSection`` is not null, and; ``TargetOptions::EmitStackSizeSection`` is set (-stack-size-section). The; section will contain an array of pairs of function symbol values (pointer size); and stack sizes (unsigned LEB128). The stack size values only include the space; allocated in the function prologue. Functions with dynamic stack allocations are; not included. VLIW Packetizer; ---------------. In a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture, the compiler is responsible; for mapping instructions to functional-units available on the architecture. To; that end, the compiler creates groups of instructions called *packets* or; *bundles*. The VLIW packetizer in LLVM is a target-independent mechanism to; enable the packetization of machine instructions. Mapping from instructions to functional units; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Instructions in a VLIW target can typically be mapped to multiple functional; units. During the process of packetizing, the compiler must be able to reason; about whether an instruction can be added to a packet. This decision can be; complex since the compiler has to examine all possible mappings of instructions; to functional units.

This decision can be; complex since the compiler has to examine all possible mappings of instructions; to functional units. Therefore to alleviate compilation-time complexity, the; VLIW packetizer parses the instruction classes of a target and generates tables; at compiler build time. These tables can then be queried by the provided; machine-independent API to determine if an instruction can be accommodated in a; packet. How the packetization tables are generated and used; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The packetizer reads instruction classes from a target's itineraries and creates; a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to represent the state of a packet. A DFA; consists of three major elements: inputs, states, and transitions. The set of; inputs for the generated DFA represents the instruction being added to a; packet. The states represent the possible consumption of functional units by; instructions in a packet. In the DFA, transitions from one state to another; occur on the addition of an instruction to an existing packet. If there is a; legal mapping of functional units to instructions, then the DFA contains a; corresponding transition. The absence of a transition indicates that a legal; mapping does not exist and that the instruction cannot be added to the packet. To generate tables for a VLIW target, add *Target*\ GenDFAPacketizer.inc as a; target to the Makefile in the target directory. The exported API provides three; functions: ``DFAPacketizer::clearResources()``,; ``DFAPacketizer::reserveResources(MachineInstr *MI)``, and; ``DFAPacketizer::canReserveResources(MachineInstr *MI)``. These functions allow; a target packetizer to add an instruction to an existing packet and to check; whether an instruction can be added to a packet. See; ``llvm/CodeGen/DFAPacketizer.h`` for more information.

Once the instruction is parsed, it enters the MatchInstructionImpl function.; The MatchInstructionImpl function performs alias processing and then does actual; matching. Alias processing is the phase that canonicalizes different lexical forms of the; same instructions down to one representation. There are several different kinds; of alias that are possible to implement and they are listed below in the order; that they are processed (which is in order from simplest/weakest to most; complex/powerful). Generally you want to use the first alias mechanism that; meets the needs of your instruction, because it will allow a more concise; description. Mnemonic Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first phase of alias processing is simple instruction mnemonic remapping for; classes of instructions which are allowed with two different mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for example X86 has:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""cbw"", ""cbtw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""smovq"", ""movsq"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fldcww"", ""fldcw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fucompi"", ""fucomip"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""ud2a"", ""ud2"">;. ... and many others. With a MnemonicAlias definition, th",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

Instruction Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The most general phase of alias processing occurs while matching is happening:; it provides new forms for the matcher to match along with a specific instruction; to generate. An instruction alias has two parts: the string to match and the; instruction to generate. For example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rr8W GR16:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rm8W GR16:$dst, i8mem:$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr8 GR32:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr16 GR32:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr8 GR64:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr16 GR64:$dst, GR16 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX64rr32 GR64:$dst, GR32 :$src)>;. This shows a powerful example of the instruction aliases, matching the same; mnemonic in multiple different ways depending on what operands are present in; the assembly. The result of instruction aliases can include operands in a; different order than the destination instruction, and can use an input multiple; times, for example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""clrb $reg"", (XOR8rr GR8 :$reg, GR8 :$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrw $reg"", (XOR16rr GR16:$reg, GR16:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrl $reg"", (XOR32rr GR32:$reg, GR32:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrq $reg"", (XOR64rr GR64:$reg, GR64:$reg)>;. This example also shows that tied operands are only listed once. In the X86; backend, XOR8rr has two input GR8's and one output GR8 (where an input is tied; to the output). InstAliases take a flattened operand list without duplicates; for tied operands. The result of an instruction alias can also use immediates; and fixed physical registers which are added as simple immediate operands in the; result, for example:. ::. // Fixed Immediate operand.; def : InstAlias<""aad"", (AAD8i8 10)>;. // Fixe",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

X86 address spaces supported; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. x86 has a feature which provides the ability to perform loads and stores to; different address spaces via the x86 segment registers.

Instruction naming; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An instruction name consists of the base name, a default operand size, and a; character per operand with an optional special size. For example:. ::.

Note: This link describes the 32 bit ABI. The 64 bit ABI is similar except; space for GPRs are 8 bytes wide (not 4) and r13 is reserved for system use. Frame Layout; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The size of a PowerPC frame is usually fixed for the duration of a function's; invocation. Since the frame is fixed size, all references into the frame can be; accessed via fixed offsets from the stack pointer. The exception to this is; when dynamic alloca or variable sized arrays are present, then a base pointer; (r31) is used as a proxy for the stack pointer and stack pointer is free to grow; or shrink. A base pointer is also used if llvm-gcc is not passed the; -fomit-frame-pointer flag. The stack pointer is always aligned to 16 bytes, so; that space allocated for altivec vectors will be properly aligned.

For example, the C backend; does not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of the other; standard components provided by the system. As such, it only implements these; two interfaces, and does its own thing. Note that C backend was removed from the; trunk since LLVM 3.1 release. Another example of a code generator like this is a; (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM to the GCC RTL form and uses; GCC to emit machine code for a target. This design also implies that it is possible to design and implement radically; different code generators in the LLVM system that do not make use of any of the; built-in components. Doing so is not recommended at all, but could be required; for radically different targets that do not fit into the LLVM machine; description model: FPGAs for example. .. _high-level design of the code generator:. The high-level design of the code generator; -------------------------------------------. The LLVM target-independent code generator is designed to support efficient and; quality code generation for standard register-based microprocessors. Code; generation in this model is divided into the following stages:. 1. `Instructio",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

These target descriptions often have a large amount of common; information (e.g., an ``add`` instruction is almost identical to a ``sub``; instruction). In order to allow the maximum amount of commonality to be; factored out, the LLVM code generator uses the; :doc:`TableGen/index` tool to describe big chunks of the; target machine, which allows the use of domain-specific and target-specific; abstractions to reduce the amount of repetition. As LLVM continues to be developed and refined, we plan to move more and more of; the target description to the ``.td`` form. Doing so gives us a number of; advantages. The most important is that it makes it easier to port LLVM because; it reduces the amount of C++ code that has to be written, and the surface area; of the code generator that needs to be understood before someone can get; something working. Second, it makes it easier to change things. In particular,; if tables and other things are all emitted by ``tblgen``, we only need a change; in one place (``tblgen``) to update all of the targets to a new interface. .. _Abstract target description:; .. _target description:. Target description classes; ==========================. The LLVM target description classes (located in the ``include/llvm/Target``; directory) provide an abstract description of the target machine independent of; any particular client. These classes are designed to capture the *abstract*; properties of the target (such as the instructions and registers it has), and do; not incorporate any particular pieces of code generation algorithms. All of the target description classes (except the :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>` class) are designed to be subclassed by the concrete target; implementation, and have virtual methods implemented. To get to these; implementations, the :raw-html:`<tt>` `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class; provides accessors that should be implemented by the target. .. _TargetMachine:. The ``TargetMachine",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

All of the target description classes (except the :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>` class) are designed to be subclassed by the concrete target; implementation, and have virtual methods implemented. To get to these; implementations, the :raw-html:`<tt>` `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class; provides accessors that should be implemented by the target. .. _TargetMachine:. The ``TargetMachine`` class; ---------------------------. The ``TargetMachine`` class provides virtual methods that are used to access the; target-specific implementations of the various target description classes via; the ``get*Info`` methods (``getInstrInfo``, ``getRegisterInfo``,; ``getFrameInfo``, etc.). This class is designed to be specialized by a concrete; target implementation (e.g., ``X86TargetMachine``) which implements the various; virtual methods. The only required target description class is the; :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class, but if the code; generator components are to be used, the other interfaces should be implemented; as well. .. _DataLayout:. The ``DataLayout`` class; ------------------------. The ``DataLayout`` class is the only required target description class, and it; is the only class that is not extensible (you cannot derive a new class from; it). ``DataLayout`` specifies information about how the target lays out memory; for structures, the alignment requirements for various data types, the size of; pointers in the target, and whether the target is little-endian or; big-endian. .. _TargetLowering:. The ``TargetLowering`` class; ----------------------------. The ``TargetLowering`` class is used by SelectionDAG based instruction selectors; primarily to describe how LLVM code should be lowered to SelectionDAG; operations. Among other things, this class indicates:. * an initial register class to use for various ``ValueType``\s,. * which operations are natively supported by the target machine,. * the",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

The ``TargetFrameLowering`` class is used to provide information about the stack; frame layout of the target. It holds the direction of stack growth, the known; stack alignment on entry to each function, and the offset to the local area.; The offset to the local area is the offset from the stack pointer on function; entry to the first location where function data (local variables, spill; locations) can be stored. The ``TargetSubtarget`` class; -----------------------------. The ``TargetSubtarget`` class is used to provide information about the specific; chip set being targeted. A sub-target informs code generation of which; instructions are supported, instruction latencies and instruction execution; itinerary; i.e., which processing units are used, in what order, and for how; long. The ``TargetJITInfo`` class; ---------------------------. The ``TargetJITInfo`` class exposes an abstract interface used by the; Just-In-Time code generator to perform target-specific activities, such as; emitting stubs. If a ``TargetMachine`` supports JIT code generation, it should; provide one of these objects through the ``getJITInfo`` method. .. _code being generated:; .. _machine code representation:.

This representation is completely target agnostic,; representing instructions in their most abstract form: an opcode and a series of; operands. This representation is designed to support both an SSA representation; for machine code, as well as a register allocated, non-SSA form. .. _MachineInstr:.

The ``MachineBasicBlock`` class has a ""``getBasicBlock``"" method,; which returns the LLVM basic block that it comes from. .. _MachineFunction:. The ``MachineFunction`` class; -----------------------------. The ``MachineFunction`` class contains a list of machine basic blocks; (:raw-html:`<tt>` `MachineBasicBlock`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` instances). It; corresponds one-to-one with the LLVM function input to the instruction selector.; In addition to a list of basic blocks, the ``MachineFunction`` contains a; ``MachineConstantPool``, a ``MachineFrameInfo``, a ``MachineFunctionInfo``, and; a ``MachineRegisterInfo``. See ``include/llvm/CodeGen/MachineFunction.h`` for; more information. ``MachineInstr Bundles``; ------------------------. LLVM code generator can model sequences of instructions as MachineInstr; bundles. A MI bundle can model a VLIW group / pack which contains an arbitrary; number of parallel instructions. It can also be used to model a sequential list; of instructions (potentially with data dependencies) that cannot be legally; separated (e.g. ARM Thumb2 IT blocks).

The various operation node types are described at the top of the; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h`` file.

Many other situations require multiple; values as well. Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges to; the node defining the used value. Because nodes may define multiple values,; edges are represented by instances of the ``SDValue`` class, which is a; ``<SDNode, unsigned>`` pair, indicating the node and result value being used,; respectively. Each value produced by an ``SDNode`` has an associated ``MVT``; (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is. SelectionDAGs contain two different kinds of values: those that represent data; flow and those that represent control flow dependencies. Data values are simple; edges with an integer or floating point value type. Control edges are; represented as ""chain"" edges which are of type ``MVT::Other``. These edges; provide an ordering between nodes that have side effects (such as loads, stores,; calls, returns, etc). All nodes that have side effects should take a token; chain as input and produce a new one as output. By convention, token chain; inputs are always operand #0, and chain results are always the last value; produced by an operation.

There are two main ways of converting values of unsupported scalar types to; values of supported types: converting small types to larger types (""promoting""),; and breaking up large integer types into smaller ones (""expanding""). For; example, a target might require that all f32 values are promoted to f64 and that; all i1/i8/i16 values are promoted to i32. The same target might require that; all i64 values be expanded into pairs of i32 values.

The SelectionDAG optimization phase is run multiple times for code generation,; immediately after the DAG is built and once after each legalization.

Subsequent runs of the pass clean up the messy code generated by the; Legalize passes, which allows Legalize to be very simple (it can focus on making; code legal instead of focusing on generating *good* and legal code).

The method ``MachineOperand::isDef()`` informs if that registers is; being defined. We will call physical registers present in the LLVM bitcode before register; allocation *pre-colored registers*. Pre-colored registers are used in many; different situations, for instance, to pass parameters of functions calls, and; to store results of particular instructions. There are two types of pre-colored; registers: the ones *implicitly* defined, and those *explicitly*; defined. Explicitly defined registers are normal operands, and can be accessed; with ``MachineInstr::getOperand(int)::getReg()``. In order to check which; registers are implicitly defined by an instruction, use the; ``TargetInstrInfo::get(opcode)::ImplicitDefs``, where ``opcode`` is the opcode; of the target instruction. One important difference between explicit and; implicit physical registers is that the latter are defined statically for each; instruction, whereas the former may vary depending on the program being; compiled. For example, an instruction that represents a function call will; always implicitly define or use the same set of physical registers.

The result of instruction aliases can include operands in a; different order than the destination instruction, and can use an input multiple; times, for example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""clrb $reg"", (XOR8rr GR8 :$reg, GR8 :$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrw $reg"", (XOR16rr GR16:$reg, GR16:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrl $reg"", (XOR32rr GR32:$reg, GR32:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrq $reg"", (XOR64rr GR64:$reg, GR64:$reg)>;.

The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use); the FS/GS-segment registers for various low-level purposes, so care should be; taken when considering them. Instruction naming; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An instruction name consists of the base name, a default operand size, and a; character per operand with an optional special size. For example:. ::. ADD8rr -> add, 8-bit register, 8-bit register; IMUL16rmi -> imul, 16-bit register, 16-bit memory, 16-bit immediate; IMUL16rmi8 -> imul, 16-bit register, 16-bit memory, 8-bit immediate; MOVSX32rm16 -> movsx, 32-bit register, 16-bit memory.

Function calls; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Function call arguments are passed using up to five registers (R1 - R5).; The return value is passed in a dedicated register (R0). Four additional; registers (R6 - R9) are callee-saved, and the values in these registers; are preserved within kernel functions. R0 - R5 are scratch registers within; kernel functions, and eBPF programs must therefor store/restore values in; these registers if needed across function calls. The stack can be accessed; using the read-only frame pointer R10. eBPF registers map 1:1 to hardware; registers on x86_64 and other 64-bit architectures. For example, x86_64; in-kernel JIT maps them as. ::. R0 - rax; R1 - rdi; R2 - rsi; R3 - rdx; R4 - rcx; R5 - r8; R6 - rbx; R7 - r13; R8 - r14; R9 - r15; R10 - rbp. since x86_64 ABI mandates rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9 for argument passing; and rbx, r12 - r15 are callee saved. Program start; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An eBPF program receives a single argument and contains; a single eBPF main routine; the program does not contain eBPF functions.; Function calls are limited to a predefined set of kernel functions. The size; of a program is limited to 4K instructions: this ensures fast termination and; a limited number of kernel function calls. Prior to running an eBPF program,; a verifier performs static analysis to prevent loops in the code and; to ensure valid register usage and operand types. The AMDGPU backend; ------------------.

The LLVM JIT is completely target; independent (it uses the ``TargetJITInfo`` structure to interface for; target-specific issues. The code for the target-independent JIT lives in; ``lib/ExecutionEngine/JIT``. Depending on which part of the code generator you are interested in working on,; different pieces of this will be useful to you.

The ``TargetInstrInfo`` class; -----------------------------. The ``TargetInstrInfo`` class is used to describe the machine instructions; supported by the target. Descriptions define things like the mnemonic for; the opcode, the number of operands, the list of implicit register uses and defs,; whether the instruction has certain target-independent properties (accesses; memory, is commutable, etc), and holds any target-specific flags. The ``TargetFrameLowering`` class; ---------------------------------. The ``TargetFrameLowering`` class is used to provide information about the stack; frame layout of the target. It holds the direction of stack growth, the known; stack alignment on entry to each function, and the offset to the local area.; The offset to the local area is the offset from the stack pointer on function; entry to the first location where function data (local variables, spill; locations) can be stored. The ``TargetSubtarget`` class; -----------------------------. The ``TargetSubtarget`` class is used to provide information about the specific; chip set being targeted. A sub-target informs code generation of which; instructions are supported, instruction latencies and instruction execution; itinerary; i.e., which processing units are used, in what order, and for how; long. The ``TargetJITInfo`` class; ---------------------------. The ``TargetJITInfo`` class exposes an abstract interface used by the; Just-In-Time code generator to perform target-specific activities, such as; emitting stubs.

One important issue that the code generator needs to be aware of is the presence; of fixed registers. In particular, there are often places in the instruction; stream where the register allocator *must* arrange for a particular value to be; in a particular register. This can occur due to limitations of the instruction; set (e.g., the X86 can only do a 32-bit divide with the ``EAX``/``EDX``; registers), or external factors like calling conventions. In any case, the; instruction selector should emit code that copies a virtual register into or out; of a physical register when needed. For example, consider this simple LLVM example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32 %X, i32 %Y) {; %Z = sdiv i32 %X, %Y; ret i32 %Z; }. The X86 instruction selector might produce this machine code for the ``div`` and; ``ret``:. .. code-block:: text. ;; Start of div; %EAX = mov %reg1024 ;; Copy X (in reg1024) into EAX; %reg1027 = sar %reg1024, 31; %EDX = mov %reg1027 ;; Sign extend X into EDX; idiv %reg1025 ;; Divide by Y (in reg1025); %reg1026 = mov %EAX ;; Read the result (Z) out of EAX. ;; Start of ret; %EAX = mov %reg1026 ;; 32-bit return value goes in EAX; ret. By the end of code generation, the register allocator would coalesce the; registers and delete the resultant identity moves producing the following; code:. .. code-block:: text. ;; X is in EAX, Y is in ECX; mov %EAX, %EDX; sar %EDX, 31; idiv %ECX; ret. This approach is extremely general (if it can handle the X86 architecture, it; can handle anything!) and allows all of the target specific knowledge about the; instruction stream to be isolated in the instruction selector. Note that; physical registers should have a short lifetime for good code generation, and; all physical registers are assumed dead on entry to and exit from basic blocks; (before register allocation). Thus, if you need a value to be live across basic; block boundaries, it *must* live in a virtual register.

More; specifically, the pass which determines what MIs should be bundled; together should be done after code generator exits SSA form; (i.e. after two-address pass, PHI elimination, and copy coalescing).; Such bundles should be finalized (i.e. adding BUNDLE MIs and input and; output register MachineOperands) after virtual registers have been; rewritten into physical registers. This eliminates the need to add; virtual register operands to BUNDLE instructions which would; effectively double the virtual register def and use lists. Bundles may; use virtual registers and be formed in SSA form, but may not be; appropriate for all use cases. .. _MC Layer:. The ""MC"" Layer; ==============. The MC Layer is used to represent and process code at the raw machine code; level, devoid of ""high level"" information like ""constant pools"", ""jump tables"",; ""global variables"" or anything like that. At this level, LLVM handles things; like label names, machine instructions, and sections in the object file. The; code in this layer is used for a number of important purposes: the tail end of; the code generator uses it to write a .s or .o file, and it is also used by the; llvm-mc tool to implement standalone machine code assemblers and disassemblers. This section describes some of the important classes. There are also a number; of important subsystems that interact at this layer, they are described later in; this manual. .. _MCStreamer:. The ``MCStreamer`` API; ----------------------. MCStreamer is best thought of as an assembler API. It is an abstract API which; is *implemented* in different ways (e.g. to output a .s file, output an ELF .o; file, etc) but whose API correspond directly to what you see in a .s file.; MCStreamer has one method per directive, such as EmitLabel, EmitSymbol",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

SelectionDAG LegalizeTypes Phase; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The Legalize phase is in charge of converting a DAG to only use the types that; are natively supported by the target. There are two main ways of converting values of unsupported scalar types to; values of supported types: converting small types to larger types (""promoting""),; and breaking up large integer types into smaller ones (""expanding""). For; example, a target might require that all f32 values are promoted to f64 and that; all i1/i8/i16 values are promoted to i32. The same target might require that; all i64 values be expanded into pairs of i32 values. These changes can insert; sign and zero extensions as needed to make sure that the final code has the same; behavior as the input. There are two main ways of converting values of unsupported vector types to; value of supported types: splitting vector types, multiple times if necessary,; until a legal type is found, and extending vector types by adding elements to; the end to round them out to legal types (""widening"").

Late Machine Code Optimizations; -------------------------------. .. note::. To Be Written. .. _Code Emission:. Code Emission; -------------. The code emission step of code generation is responsible for lowering from the; code generator abstractions (like `MachineFunction`_, `MachineInstr`_, etc) down; to the abstractions used by the MC layer (`MCInst`_, `MCStreamer`_, etc). This; is done with a combination of several different classes: the (misnamed); target-independent AsmPrinter class, target-specific subclasses of AsmPrinter; (such as SparcAsmPrinter), and the TargetLoweringObjectFile class. Since the MC layer works at the level of abstraction of object files, it doesn't; have a notion of functions, global variables etc. Instead, it thinks about; labels, directives, and instructions. A key class used at this time is the; MCStreamer class. This is an abstract API that is implemented in different ways; (e.g. to output a .s file, output an ELF .o file, etc) that is effectively an; ""assembler API"". MCStreamer has one method per directive, such as EmitLabel,; EmitSymbolAttribute, switchSection, etc, which directly correspond to assembly; level directives. If you are interested in implementing a code generator for a target, there are; three important things that you have to implement for your target:. #. First, you need a subclass of AsmPrinter for your target. This class; implements the general lowering process converting MachineFunction's into MC; label constructs.

The AsmPrinter base class provides a number of useful; methods and routines, and also allows you to override the lowering process in; some important ways. You should get much of the lowering for free if you are; implementing an ELF, COFF, or MachO target, because the; TargetLoweringObjectFile class implements much of the common logic. #. Second, you need to implement an instruction printer for your target. The; instruction printer takes an `MCInst`_ and renders it to a raw_ostream as; text. Most of this is automatically generated from the .td file (when you; specify something like ""``add $dst, $src1, $src2``"" in the instructions), but; you need to implement routines to print operands. #. Third, you need to implement code that lowers a `MachineInstr`_ to an MCInst,; usually implemented in ""<target>MCInstLower.cpp"". This lowering process is; often target specific, and is responsible for turning jump table entries,; constant pool indices, global variable addresses, etc into MCLabels as; appropriate. This translation layer is also responsible for expanding pseudo; ops used by the code generator into the actual machine instructions they; correspond to. The MCInsts that are generated by this are fed into the; instruction printer or the encoder. Finally, at your choosing, you can also implement a subclass of MCCodeEmitter; which lowers MCInst's into machine code bytes and relocations. This is; important if you want to support direct .o file emission, or would like to; implement an assembler for your target.

Representing X86 addressing modes in MachineInstrs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The x86 has a very flexible way of accessing memory. It is capable of forming; memory addresses of the following expression directly in integer instructions; (which use ModR/M addressing):. ::. SegmentReg: Base + [1,2,4,8] * IndexReg + Disp32. In order to represent this, LLVM tracks no less than 5 operands for each memory; operand of this form.

Index: 0 | 1 2 3 4 5; Meaning: DestReg, | BaseReg, Scale, IndexReg, Displacement Segment; OperandTy: VirtReg, | VirtReg, UnsImm, VirtReg, SignExtImm PhysReg.

X86 address spaces supported; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. x86 has a feature which provides the ability to perform loads and stores to; different address spaces via the x86 segment registers. A segment override; prefix byte on an instruction causes the instruction's memory access to go to; the specified segment. LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed.

LLVM uses a PC relative; (PIC) or static addressing for accessing global values, so no TOC (r2) is; used. Second, r31 is used as a frame pointer to allow dynamic growth of a stack; frame. LLVM takes advantage of having no TOC to provide space to save the frame; pointer in the PowerPC linkage area of the caller frame. Other details of; PowerPC ABI can be found at `PowerPC ABI; <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/Articles/32bitPowerPC.html>`_\; . Note: This link describes the 32 bit ABI. The 64 bit ABI is similar except; space for GPRs are 8 bytes wide (not 4) and r13 is reserved for system use. Frame Layout; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The size of a PowerPC frame is usually fixed for the duration of a function's; invocation. Since the frame is fixed size, all references into the frame can be; accessed via fixed offsets from the stack pointer. The exception to this is; when dynamic alloca or variable sized arrays are present, then a base pointer; (r31) is used as a proxy for the stack pointer and stack pointer is free to grow; or shrink. A base pointer is also used if llvm-gcc is not passed the; -fomit-frame-pointer flag. The stack pointer is always aligned to 16 bytes, so; that space allocated for altivec vectors will be properly aligned.

Combining the information about the linkage, parameter areas and alignment. A; stack frame is minimally 64 bytes in 32 bit mode and 128 bytes in 64 bit mode. The *dynamic area* starts out as size zero. If a function uses dynamic alloca; then space is added to the stack, the linkage and parameter areas are shifted to; top of stack, and the new space is available immediately below the linkage and; parameter areas. The cost of shifting the linkage and parameter areas is minor; since only the link value needs to be copied. The link value can be easily; fetched by adding the original frame size to the base pointer. Note that; allocations in the dynamic space need to observe 16 byte alignment. The *locals area* is where the llvm compiler reserves space for local variables. The *saved registers area* is where the llvm compiler spills callee saved; registers on entry to the callee. Prolog/Epilog; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The llvm prolog and epilog are the same as described in the PowerPC ABI, with; the following exceptions. Callee saved registers are spilled after the frame is; created. This allows the llvm epilog/prolog support to be common with other; targets. The base pointer callee saved register r31 is saved in the TOC slot of; linkage area.

This phase takes a legal SelectionDAG as input, pattern matches the; instructions supported by the target to this DAG, and produces a new DAG of; target code. For example, consider the following LLVM fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. %t1 = fadd float %W, %X; %t2 = fmul float %t1, %Y; %t3 = fadd float %t2, %Z. This LLVM code corresponds to a SelectionDAG that looks basically like this:. .. code-block:: text. (fadd:f32 (fmul:f32 (fadd:f32 W, X), Y), Z). If a target supports floating point multiply-and-add (FMA) operations, one of; the adds can be merged with the multiply. On the PowerPC, for example, the; output of the instruction selector might look like this DAG:. ::. (FMADDS (FADDS W, X), Y, Z). The ``FMADDS`` instruction is a ternary instruction that multiplies its first; two operands and adds the third (as single-precision floating-point numbers).; The ``FADDS`` instruction is a simple binary single-precision add instruction.; To perform this pattern match, the PowerPC backend includes the following; instruction definitions:. .. code-block:: text; :emphasize-lines: 4-5,9. def FMADDS : AForm_1<59, 29,; (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC, F4RC:$FRB),; ""fmadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRC, $FRB"",; [(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd (fmul F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC),; F4RC:$FRB))]>;; def FADDS : AForm_2<59, 21,; (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB),; ""fadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRB"",; [(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB))]>;.

See; ``llvm/CodeGen/DFAPacketizer.h`` for more information. Implementing a Native Assembler; ===============================. Though you're probably reading this because you want to write or maintain a; compiler backend, LLVM also fully supports building a native assembler.; We've tried hard to automate the generation of the assembler from the .td files; (in particular the instruction syntax and encodings), which means that a large; part of the manual and repetitive data entry can be factored and shared with the; compiler. Instruction Parsing; -------------------. .. note::. To Be Written. Instruction Alias Processing; ----------------------------. Once the instruction is parsed, it enters the MatchInstructionImpl function.; The MatchInstructionImpl function performs alias processing and then does actual; matching. Alias processing is the phase that canonicalizes different lexical forms of the; same instructions down to one representation. There are several different kinds; of alias that are possible to implement and they are listed below in the order; that they are processed (which is in order from simplest/weakest to most; complex/powerful). Generally you want to use the first alias mechanism that; meets the needs of your instruction, because it will allow a more concise; description. Mnemonic Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first phase of alias processing is simple instruction mnemonic remapping for; classes of instructions which are allowed with two different mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

Function calls; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Function call arguments are passed using up to five registers (R1 - R5).; The return value is passed in a dedicated register (R0). Four additional; registers (R6 - R9) are callee-saved, and the values in these registers; are preserved within kernel functions. R0 - R5 are scratch registers within; kernel functions, and eBPF programs must therefor store/restore values in; these registers if needed across function calls. The stack can be accessed; using the read-only frame pointer R10. eBPF registers map 1:1 to hardware; registers on x86_64 and other 64-bit architectures. For example, x86_64; in-kernel JIT maps them as. ::. R0 - rax; R1 - rdi; R2 - rsi; R3 - rdx; R4 - rcx; R5 - r8; R6 - rbx; R7 - r13; R8 - r14; R9 - r15; R10 - rbp. since x86_64 ABI mandates rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9 for argument passing; and rbx, r12 - r15 are callee saved.

Each virtual register can only be mapped to physical registers of a; particular class. For instance, in the X86 architecture, some virtuals can only; be allocated to 8 bit registers. A register class is described by; ``TargetRegisterClass`` objects. To discover if a virtual register is; compatible with a given physical, this code can be used:. .. code-block:: c++. bool RegMapping_Fer::compatible_class(MachineFunction &mf,; unsigned v_reg,; unsigned p_reg) {; assert(TargetRegisterInfo::isPhysicalRegister(p_reg) &&; ""Target register must be physical"");; const TargetRegisterClass *trc = mf.getRegInfo().getRegClass(v_reg);; return trc->contains(p_reg);; }. Sometimes, mostly for debugging purposes, it is useful to change the number of; physical registers available in the target architecture. This must be done; statically, inside the ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file. Just ``grep`` for; ``RegisterClass``, the last parameter of which is a list of registers. Just; commenting some out is one simple way to avoid them being used. A more polite; way is to explicitly exclude some registers from the *allocation order*. See the; definition of the ``GR8`` register class in; ``lib/Target/X86/X86RegisterInfo.td`` for an example of this. Virtual registers are also denoted by integer numbers. Contrary to physical; registers, different virtual registers never share the same number. Whereas; physical registers are statically defined in a ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file; and cannot be created by the application developer, that is not the case with; virtual registers. In order to create new virtual registers, use the method; ``MachineRegisterInfo::createVirtualRegister()``. This method will return a new; virtual register. Use an ``IndexedMap<Foo, VirtReg2IndexFunctor>`` to hold; information per virtual register.

This method will return the stack; slot where ``vreg``'s value will be located. If it is necessary to map another; virtual register to the same stack slot, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg, stack_location)``. One important point; to consider when using the indirect mapping, is that even if a virtual register; is mapped to memory, it still needs to be mapped to a physical register. This; physical register is the location where the virtual register is supposed to be; found before being stored or after being reloaded. If the indirect strategy is used, after all the virtual registers have been; mapped to physical registers or stack slots, it is necessary to use a spiller; object to place load and store instructions in the code. Every virtual that has; been mapped to a stack slot will be stored to memory after being defined and will; be loaded before being used. The implementation of the spiller tries to recycle; load/store instructions, avoiding unnecessary instructions. For an example of; how to invoke the spiller, see ``RegAllocLinearScan::runOnMachineFunction`` in; ``lib/CodeGen/RegAllocLinearScan.cpp``. Handling two address instructions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. With very rare exceptions (e.g., function calls), the LLVM machine code; instructions are three address instructions. That is, each instruction is; expected to define at most one register, and to use at most two registers.; However, some architectures use two address instructions. In this case, the; defined register is also one of the used registers. For instance, an instruction; such as ``ADD %EAX, %EBX``, in X86 is actually equivalent to ``%EAX = %EAX +; %EBX``. In order to produce correct code, LLVM must convert three address instructions; that represent two address instructions into true two address instructions.

It; must be run before regis",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

After its execution, the; resulting code may no longer be in SSA form. This happens, for instance, in; situations where an instruction such as ``%a = ADD %b %c`` is converted to two; instructions such as:. ::. %a = MOVE %b; %a = ADD %a %c. Notice that, internally, the second instruction is represented as ``ADD; %a[def/use] %c``. I.e., the register operand ``%a`` is both used and defined by; the instruction. The SSA deconstruction phase; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An important transformation that happens during register allocation is called; the *SSA Deconstruction Phase*. The SSA form simplifies many analyses that are; performed on the control flow graph of programs. However, traditional; instruction sets do not implement PHI instructions. Thus, in order to generate; executable code, compilers must replace PHI instructions with other instructions; that preserve their semantics. There are many ways in which PHI instructions can safely be removed from the; target code. The most traditional PHI deconstruction algorithm replaces PHI; instructions with copy instructions. That is the strategy adopted by LLVM. The; SSA deconstruction algorithm is implemented in; ``lib/CodeGen/PHIElimination.cpp``. In order to invoke this pass, the identifier; ``PHIEliminationID`` must be marked as required in the code of the register; allocator. Instruction folding; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. *Instruction folding* is an optimization performed during register allocation; that removes unnecessary copy instructions. For instance, a sequence of; instructions such as:. ::. %EBX = LOAD %mem_address; %EAX = COPY %EBX. can be safely substituted by the single instruction:. ::. %EAX = LOAD %mem_address. Instructions can be folded with the; ``TargetRegisterInfo::foldMemoryOperand(...)`` method.

For instance, a sequence of; instructions such as:. ::. %EBX = LOAD %mem_address; %EAX = COPY %EBX. can be safely substituted by the single instruction:. ::. %EAX = LOAD %mem_address. Instructions can be folded with the; ``TargetRegisterInfo::foldMemoryOperand(...)`` method.

Introduction; ============. The LLVM target-independent code generator is a framework that provides a suite; of reusable components for translating the LLVM internal representation to the; machine code for a specified target---either in assembly form (suitable for a; static compiler) or in binary machine code format (usable for a JIT; compiler). The LLVM target-independent code generator consists of six main; components:. 1. `Abstract target description`_ interfaces which capture important properties; about various aspects of the machine, independently of how they will be used.; These interfaces are defined in ``include/llvm/Target/``. 2. Classes used to represent the `code being generated`_ for a target. These; classes are intended to be abstract enough to represent the machine code for; *any* target machine. These classes are defined in; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/``. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" are explicitly exposed. 3. Classes and algorithms used to represent code at the object file level, the; `MC Layer`_. These classes represent assembly level constructs like labels,; sections, and instructions. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" don't exist. 4. `Target-independent algorithms`_ used to implement various phases of native; code generation (register allocation, scheduling, stack frame representation,; etc). This code lives in ``lib/CodeGen/``. 5. `Implementations of the abstract target description interfaces`_ for; particular targets. These machine descriptions make use of the components; provided by LLVM, and can optionally provide custom target-specific passes,; to build complete code generators for a specific target. Target descriptions; live in ``lib/Target/``. 6. The target-independent JIT components.

The LLVM target description classes (located in the ``include/llvm/Target``; directory) provide an abstract description of the target machine independent of; any particular client.

This class is designed to be specialized by a concrete; target implementation (e.g., ``X86TargetMachine``) which implements the various; virtual methods.

Registers are represented in the code generator by unsigned integers. Physical; registers (those that actually exist in the target description) are unique; small numbers, and virtual registers are generally large. Note that; register ``#0`` is reserved as a flag value.

This graph; is based on the final SelectionDAG, with nodes that must be scheduled together; bundled into a single scheduling-unit node, and with immediate operands and; other nodes that aren't relevant for scheduling omitted. The option ``-filter-view-dags`` allows to select the name of the basic block; that you are interested to visualize and filters all the previous; ``view-*-dags`` options. .. _Build initial DAG:.

The initial SelectionDAG is na\ :raw-html:`&iuml;`\ vely peephole expanded from; the LLVM input by the ``SelectionDAGBuilder`` class. The intent of this pass; is to expose as much low-level, target-specific details to the SelectionDAG as; possible.

To obtain the integer code of a register, use; ``MachineOperand::getReg()``. An instruction may define or use a register. For; instance, ``ADD reg:1026 := reg:1025 reg:1024`` defines the registers 1024, and; uses registers 1025 and 1026. Given a register operand, the method; ``MachineOperand::isUse()`` informs if that register is being used by the; instruction. The method ``MachineOperand::isDef()`` informs if that registers is; being defined. We will call physical registers present in the LLVM bitcode before register; allocation *pre-colored registers*. Pre-colored registers are used in many; different situations, for instance, to pass parameters of functions calls, and; to store results of particular instructions. There are two types of pre-colored; registers: the ones *implicitly* defined, and those *explicitly*; defined. Explicitly defined registers are normal operands, and can be accessed; with ``MachineInstr::getOperand(int)::getReg()``. In order to check which; registers are implicitly defined by an instruction, use the; ``TargetInstrInfo::get(opcode)::ImplicitDefs``, where ``opcode`` is the opcode; of the target instruction. One important difference between explicit and; implicit physical registers is that the latter are defined statically for each; instruction, whereas the former may vary depending on the program being; compiled. For example, an instruction that represents a function call will; always implicitly define or use the same set of physical registers. To read the; registers implicitly used by an instruction, use; ``TargetInstrInfo::get(opcode)::ImplicitUses``. Pre-colored registers impose; constraints on any register allocation algorithm.

The information on; how to unwind a given function is traditionally expressed in DWARF unwind; (a.k.a. frame) info. But that format was originally developed for debuggers to; backtrace, and each Frame Description Entry (FDE) requires ~20-30 bytes per; function. There is also the cost of mapping from an address in a function to the; corresponding FDE at runtime. An alternative unwind encoding is called *compact; unwind* and requires just 4-bytes per function. The compact unwind encoding is a 32-bit value, which is encoded in an; architecture-specific way. It specifies which registers to restore and from; where, and how to unwind out of the function. When the linker creates a final; linked image, it will create a ``__TEXT,__unwind_info`` section. This section is; a small and fast way for the runtime to access unwind info for any given; function. If we emit compact unwind info for the function, that compact unwind; info will be encoded in the ``__TEXT,__unwind_info`` section. If we emit DWARF; unwind info, the ``__TEXT,__unwind_info`` section will contain the offset of the; FDE in the ``__TEXT,__eh_frame`` section in the final linked image. For X86, there are three modes for the compact unwind encoding:. *Function with a Frame Pointer (``EBP`` or ``RBP``)*; ``EBP/RBP``-based frame, where ``EBP/RBP`` is pushed onto the stack; immediately after the return address, then ``ESP/RSP`` is moved to; ``EBP/RBP``. Thus to unwind, ``ESP/RSP`` is restored with the current; ``EBP/RBP`` value, then ``EBP/RBP`` is restored by popping the stack, and the; return is done by popping the stack once more into the PC. All non-volatile; registers that need to be restored must have been saved in a small range on; the stack that starts ``EBP-4`` to ``EBP-1020`` (``RBP-8`` to; ``RBP-1020``).

The *parameter area* is used to store arguments being passed to a callee; function. Following the PowerPC ABI, the first few arguments are actually; passed in registers, with the space in the parameter area unused. However, if; there are not enough registers or the callee is a thunk or vararg function,; these register arguments can be spilled into the parameter area. Thus, the; parameter area must be large enough to store all the parameters for the largest; call sequence made by the caller. The size must also be minimally large enough; to spill registers r3-r10. This allows callees blind to the call signature,; such as thunks and vararg functions, enough space to cache the argument; registers. Therefore, the parameter area is minimally 32 bytes (64 bytes in 64; bit mode.) Also note that since the parameter area is a fixed offset from the; top of the frame, that a callee can access its split arguments using fixed; offsets from the stack pointer (or base pointer.). Combining the information about the linkage, parameter areas and alignment. A; stack frame is minimally 64 bytes in 32 bit mode and 128 bytes in 64 bit mode. The *dynamic area* starts out as size zero. If a function uses dynamic alloca; then space is added to the stack, the linkage and parameter areas are shifted to; top of stack, and the new space is available immediately below the linkage and; parameter areas. The cost of shifting the linkage and parameter areas is minor; since only the link value needs to be copied. The link value can be easily; fetched by adding the original frame size to the base pointer. Note that; allocations in the dynamic space need to observe 16 byte alignment. The *locals area* is where the llvm compiler reserves space for local variables. The *saved registers area* is where the llvm compiler spills callee saved; registers on entry to the callee.

The ``TargetFrameLowering`` class is used to provide information about the stack; frame layout of the target.

The ``TargetJITInfo`` class; ---------------------------. The ``TargetJITInfo`` class exposes an abstract interface used by the; Just-In-Time code generator to perform target-specific activities, such as; emitting stubs.

Fixed (preassigned) registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One important issue that the code generator needs to be aware of is the presence; of fixed registers. In particular, there are often places in the instruction; stream where the register allocator *must* arrange for a particular value to be; in a particular register. This can occur due to limitations of the instruction; set (e.g., the X86 can only do a 32-bit divide with the ``EAX``/``EDX``; registers), or external factors like calling conventions. In any case, the; instruction selector should emit code that copies a virtual register into or out; of a physical register when needed. For example, consider this simple LLVM example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32 %X, i32 %Y) {; %Z = sdiv i32 %X, %Y; ret i32 %Z; }. The X86 instruction selector might produce this machine code for the ``div`` and; ``ret``:. .. code-block:: text. ;; Start of div; %EAX = mov %reg1024 ;; Copy X (in reg1024) into EAX; %reg1027 = sar %reg1024, 31; %EDX = mov %reg1027 ;; Sign extend X into EDX; idiv %reg1025 ;; Divide by Y (in reg1025); %reg1026 = mov %EAX ;; Read the result (Z) out of EAX. ;; Start of ret; %EAX = mov %reg1026 ;; 32-bit return value goes in EAX; ret. By the end of code generation, the register allocator would coalesce the; registers and delete the resultant identity moves producing the following; code:. .. code-block:: text. ;; X is in EAX, Y is in ECX; mov %EAX, %EDX; sar %EDX, 31; idiv %ECX; ret. This approach is extremely general (if it can handle the X86 architecture, it; can handle anything!) and allows all of the target specific knowledge about the; instruction stream to be isolated in the instruction selector.

In; the code generator, the `Code Emission`_ phase of the code generator lowers; higher level LLVM IR and Machine* constructs down to the MC layer, emitting; directives through MCStreamer. On the implementation side of MCStreamer, there are two major implementations:; one for writing out a .s file (MCAsmStreamer), and one for writing out a .o; file (MCObjectStreamer). MCAsmStreamer is a straightforward implementation; that prints out a directive for each method (e.g. ``EmitValue -> .byte``), but; MCObjectStreamer implements a full assembler. For target specific directives, the MCStreamer has a MCTargetStreamer instance.; Each target that needs it defines a class that inherits from it and is a lot; like MCStreamer itself: It has one method per directive and two classes that; inherit from it, a target object streamer and a target asm streamer. The target; asm streamer just prints it (``emitFnStart -> .fnstart``), and the object; streamer implement the assembler logic for it.

These physical; registers are marked as *aliased* in LLVM. Given a particular architecture, you; can check which registers are aliased by inspecting its ``RegisterInfo.td``; file. Moreover, the class ``MCRegAliasIterator`` enumerates all the physical; registers aliased to a register. Physical registers, in LLVM, are grouped in *Register Classes*. Elements in the; same register class are functionally equivalent, and can be interchangeably; used. Each virtual register can only be mapped to physical registers of a; particular class. For instance, in the X86 architecture, some virtuals can only; be allocated to 8 bit registers. A register class is described by; ``TargetRegisterClass`` objects. To discover if a virtual register is; compatible with a given physical, this code can be used:. .. code-block:: c++. bool RegMapping_Fer::compatible_class(MachineFunction &mf,; unsigned v_reg,; unsigned p_reg) {; assert(TargetRegisterInfo::isPhysicalRegister(p_reg) &&; ""Target register must be physical"");; const TargetRegisterClass *trc = mf.getRegInfo().getRegClass(v_reg);; return trc->contains(p_reg);; }.

This must be done; statically, inside the ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file. Just ``grep`` for; ``RegisterClass``, the last parameter of which is a list of registers. Just; commenting some out is one simple way to avoid them being used. A more polite; way is to explicitly exclude some registers from the *allocation order*. See the; definition of the ``GR8`` register class in; ``lib/Target/X86/X86RegisterInfo.td`` for an example of this. Virtual registers are also denoted by integer numbers.

This is an abstract API that is implemented in different ways; (e.g. to output a .s file, output an ELF .o file, etc) that is effectively an; ""assembler API"". MCStreamer has one method per directive, such as EmitLabel,; EmitSymbolAttribute, switchSection, etc, which directly correspond to assembly; level directives. If you are interested in implementing a code generator for a target, there are; three important things that you have to implement for your target:. #. First, you need a subclass of AsmPrinter for your target. This class; implements the general lowering process converting MachineFunction's into MC; label constructs.

Third, you need to implement code that lowers a `MachineInstr`_ to an MCInst,; usually implemented in ""<target>MCInstLower.cpp"". This lowering process is; often target specific, and is responsible for turning jump table entries,; constant pool indices, global variable addresses, etc into MCLabels as; appropriate.

Introduction; ============. The LLVM target-independent code generator is a framework that provides a suite; of reusable components for translating the LLVM internal representation to the; machine code for a specified target---either in assembly form (suitable for a; static compiler) or in binary machine code format (usable for a JIT; compiler). The LLVM target-independent code generator consists of six main; components:. 1. `Abstract target description`_ interfaces which capture important properties; about various aspects of the machine, independently of how they will be used.; These interfaces are defined in ``include/llvm/Target/``. 2. Classes used to represent the `code being generated`_ for a target. These; classes are intended to be abstract enough to represent the machine code for; *any* target machine. These classes are defined in; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/``. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" are explicitly exposed. 3. Classes and algorithms used to represent code at the object file level, the; `MC Layer`_. These classes represent assembly level constructs like labels,; sections, and instructions. At this level, concepts like ""constant pool; entries"" and ""jump tables"" don't exist. 4. `Target-independent algorithms`_ used to implement various phases of native; code generation (register allocation, scheduling, stack frame representati",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

At the high-level, LLVM code is translated to a machine specific representation; formed out of :raw-html:`<tt>` `MachineFunction`_ :raw-html:`</tt>`,; :raw-html:`<tt>` `MachineBasicBlock`_ :raw-html:`</tt>`, and :raw-html:`<tt>`; `MachineInstr`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` instances (defined in; ``include/llvm/CodeGen``). This representation is completely target agnostic,; representing instructions in their most abstract form: an opcode and a series of; operands. This representation is designed to support both an SSA representation; for machine code, as well as a register allocated, non-SSA form. .. _MachineInstr:. The ``MachineInstr`` class; --------------------------. Target machine instructions are represented as instances of the ``MachineInstr``; class. This class is an extremely abstract way of representing machine; instructions. In particular, it only keeps track of an opcode number and a set; of operands. The opcode number is a simple unsigned integer that only has meaning to a; specific backend. All of the instructions for a target should be defined in the; ``*InstrInfo.td`` file for the target. The opcode enum values are auto-generated; from this description. The ``MachineInstr`` class does not have any information; about how to interpret the instruction (i.e., what the semantics of the; instruction are); for that you must refer to the :raw-html:`<tt>`; `TargetInstrInfo`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class. The operands of a machine instruction can be of several different types: a; register reference, a constant integer, a basic block reference, etc. In; addition, a machine operand should be marked as a def or a use of the value; (though only registers are allowed to be defs). By convention, the LLVM code generator orders instruction operands so that all; register definitions come before the register uses, even on architectures that; are normally printed in other orders. For example, the SPARC add instruction:; ""``add %i1, %i2, %i3``"" adds ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

If you need to add a definition operand (other than the optional destination; register), you must explicitly mark it as such:. .. code-block:: c++. MI.addReg(Reg, RegState::Define);. Fixed (preassigned) registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One important issue that the code generator needs to be aware of is the presence; of fixed registers. In particular, there are often places in the instruction; stream where the register allocator *must* arrange for a particular value to be; in a particular register. This can occur due to limitations of the instruction; set (e.g., the X86 can only do a 32-bit divide with the ``EAX``/``EDX``; registers), or external factors like calling conventions. In any case, the; instruction selector should emit code that copies a virtual register into or out; of a physical register when needed. For example, consider this simple LLVM example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32 %X, i32 %Y) {; %Z = sdiv i32 %X, %Y; ret i32 %Z; }. The X86 instruction selector might produce this machine code for the ``div`` and; ``ret``:. .. code-block:: text. ;; Start of div; %EAX = mov %reg1024 ;; Copy X (in reg1024) into EAX; %reg1027 = sar %reg1024, 31; %EDX = mov %reg1027 ;; Sign extend X into EDX; idiv %reg1025 ;; Divide by Y (in reg1025); %reg1026 = mov %EAX ;; Read the result (Z) out of EAX. ;; Start of ret; %EAX = mov %reg1026 ;; 32-bit return value goes in EAX; ret. By the end of code generation, the register allocator would coalesce the; registers and delete the resultant identity moves producing the following; code:. .. code-block:: text. ;; X is in EAX, Y is in ECX; mov %EAX, %EDX; sar %EDX, 31; idiv %ECX; ret. This approach is extremely general (if it can handle the X86 architecture, it; can handle anything!) and allows all of the target specific knowledge about the; instruction stream to be isolat",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst

Note that; physical registers should have a short lifetime for good code generation, and; all physical registers are assumed dead on entry to and exit from basic blocks; (before register allocation). Thus, if you need a value to be live across basic; block boundaries, it *must* live in a virtual register. Call-clobbered registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some machine instructions, like calls, clobber a large number of physical; registers. Rather than adding ``<def,dead>`` operands for all of them, it is; possible to use an ``MO_RegisterMask`` operand instead. The register mask; operand holds a bit mask of preserved registers, and everything else is; considered to be clobbered by the instruction. Machine code in SSA form; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``MachineInstr``'s are initially selected in SSA-form, and are maintained in; SSA-form until register allocation happens. For the most part, this is; trivially simple since LLVM is already in SSA form; LLVM PHI nodes become; machine code PHI nodes, and virtual registers are only allowed to have a single; definition. After register allocation, machine code is no longer in SSA-form because there; are no virtual registers left in the code. .. _MachineBasicBlock:. The ``MachineBasicBlock`` class; -------------------------------. The ``MachineBasicBlock`` class contains a list of machine instructions; (:raw-html:`<tt>` `MachineInstr`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` instances). It roughly; corresponds to the LLVM code input to the instruction selector, but there can be; a one-to-many mapping (i.e. one LLVM basic block can map to multiple machine; basic blocks).

The various operation node types are described at the top of the; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h`` file. Although most operations define a single value, each node in the graph may; define multiple values. For example, a combined div/rem operation will define; both the dividend and the remainder. Many other situations require multiple; values as well. Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges to; the node defining the used value. Because nodes may define multiple values,; edges are represented by instances of the ``SDValue`` class, which is a; ``<SDNode, unsigned>`` pair, indicating the node and result value being used,; respectively. Each value produced by an ``SDNode`` has an associated ``MVT``; (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is. SelectionDAGs contain two different kinds of values: those that represent data; flow and those that represent control flow dependencies. Data values are simple; edges with an integer or floating point value type. Control edges are; represented as ""chain"" edges which are of type ``MVT::Other``. These edges; provide an ordering between nodes that have side effects (such as loads, stores,; calls, returns, etc). All nodes that have side effects should take a token; chain as input and produce a new one as output. By convention, token chain; inputs are always operand #0, and chain results are always the last value; produced by an operation. However, after instruction selection, the; machine nodes have their chain after the instruction's operands, and; may be followed by glue nodes. A SelectionDAG has designated ""Entry"" and ""Root"" nodes. The Entry node is; always a marker node with an Opcode of ``ISD::EntryToken``.

The Select phase is the bulk of the target-specific code for instruction; selection. This phase takes a legal SelectionDAG as input, pattern matches the; instructions supported by the target to this DAG, and produces a new DAG of; target code. For example, consider the following LLVM fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. %t1 = fadd float %W, %X; %t2 = fmul float %t1, %Y; %t3 = fadd float %t2, %Z. This LLVM code corresponds to a SelectionDAG that looks basically like this:. .. code-block:: text. (fadd:f32 (fmul:f32 (fadd:f32 W, X), Y), Z). If a target supports floating point multiply-and-add (FMA) operations, one of; the adds can be merged with the multiply. On the PowerPC, for example, the; output of the instruction selector might look like this DAG:. ::. (FMADDS (FADDS W, X), Y, Z). The ``FMADDS`` instruction is a ternary instruction that multiplies its first; two operands and adds the third (as single-precision floating-point numbers).; The ``FADDS`` instruction is a simple binary single-precision add instruction.; To perform this pattern match, the PowerPC backend includes the following; instruction definitions:. .. code-block:: text; :emphasize-lines: 4-5,9. def FMADDS : AForm_1<59, 29,; (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC, F4RC:$FRB),; ""fmadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRC, $FRB"",; [(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd (fmul F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC),; F4RC:$FRB))]>;; def FADDS : AForm_2<59, 21,; (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB),; ""fadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRB"",; [(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB))]>;. The highlighted portion of the instruction definitions indicates the pattern; used to match the instructions. The DAG operators (like ``fmul``/``fadd``); are defined in the ``include/llvm/Target/TargetSelectionDAG.td`` file.; ""``F4RC``"" is the register class of the input and result values. The TableGen DAG instruction selector generator reads the instruction patterns; in the ``.td`` file and automatically builds parts of the pattern matching code; for your target.

Each virtual register can only be mapped to physical registers of a; particular class. For instance, in the X86 architecture, some virtuals can only; be allocated to 8 bit registers. A register class is described by; ``TargetRegisterClass`` objects. To discover if a virtual register is; compatible with a given physical, this code can be used:. .. code-block:: c++. bool RegMapping_Fer::compatible_class(MachineFunction &mf,; unsigned v_reg,; unsigned p_reg) {; assert(TargetRegisterInfo::isPhysicalRegister(p_reg) &&; ""Target register must be physical"");; const TargetRegisterClass *trc = mf.getRegInfo().getRegClass(v_reg);; return trc->contains(p_reg);; }. Sometimes, mostly for debugging purposes, it is useful to change the number of; physical registers available in the target architecture. This must be done; statically, inside the ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file. Just ``grep`` for; ``RegisterClass``, the last parameter of which is a list of registers. Just; commenting some out is one simple way to avoid them being used. A more polite; way is to explicitly exclude some registers from the *allocation order*. See the; definition of the ``GR8`` register class in; ``lib/Target/X86/X86RegisterInfo.td`` for an example of this. Virtual registers are also denoted by integer numbers. Contrary to physical; registers, different virtual registers never share the same number. Whereas; physical registers are statically defined in a ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file; and cannot be created by the application developer, that is not the case with; virtual registers. In order to create new virtual registers, use the method; ``MachineRegisterInfo::createVirtualRegister()``. This method will return a new; virtual register. Use an ``IndexedMap<Foo, VirtReg2IndexFunctor>`` to hold; information per virtual register.

In order to produce correct code, LLVM must convert three address instructions; that represent two address instructions into true two address instructions. LLVM; provides the pass ``TwoAddressInstructionPass`` for this specific purpose. It; must be run before register allocation takes place. After its execution, the; resulting code may no longer be in SSA form. This happens, for instance, in; situations where an instruction such as ``%a = ADD %b %c`` is converted to two; instructions such as:. ::. %a = MOVE %b; %a = ADD %a %c. Notice that, internally, the second instruction is represented as ``ADD; %a[def/use] %c``. I.e., the register operand ``%a`` is both used and defined by; the instruction.

Thus, in order to generate; executable code, compilers must replace PHI instructions with other instructions; that preserve their semantics. There are many ways in which PHI instructions can safely be removed from the; target code. The most traditional PHI deconstruction algorithm replaces PHI; instructions with copy instructions. That is the strategy adopted by LLVM. The; SSA deconstruction algorithm is implemented in; ``lib/CodeGen/PHIElimination.cpp``. In order to invoke this pass, the identifier; ``PHIEliminationID`` must be marked as required in the code of the register; allocator.

The states represent the possible consumption of functional units by; instructions in a packet. In the DFA, transitions from one state to another; occur on the addition of an instruction to an existing packet. If there is a; legal mapping of functional units to instructions, then the DFA contains a; corresponding transition. The absence of a transition indicates that a legal; mapping does not exist and that the instruction cannot be added to the packet.

The result of instruction aliases can include operands in a; different order than the destination instruction, and can use an input multiple; times, for example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""clrb $reg"", (XOR8rr GR8 :$reg, GR8 :$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrw $reg"", (XOR16rr GR16:$reg, GR16:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrl $reg"", (XOR32rr GR32:$reg, GR32:$reg)>;; def : InstAlias<""clrq $reg"", (XOR64rr GR64:$reg, GR64:$reg)>;. This example also shows that tied operands are only listed once. In the X86; backend, XOR8rr has two input GR8's and one output GR8 (where an input is tied; to the output). InstAliases take a flattened operand list without duplicates; for tied operands. The result of an instruction alias can also use immediates; and fixed physical registers which are added as simple immediate operands in the; result, for example:. ::. // Fixed Immediate operand.; def : InstAlias<""aad"", (AAD8i8 10)>;. // Fixed register operand.; def : InstAlias<""fcomi"", (COM_FIr ST1)>;. // Simple alias.; def : InstAlias<""fcomi $reg"", (COM_FIr RST:$reg)>;. Instruction aliases can also have a Requires clause to make them subtarget; specific. If the back-end supports it, the instruction printer can automatically emit the; alias rather than what's being aliased. It typically leads to better, more; readable code. If it's better to print out what's being aliased, then pass a '0'; as the third parameter to the InstAlias definition. Instruction Matching; --------------------. .. note::.

The cost of shifting the linkage and parameter areas is minor; since only the link value needs to be copied. The link value can be easily; fetched by adding the original frame size to the base pointer. Note that; allocations in the dynamic space need to observe 16 byte alignment. The *locals area* is where the llvm compiler reserves space for local variables. The *saved registers area* is where the llvm compiler spills callee saved; registers on entry to the callee. Prolog/Epilog; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The llvm prolog and epilog are the same as described in the PowerPC ABI, with; the following exceptions. Callee saved registers are spilled after the frame is; created. This allows the llvm epilog/prolog support to be common with other; targets. The base pointer callee saved register r31 is saved in the TOC slot of; linkage area. This simplifies allocation of space for the base pointer and; makes it convenient to locate programmatically and during debugging. Dynamic Allocation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. .. note::. TODO - More to come. The NVPTX backend; -----------------. The NVPTX code generator under lib/Target/NVPTX is an open-source version of; the NVIDIA NVPTX code generator for LLVM. It is contributed by NVIDIA and is; a port of the code generator used in the CUDA compiler (nvcc).

To; that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:. * `be friendly and patient`_,; * `be welcoming`_,; * `be considerate`_,; * `be respectful`_,; * `be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others`_, and; * `when we disagree, try to understand why`_. This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in; the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate; and participate in the community. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the LLVM project or The; LLVM Foundation. This includes IRC channels, mailing lists, bug trackers, LLVM; events such as the developer meetings and socials, and any other forums created; by the project that the community uses for communication. It applies to all of; your communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats, things; you say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even t-shirts you display in these; spaces. . In rare cases, violations of this code outside of these spaces may affect a ; person’s ability to participate within these spaces. Important examples ; include `sexual and gender-based violence`_, `hate crimes`_, and `hate speech`_. ; We do not conduct proactive research, but we have an obligation to respond ; to any reported concerns. We are not interested in evaluating severity, ; responding punitively, or holding people accountable. Both the relevance ; and our response is instead focused on how a person’s continued participation ; impacts the community’s safety, wellbeing, and inclusivity.

In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Persisting in such; behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment. .. _when we disagree, try to understand why:. * **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and; technical, happen all the time and LLVM is no exception. It is important that; we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that; we're different. The strength of LLVM comes from its varied community, people; from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different; perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds; a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to; err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping; to resolve issues and learning from mistakes. Reporting; =========. If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct you can always report; it to the LLVM Foundation Code of Conduct Committee by emailing; conduct@llvm.org. All reports will be kept confidential. This isn't a public; list and only members of the advisory committee will receive the report. For; details on what to include in the report, please see the :doc:`Reporting Guide; <ReportingGuide>`. If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law; enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is; appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify; them. If the violation occurs at an event such as a Developer Meeting and requires; immediate attention, you can also reach out to any of the event organizers or; staff.

LLVM's code-review policy and practices help maintain high code quality across; the project.

What Code Should Be Reviewed?; -----------------------------. All developers are required to have significant changes reviewed before they; are committed to the repository. Must Code Be Reviewed Prior to Being Committed?; -----------------------------------------------. Code can be reviewed either before it is committed or after. We expect; significant patches to be reviewed before being committed. Smaller patches; (or patches where the developer owns the component) that meet; likely-community-consensus requirements (as apply to all patch approvals) can; be committed prior to an explicit review. In situations where there is any; uncertainty, a patch should be reviewed prior to being committed. Please note that the developer responsible for a patch is also; responsible for making all necessary review-related changes, including; those requested during any post-commit review. .. _post_commit_review:. Can Code Be Reviewed After It Is Committed?; -------------------------------------------. Post-commit review is encouraged, and can be accomplished using any of the; tools detailed below.

Can Code Be Reviewed After It Is Committed?; -------------------------------------------. Post-commit review is encouraged, and can be accomplished using any of the; tools detailed below. There is a strong expectation that authors respond; promptly to post-commit feedback and address it. Failure to do so is cause for; the patch to be :ref:`reverted <revert_policy>`. If a community member expresses a concern about a recent commit, and this; concern would have been significant enough to warrant a conversation during; pre-commit review (including around the need for more design discussions),; they may ask for a revert to the original author who is responsible to revert; the patch promptly. Developers often disagree, and erring on the side of the; developer asking for more review prevents any lingering disagreement over; code in the tree. This does not indicate any fault from the patch author,; this is inherent to our post-commit review practices.; Reverting a patch ensures that design discussions can happen without blocking; other development; it's entirely possible the patch will end up being reapplied; essentially as-is once concerns have been resolved. Before being recommitted, the patch generally should undergo further review.; The community member who identified the problem is expected to engage; actively in the review. In cases where the problem is identified by a buildbot,; a community member with access to hardware similar to that on the buildbot is; expected to engage in the review. Please note: The bar for post-commit feedback is not higher than for pre-commit; feedback. Don't delay unnecessarily in providing feedback. However, if you see; something after code has been committed about which you would have commented; pre-commit (had you noticed it earlier), please feel free to provide that; feedback at any time.

That having been said, if a substantial period of time has passed since the; original change was committed, it may be better to create a new patch to; address the issues than comment on the original commit. The original patch; author, for example, might no longer be an active contributor to the project. What Tools Are Used for Code Review?; ------------------------------------. Pre-commit code reviews are conducted on GitHub with Pull Requests. See; :ref:`GitHub <github-reviews>` documentation. When Is an RFC Required?; ------------------------. Some changes are too significant for just a code review. Changes that should; change the LLVM Language Reference (e.g., adding new target-independent; intrinsics), adding language extensions in Clang, and so on, require an RFC; (Request for Comment) email on the project's ``*-dev`` mailing list first. For; changes that promise significant impact on users and/or downstream code bases,; reviewers can request an RFC achieving consensus before proceeding with code; review. That having been said, posting initial patches can help with; discussions on an RFC. Code-Review Workflow; ====================. Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is; ready to be committed. Specifically, once a patch is sent out for review, it; needs an explicit approval before it is committed. Do not assume silent; approval, or solicit objections to a patch with a deadline. Acknowledge All Reviewer Feedback; ---------------------------------. All comments by reviewers should be acknowledged by the patch author. It is; generally expected that suggested changes will be incorporated into a future; revision of the patch unless the author and/or other reviewers can articulate a; good reason to do otherwise (and then the reviewers must agree). If a new patch; does not address all outstanding feedback, the author should explicitly state; that when providing the updated",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeReview.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeReview.rst

LGTM - How a Patch Is Accepted; ------------------------------. A patch is approved to be committed when a reviewer accepts it, and this is; almost always associated with a message containing the text ""LGTM"" (which; stands for Looks Good To Me). Only approval from a single reviewer is required. When providing an unqualified LGTM (approval to commit), it is the; responsibility of the reviewer to have reviewed all of the discussion and; feedback from all reviewers ensuring that all feedback has been addressed and; that all other reviewers will almost surely be satisfied with the patch being; approved. If unsure, the reviewer should provide a qualified approval, (e.g.,; ""LGTM, but please wait for @someone, @someone_else""). You may also do this if; you are fairly certain that a particular community member will wish to review,; even if that person hasn't done so yet. Note that, if a reviewer has requested a particular community member to review,; and after a week that community member has yet to respond, feel free to ping; the patch (which literally means submitting a comment on the patch with the; word, ""Ping.""), or alternatively, ask the original reviewer for further; suggestions. If it is likely that others will want to review a recently-posted patch,; especially if there might be objections, but no one else has done so yet, it is; also polite to provide a qualified approval (e.g., ""LGTM, but please wait for a; couple of days in case others wish to review""). If approval is received very; quickly, a patch author may also elect to wait before committing (and this is; certainly considered polite for non-trivial patches). Especially given the; global nature of our community, this waiting time should be at least 24 hours.; Please also be mindful of weekends and major holidays. Our goal is to ensure community consensus around design decisions and; significant implementation choices, and one responsibility of a reviewer, when; providing an overall approval for a patch, is t",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeReview.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeReview.rst

Experts Should Review Code; --------------------------. If you are an expert in an area of the compiler affected by a proposed patch,; then you are highly encouraged to review the code. If you are a relevant code; owner, and no other experts are reviewing a patch, you must either help arrange; for an expert to review the patch or review it yourself. Code Reviews, Speed, and Reciprocity; ------------------------------------. Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you might hope, especially for; larger features. Common ways to speed up review times for your patches are:. * Review other people's patches.

Developers on IRC will be able to either help you; directly, or tell you who might be a good reviewer.; * Split your patch into multiple smaller patches that build on each other. The; smaller your patch is, the higher the probability that somebody will take a quick; look at it. When doing this, it is helpful to add ""[N/M]"" (for 1 <= N <= M) to; the title of each patch in the series, so it is clear that there is an order; and what that order is.

What Code Should Be Reviewed?; -----------------------------. All developers are required to have significant changes reviewed before they; are committed to the repository. Must Code Be Reviewed Prior to Being Committed?; -----------------------------------------------. Code can be reviewed either before it is committed or after.

Smaller patches; (or patches where the developer owns the component) that meet; likely-community-consensus requirements (as apply to all patch approvals) can; be committed prior to an explicit review.

Can Code Be Reviewed After It Is Committed?; -------------------------------------------. Post-commit review is encouraged, and can be accomplished using any of the; tools detailed below.

If you're not familiar enough with the community to know,; then you shouldn't be providing final approval to commit.

That having been said, posting initial patches can help with; discussions on an RFC. Code-Review Workflow; ====================. Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is; ready to be committed. Specifically, once a patch is sent out for review, it; needs an explicit approval before it is committed. Do not assume silent; approval, or solicit objections to a patch with a deadline. Acknowledge All Reviewer Feedback; ---------------------------------. All comments by reviewers should be acknowledged by the patch author. It is; generally expected that suggested changes will be incorporated into a future; revision of the patch unless the author and/or other reviewers can articulate a; good reason to do otherwise (and then the reviewers must agree).

A patch is approved to be committed when a reviewer accepts it, and this is; almost always associated with a message containing the text ""LGTM"" (which; stands for Looks Good To Me). Only approval from a single reviewer is required. When providing an unqualified LGTM (approval to commit), it is the; responsibility of the reviewer to have reviewed all of the discussion and; feedback from all reviewers ensuring that all feedback has been addressed and; that all other reviewers will almost surely be satisfied with the patch being; approved.

Moreover, reviewers can accept a patch conditioned on; the author applying some set of minor updates prior to committing, and when; applicable, it is polite for reviewers to do so. Don't Unintentionally Block a Review; ------------------------------------. If you review a patch, but don't intend for the review process to block on your; approval, please state that explicitly. Out of courtesy, we generally wait on; committing a patch until all reviewers are satisfied, and if you don't intend; to look at the patch again in a timely fashion, please communicate that fact in; the review. Who Can/Should Review Code?; ===========================. Non-Experts Should Review Code; ------------------------------. You do not need to be an expert in some area of the code base to review patches;; it's fine to ask questions about what some piece of code is doing. If it's not; clear to you what is going on, you're unlikely to be the only one. Please; remember that it is not in the long-term best interest of the community to have; components that are only understood well by a small number of people. Extra; comments and/or test cases can often help (and asking for comments in the test; cases is fine as well). Moreover, authors are encouraged to interpret questions as a reason to reexamine; the readability of the code in question. Structural changes, or further; comments, may be appropriate.

The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to increase the readability and; maintainability of our common source base. Languages, Libraries, and Standards; ===================================. Most source code in LLVM and other LLVM projects using these coding standards; is C++ code. There are some places where C code is used either due to; environment restrictions, historical restrictions, or due to third-party source; code imported into the tree. Generally, our preference is for standards; conforming, modern, and portable C++ code as the implementation language of; choice. For automation, build-systems and utility scripts Python is preferred and; is widely used in the LLVM repository already. C++ Standard Versions; ---------------------. Unless otherwise documented, LLVM subprojects are written using standard C++17; code and avoid unnecessary vendor-specific extensions. Nevertheless, we restrict ourselves to features which are available in the; major toolchains supported as host compilers (see :doc:`GettingStarted` page,; section `Software`). Each toolchain provides a good reference for what it accepts:. * Clang: https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html. * libc++: https://libcxx.llvm.org/Status/Cxx17.html. * GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17. * libstdc++: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#status.iso.2017. * MSVC: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx.

Do Not Use ``using namespace std``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"". In header files, adding a ``'using namespace XXX'`` directive pollutes the; namespace of any source file that ``#include``\s the header, creating; maintenance issues. In implementation files (e.g. ``.cpp`` files), the rule is more of a stylistic; rule, but is still important. Basically, using explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace. As such, it is",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

Feel free to skip the closing comment when the namespace being closed is; obvious for any reason. For example, the outer-most namespace in a header file; is rarely a source of confusion. But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper() {; ...; }. bool StringSort::operator<(const char *RHS) const {; ...; }.

Note that some code bases (e.g. ``libc++``) have special reasons to deviate; from the coding standards. For example, in the case of ``libc++``, this is; because the naming and other conventions are dictated by the C++ standard. There are some conventions that are not uniformly followed in the code base; (e.g. the naming convention). This is because they are relatively new, and a; lot of code was written before they were put in place. Our long term goal is; for the entire codebase to follow the convention, but we explicitly *do not*; want patches that do large-scale reformatting of existing code. On the other; hand, it is reasonable to rename the methods of a class if you're about to; change it in some other way. Please commit such changes separately to; make code review easier.

You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; a",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

The `Main Module Header`_ file applies to ``.cpp`` files which implement an; interface defined by a ``.h`` file. This ``#include`` should always be included; **first** regardless of where it lives on the file system. By including a; header file first in the ``.cpp`` files that implement the interfaces, we ensure; that the header does not have any hidden dependencies which are not explicitly; ``#include``\d in the header, but should be. It is also a form of documentation; in the ``.cpp`` file to indicate where the interfaces it implements are defined. LLVM project and subproject headers should be grouped from most specific to least; specific, for the same reasons described above. For example, LLDB depends on; both clang and LLVM, and clang depends on LLVM. So an LLDB source file should; include ``lldb`` headers first, followed by ``clang`` headers, followed by; ``llvm`` headers, to reduce the possibility (for example) of an LLDB header; accidentally picking up a missing include due to the previous inclusion of that; header in the main source file or some earlier header file. clang should; similarly include its own headers before including llvm headers. This rule; applies to all LLVM subprojects. .. _fit into 80 columns:. Source Code Width; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Write your code to fit within 80 columns. There must be some limit to the width of the code in; order to allow developers to have multiple files side-by-side in; windows on a modest display. If you are going to pick a width limit, it is; somewhat arbitrary but you might as well pick something standard. Going with 90; columns (for example) instead of 80 columns wouldn't add any significant value; and would be detrimental to printing out code. Also many other projects have; standardized on 80 columns, so some people have already configured their editors; for it (vs something else, like 90 columns). Whitespace; ^^^^^^^^^^.

Language and Compiler Issues; ----------------------------. Treat Compiler Warnings Like Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Compiler warnings are often useful and help improve the code. Those that are; not useful, can be often suppressed with a small code change. For example, an; assignment in the ``if`` condition is often a typo:. .. code-block:: c++. if (V = getValue()) {; ...; }. Several compilers will print a warning for the code above. It can be suppressed; by adding parentheses:. .. code-block:: c++. if ((V = getValue())) {; ...; }. Write Portable Code; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In almost all cases, it is possible to write completely portable code. When; you need to rely on non-portable code, put it behind a well-defined and; well-documented interface. Do not use RTTI or Exceptions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In an effort to reduce code and executable size, LLVM does not use exceptions; or RTTI (`runtime type information; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information>`_, for example,; ``dynamic_cast<>``). That said, LLVM does make extensive use of a hand-rolled form of RTTI that use; templates like :ref:`isa\<>, cast\<>, and dyn_cast\<> <isa>`.; This form of RTTI is opt-in and can be; :doc:`added to any class <HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI>`. Prefer C++-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When casting, use ``static_cast``, ``reinterpret_cast``, and ``const_cast``,; rather than C-style casts. There are two exceptions to this:. * When casting to ``void`` to suppress warnings about unused variables (as an; alternative to ``[[maybe_unused]]``). Prefer C-style casts in this instance. * When casting between integral types (including enums that are not strongly-; typed), functional-style casts are permitted as an alternative to; ``static_cast``. .. _static constructor:. Do not use Static Constructors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Static constructors ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

This error will not be caught until the build is nearly complete, when the; linker fails to find a definition for any uses of the original function. If the; function were instead defined with a namespace qualifier, the error would have; been caught immediately when the definition was compiled. Class method implementations must already name the class and new overloads; cannot be introduced out of line, so this recommendation does not apply to them. .. _early exits:. Use Early Exits and ``continue`` to Simplify Code; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When reading code, keep in mind how much state and how many previous decisions; have to be remembered by the reader to understand a block of code. Aim to; reduce indentation where possible when it doesn't make it more difficult to; understand the code. One great way to do this is by making use of early exits; and the ``continue`` keyword in long loops. Consider this code that does not; use an early exit:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *doSomething(Instruction *I) {; if (!I->isTerminator() &&; I->hasOneUse() && doOtherThing(I)) {; ... some long code ....; }. return 0;; }. This code has several problems if the body of the ``'if'`` is large. When; you're looking at the top of the function, it isn't immediately clear that this; *only* does interesting things with non-terminator instructions, and only; applies to things with the other predicates. Second, it is relatively difficult; to describe (in comments) why these predicates are important because the ``if``; statement makes it difficult to lay out the comments. Third, when you're deep; within the body of the code, it is indented an extra level. Finally, when; reading the top of the function, it isn't clear what the result is if the; pr",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

When you have very, very small loops, this sort of structure is fine. But if it; exceeds more than 10-15 lines, it becomes difficult for people to read and; understand at a glance. The problem with this sort of code is that it gets very; nested very quickly. Meaning that the reader of the code has to keep a lot of; context in their brain to remember what is going immediately on in the loop,; because they don't know if/when the ``if`` conditions will have ``else``\s etc.; It is strongly preferred to structure the loop like this:. .. code-block:: c++. for (Instruction &I : BB) {; auto *BO = dyn_cast<BinaryOperator>(&I);; if (!BO) continue;. Value *LHS = BO->getOperand(0);; Value *RHS = BO->getOperand(1);; if (LHS == RHS) continue;. ...; }. This has all the benefits of using early exits for functions: it reduces nesting; of the loop, it makes it easier to describe why the conditions are true, and it; makes it obvious to the reader that there is no ``else`` coming up that they; have to push context into their brain for. If a loop is large, this can be a; big understandability win. Don't use ``else`` after a ``return``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. For similar reasons as above (reduction of indentation and easier reading), please; do not use ``'else'`` or ``'else if'`` after something that interrupts control; flow --- like ``return``, ``break``, ``continue``, ``goto``, etc. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. case 'J': {; if (Signed) {; Type = Context.getsigjmp_bufType();; if (Type.isNull()) {; Error = ASTContext::GE_Missing_sigjmp_buf;; return QualType();; } else {; break; // Unnecessary.; }; } else {; Type = Context.getjmp_bufType();; if (Type.isNull()) {; Error = ASTContext::GE_Missing_jmp_buf;; return QualType();; } else {; break; // Unnecessary.; }; }; }.

Or better yet (in this case) as:. .. code-block:: c++. case 'J':; if (Signed); Type = Context.getsigjmp_bufType();; else; Type = Context.getjmp_bufType();. if (Type.isNull()) {; Error = Signed ? ASTContext::GE_Missing_sigjmp_buf :; ASTContext::GE_Missing_jmp_buf;; return QualType();; }; break;. The idea is to reduce indentation and the amount of code you have to keep track; of when reading the code. Note: this advice does not apply to a ``constexpr if`` statement. The; substatement of the ``else`` clause may be a discarded statement, so removing; the ``else`` can cause unexpected template instantiations. Thus, the following; example is correct:. .. code-block:: c++. template<typename T>; static constexpr bool VarTempl = true;. template<typename T>; int func() {; if constexpr (VarTempl<T>); return 1;; else; static_assert(!VarTempl<T>);; }.

Instead of this sort of loop, we prefer to use a predicate function (which may; be `static`_) that uses `early exits`_:. .. code-block:: c++. /// \returns true if the specified list has an element that is a foo.; static bool containsFoo(const std::vector<Bar*> &List) {; for (unsigned I = 0, E = List.size(); I != E; ++I); if (List[I]->isFoo()); return true;; return false;; }; ... if (containsFoo(BarList)) {; ...; }. There are many reasons for doing this: it reduces indentation and factors out; code which can often be shared by other code that checks for the same predicate.; More importantly, it *forces you to pick a name* for the function, and forces; you to write a comment for it. In this silly example, this doesn't add much; value. However, if the condition is complex, this can make it a lot easier for; the reader to understand the code that queries for this predicate. Instead of; being faced with the in-line details of how we check to see if the BarList; contains a foo, we can trust the function name and continue reading with better; locality.

Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");. You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program.

And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace. As such, it is; ok, and actually clearer, for the ``.cpp`` files to have a ``'using namespace; llvm;'`` directive at the top, after the ``#include``\s. This reduces; indentation in the body of the file for source editors that indent based on; braces, and keeps the conceptual context cleaner. The general form of this rule; is that any ``.cpp`` file that implements code in any namespace may use that; namespace (and its parents'), but should not use any others. Provide a Virtual Method Anchor for Classes in Headers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If a class is defined in a header file and has a vtable (either it has virtual; methods or it derives from classes with virtual methods), it must always have at; least one out-of-line virtual method in the class. Without this, the compiler; will copy the vtable and RTTI into every ``.o`` file that ``#include``\s the; header, bloating ``.o`` file sizes and increasing link times.

The problem with this construct is that it evaluates ""``BB->end()``"" every time; through the loop. Instead of writing the loop like this, we strongly prefer; loops to be written so that they evaluate it once before the loop starts. A; convenient way to do this is like so:. .. code-block:: c++. BasicBlock *BB = ...; for (auto I = BB->begin(), E = BB->end(); I != E; ++I); ... use I ... The observant may quickly point out that these two loops may have different; semantics: if the container (a basic block in this case) is being mutated, then; ""``BB->end()``"" may change its value every time through the loop and the second; loop may not in fact be correct. If you actually do depend on this behavior,; please write the loop in the first form and add a comment indicating that you; did it intentionally. Why do we prefer the second form (when correct)? Writing the loop in the first; form has two problems. First it may be less efficient than evaluating it at the; start of the loop. In this case, the cost is probably minor --- a few extra; loads every time through the loop. However, if the base expression is more; complex, then the cost can rise quickly. I've seen loops where the end; expression was actually something like: ""``SomeMap[X]->end()``"" and map lookups; really aren't cheap. By writing it in the second form consistently, you; eliminate the issue entirely and don't even have to think about it. The second (even bigger) issue is that writing the loop in the first form hints; to the reader that the loop is mutating the container (a fact that a comment; would handily confirm!). If you write the loop in the second form, it is; immediately obvious without even looking at the body of the loop that the; container isn't being modified, which makes it easier to read the code and; understand what it does.

While the second form of the loop is a few extra keystrokes, we do strongly; prefer it. ``#include <iostream>`` is Forbidden; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The use of ``#include <iostream>`` in library files is hereby **forbidden**,; because many common implementations transparently inject a `static constructor`_; into every translation unit that includes it. Note that using the other stream headers (``<sstream>`` for example) is not; problematic in this regard --- just ``<iostream>``. However, ``raw_ostream``; provides various APIs that are better performing for almost every use than; ``std::ostream`` style APIs. .. note::. New code should always use `raw_ostream`_ for writing, or the; ``llvm::MemoryBuffer`` API for reading files. .. _raw_ostream:. Use ``raw_ostream``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM includes a lightweight, simple, and efficient stream implementation in; ``llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h``, which provides all of the common features of; ``std::ostream``. All new code should use ``raw_ostream`` instead of; ``ostream``. Unlike ``std::ostream``, ``raw_ostream`` is not a template and can be forward; declared as ``class raw_ostream``. Public headers should generally not include; the ``raw_ostream`` header, but use forward declarations and constant references; to ``raw_ostream`` instances. Avoid ``std::endl``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``std::endl`` modifier, when used with ``iostreams`` outputs a newline to; the output stream specified. In addition to doing this, however, it also; flushes the output stream. In other words, these are equivalent:. .. code-block:: c++. std::cout << std::endl;; std::cout << '\n' << std::flush;. Most of the time, you probably have no reason to flush the output stream, so; it's better to use a literal ``'\n'``.

A = foo(42, 92) + bar(X);. The reason for doing this is not completely arbitrary. This style makes control; flow operators stand out more, and makes expressions flow better. Prefer Preincrement; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Hard fast rule: Preincrement (``++X``) may be no slower than postincrement; (``X++``) and could very well be a lot faster than it. Use preincrementation; whenever possible. The semantics of postincrement include making a copy of the value being; incremented, returning it, and then preincrementing the ""work value"". For; primitive types, this isn't a big deal. But for iterators, it can be a huge; issue (for example, some iterators contains stack and set objects in them...; copying an iterator could invoke the copy ctor's of these as well). In general,; get in the habit of always using preincrement, and you won't have a problem. Namespace Indentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, we strive to reduce indentation wherever possible. This is useful; because we want code to `fit into 80 columns`_ without excessive wrapping, but; also because it makes it easier to understand the code. To facilitate this and; avoid some insanely deep nesting on occasion, don't indent namespaces. If it; helps readability, feel free to add a comment indicating what namespace is; being closed by a ``}``. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; namespace knowledge {. /// This class represents things that Smith can have an intimate; /// understanding of and contains the data associated with it.; class Grokable {; ...; public:; explicit Grokable() { ... }; virtual ~Grokable() = 0;. ... };. } // namespace knowledge; } // namespace llvm.

But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper() {; ...; }. bool StringSort::operator<(const char *RHS) const {; ...; }. Avoid putting declarations other than classes into anonymous namespaces:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {. // ... many declarations ... void runHelper() {; ...; }. // ... many declarations ... } // namespace. When you are looking at ""``runHelper``"" in the middle of a large C++ file,; you have no immediate way to tell if this function is local to the file.

C++ Standard Library; --------------------. Instead of implementing custom data structures, we encourage the use of C++; standard library facilities or LLVM support libraries whenever they are; available for a particular task. LLVM and related projects emphasize and rely; on the standard library facilities and the LLVM support libraries as much as; possible. LLVM support libraries (for example, `ADT; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT>`_); implement specialized data structures or functionality missing in the standard; library. Such libraries are usually implemented in the ``llvm`` namespace and; follow the expected standard interface, when there is one. When both C++ and the LLVM support libraries provide similar functionality, and; there isn't a specific reason to favor the C++ implementation, it is generally; preferable to use the LLVM library. For example, ``llvm::DenseMap`` should; almost always be used instead of ``std::map`` or ``std::unordered_map``, and; ``llvm::SmallVector`` should usually be used instead of ``std::vector``. We explicitly avoid some standard facilities, like the I/O streams, and instead; use LLVM's streams library (raw_ostream_). More detailed information on these; subjects is available in the :doc:`ProgrammersManual`. For more information about LLVM's data structures and the tradeoffs they make,; please consult `that section of the programmer's manual; <https://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#picking-the-right-data-structure-for-a-task>`_.

To refer to parameter names inside a paragraph, use the ``\p name`` command.; Don't use the ``\arg name`` command since it starts a new paragraph that; contains documentation for the parameter. Wrap non-inline code examples in ``\code ... \endcode``. To document a function parameter, start a new paragraph with the; ``\param name`` command. If the parameter is used as an out or an in/out; parameter, use the ``\param [out] name`` or ``\param [in,out] name`` command,; respectively.

Language and Compiler Issues; ----------------------------. Treat Compiler Warnings Like Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Compiler warnings are often useful and help improve the code. Those that are; not useful, can be often suppressed with a small code change. For example, an; assignment in the ``if`` condition is often a typo:. .. code-block:: c++. if (V = getValue()) {; ...; }. Several compilers will print a warning for the code above. It can be suppressed; by adding parentheses:. .. code-block:: c++. if ((V = getValue())) {; ...; }. Write Portable Code; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In almost all cases, it is possible to write completely portable code. When; you need to rely on non-portable code, put it behind a well-defined and; well-documented interface. Do not use RTTI or Exceptions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In an effort to reduce code and executable size, LLVM does not use exceptions; or RTTI (`runtime type information; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information>`_, for example,; ``dynamic_cast<>``). That said, LLVM does make extensive use of a hand-rolled form of RTTI that use; templates like :ref:`isa\<>, cast\<>, and dyn_cast\<> <isa>`.; This form of RTTI is opt-in and can be; :doc:`added to any class <HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI>`. Prefer C++-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When casting, use ``static_cast``, ``reinterpret_cast``, and ``const_cast``,; rather than C-style casts. There are two exceptions to this:. * When casting to ``void`` to suppress warnings about unused variables (as an; alternative to ``[[maybe_unused]]``). Prefer C-style casts in this instance. * When casting between integral types (including enums that are not strongly-; typed), functi",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

In general, there is no relative ordering among pointers. As a result,; when unordered containers like sets and maps are used with pointer keys; the iteration order is undefined. Hence, iterating such containers may; result in non-deterministic code generation. While the generated code; might work correctly, non-determinism can make it harder to reproduce bugs and; debug the compiler. In case an ordered result is expected, remember to; sort an unordered container before iteration. Or use ordered containers; like ``vector``/``MapVector``/``SetVector`` if you want to iterate pointer; keys. Beware of non-deterministic sorting order of equal elements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``std::sort`` uses a non-stable sorting algorithm in which the order of equal; elements is not guaranteed to be preserved. Thus using ``std::sort`` for a; container having equal elements may result in non-deterministic behavior.; To uncover such instances of non-determinism, LLVM has introduced a new; llvm::sort wrapper function. For an EXPENSIVE_CHECKS build this will randomly; shuffle the container before sorting. Default to using ``llvm::sort`` instead; of ``std::sort``. Style Issues; ============.

This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``).

One common mistake is to; write a loop in this style:. .. code-block:: c++. BasicBlock *BB = ...; for (auto I = BB->begin(); I != BB->end(); ++I); ... use I ... The problem with this construct is that it evaluates ""``BB->end()``"" every time; through the loop. Instead of writing the loop like this, we strongly prefer; loops to be written so that they evaluate it once before the loop starts. A; convenient way to do this is like so:. .. code-block:: c++. BasicBlock *BB = ...; for (auto I = BB->begin(), E = BB->end(); I != E; ++I); ... use I ... The observant may quickly point out that these two loops may have different; semantics: if the container (a basic block in this case) is being mutated, then; ""``BB->end()``"" may change its value every time through the loop and the second; loop may not in fact be correct. If you actually do depend on this behavior,; please write the loop in the first form and add a comment indicating that you; did it intentionally. Why do we prefer the second form (when correct)? Writing the loop in the first; form has two problems. First it may be less efficient than evaluating it at the; start of the loop. In this case, the cost is probably minor --- a few extra; loads every time through the loop. However, if the base expression is more; complex, then the cost can rise quickly. I've seen loops where the end; expression was actually something like: ""``SomeMap[X]->end()``"" and map lookups; really aren't cheap. By writing it in the second form consistently, you; eliminate the issue entirely and don't even have to think about it.

The use of ``#include <iostream>`` in library files is hereby **forbidden**,; because many common implementations transparently inject a `static constructor`_; into every translation unit that includes it. Note that using the other stream headers (``<sstream>`` for example) is not; problematic in this regard --- just ``<iostream>``. However, ``raw_ostream``; provides various APIs that are better performing for almost every use than; ``std::ostream`` style APIs. .. note::. New code should always use `raw_ostream`_ for writing, or the; ``llvm::MemoryBuffer`` API for reading files. .. _raw_ostream:. Use ``raw_ostream``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM includes a lightweight, simple, and efficient stream implementation in; ``llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h``, which provides all of the common features of; ``std::ostream``. All new code should use ``raw_ostream`` instead of; ``ostream``. Unlike ``std::ostream``, ``raw_ostream`` is not a template and can be forward; declared as ``class raw_ostream``.

This style makes control; flow operators stand out more, and makes expressions flow better. Prefer Preincrement; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Hard fast rule: Preincrement (``++X``) may be no slower than postincrement; (``X++``) and could very well be a lot faster than it. Use preincrementation; whenever possible. The semantics of postincrement include making a copy of the value being; incremented, returning it, and then preincrementing the ""work value"". For; primitive types, this isn't a big deal. But for iterators, it can be a huge; issue (for example, some iterators contains stack and set objects in them...; copying an iterator could invoke the copy ctor's of these as well). In general,; get in the habit of always using preincrement, and you won't have a problem. Namespace Indentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, we strive to reduce indentation wherever possible. This is useful; because we want code to `fit into 80 columns`_ without excessive wrapping, but; also because it makes it easier to understand the code. To facilitate this and; avoid some insanely deep nesting on occasion, don't indent namespaces. If it; helps readability, feel free to add a comment indicating what namespace is; being closed by a ``}``. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; namespace knowledge {. /// This class represents things that Smith can have an intimate; /// understanding of and contains the data associated with it.; class Grokable {; ...; public:; explicit Grokable() { ... }; virtual ~Grokable() = 0;. ... };. } // namespace knowledge; } // namespace llvm. Feel free to skip the closing comment when the namespace being closed is; obvious for any reason. For example, the outer-most namespace in a header file; is rarely a source of confusion.

Mechanical Source Issues; ========================. Source Code Formatting; ----------------------. Commenting; ^^^^^^^^^^. Comments are important for readability and maintainability. When writing comments,; write them as English prose, using proper capitalization, punctuation, etc.; Aim to describe what the code is trying to do and why, not *how* it does it at; a micro level. Here are a few important things to document:. .. _header file comment:. File Headers; """""""""""""""""""""""". Every source file should have a header on it that describes the basic purpose of; the file. The standard header looks like this:. .. code-block:: c++. //===-- llvm/Instruction.h - Instruction class definition -------*- C++ -*-===//; //; // Part of the LLVM Project, under the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions.; // See https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt for license information.; // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception; //; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; ///; /// \file; /// This file contains the declaration of the Instruction class, which is the; /// base class for all of the VM instructions.; ///",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

This rule; applies to all LLVM subprojects. .. _fit into 80 columns:. Source Code Width; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Write your code to fit within 80 columns. There must be some limit to the width of the code in; order to allow developers to have multiple files side-by-side in; windows on a modest display. If you are going to pick a width limit, it is; somewhat arbitrary but you might as well pick something standard. Going with 90; columns (for example) instead of 80 columns wouldn't add any significant value; and would be detrimental to printing out code. Also many other projects have; standardized on 80 columns, so some people have already configured their editors; for it (vs something else, like 90 columns). Whitespace; ^^^^^^^^^^. In all cases, prefer spaces to tabs in source files. People have different; preferred indentation levels, and different styles of indentation that they; like; this is fine. What isn't fine is that different editors/viewers expand; tabs out to different tab stops. This can cause your code to look completely; unreadable, and it is not worth dealing with. As always, follow the `Golden Rule`_ above: follow the style of existing code; if you are modifying and extending it. Do not add trailing whitespace. Some common editors will automatically remove; trailing whitespace when saving a file which causes unrelated changes to appear; in diffs and commits. Format Lambdas Like Blocks Of Code; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". When formatting a multi-line lambda, format it like a block of code.

To take best advantage of this formatting, if you are designing an API which; accepts a continuation or single callable argument (be it a function object, or; a ``std::function``), it should be the last argument if at all possible.

Similarly, if you need; to explicitly name the type and call its constructor to create a temporary,; don't use a braced initializer list. Instead, use a braced initializer list; (without any type for temporaries) when doing aggregate initialization or; something notionally equivalent. Examples:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; public:; // Construct a Foo by reading data from the disk in the whizbang format, ...; Foo(std::string filename);. // Construct a Foo by looking up the Nth element of some global data ...; Foo(int N);. // ...; };. // The Foo constructor call is reading a file, don't use braces to call it.; std::fill(foo.begin(), foo.end(), Foo(""name""));. // The pair is being constructed like an aggregate, use braces.; bar_map.insert({my_key, my_value});.

Use ``auto`` Type Deduction to Make Code More Readable; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some are advocating a policy of ""almost always ``auto``"" in C++11, however LLVM; uses a more moderate stance. Use ``auto`` if and only if it makes the code more; readable or easier to maintain. Don't ""almost always"" use ``auto``, but do use; ``auto`` with initializers like ``cast<Foo>(...)`` or other places where the; type is already obvious from the context. Another time when ``auto`` works well; for these purposes is when the type would have been abstracted away anyways,; often behind a container's typedef such as ``std::vector<T>::iterator``.

Beware of non-deterministic sorting order of equal elements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``std::sort`` uses a non-stable sorting algorithm in which the order of equal; elements is not guaranteed to be preserved. Thus using ``std::sort`` for a; container having equal elements may result in non-deterministic behavior.; To uncover such instances of non-determinism, LLVM has introduced a new; llvm::sort wrapper function. For an EXPENSIVE_CHECKS build this will randomly; shuffle the container before sorting. Default to using ``llvm::sort`` instead; of ``std::sort``. Style Issues; ============. The High-Level Issues; ---------------------. Self-contained Headers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and end in ``.h``.; Non-header files that are meant for inclusion should end in ``.inc`` and be; used sparingly. All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring tools should; not have to adhere to special conditions to include the header. Specifically, a; header should have header guards and include all other headers it needs. There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not; self-contained. These are typically intended to be included at unusual; locations, such as the middle of another file. They might not use header; guards, and might not include their prerequisites. Name such files with the; .inc extension. Use sparingly, and prefer self-contained headers when possible. In general, a header should be implemented by one or more ``.cpp`` files. Each; of these ``.cpp`` files should include the header that defines their interface; first. This ensures that all of the dependences of the header have been; properly added to the header itself, and are not implicit. System headers; should be included after user headers for a translation unit. Library Layering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

In these cases go ahead and ``#include`` that header file. Be; aware however that there are many cases where you don't need to have the full; definition of a class. If you are using a pointer or reference to a class, you; don't need the header file. If you are simply returning a class instance from a; prototyped function or method, you don't need it. In fact, for most cases, you; simply don't need the definition of a class. And not ``#include``\ing speeds up; compilation. It is easy to try to go too overboard on this recommendation, however. You; **must** include all of the header files that you are using --- you can include; them either directly or indirectly through another header file.

Different kinds of declarations have different rules:. * **Type names** (including classes, structs, enums, typedefs, etc) should be; nouns and start with an upper-case letter (e.g. ``TextFileReader``). * **Variable names** should be nouns (as they represent state). The name should; be camel case, and start with an upper case letter (e.g. ``Leader`` or; ``Boats``). * **Function names** should be verb phrases (as they represent actions), and; command-like function should be imperative. The name should be camel case,; and start with a lower case letter (e.g. ``openFile()`` or ``isFoo()``). * **Enum declarations** (e.g. ``enum Foo {...}``) are types, so they should; follow the naming conventions for types. A common use for enums is as a; discriminator for a union, or an indicator of a subclass. When an enum is; used for something like this, it should have a ``Kind`` suffix; (e.g. ``ValueKind``). * **Enumerators** (e.g. ``enum { Foo, Bar }``) and **public member variables**; should start with an upper-case letter, just like types. Unless the; enumerators are defined in their own small namespace or inside a class,; enumerators should have a prefix corresponding to the enum declaration name.; For example, ``enum ValueKind { ... };`` may contain enumerators like; ``VK_Argument``, ``VK_BasicBlock``, etc. Enumerators that are just; convenience constants are exempt from the requirement for a prefix. For; instance:. .. code-block:: c++. enum {; MaxSize = 42,; Density = 12; };. As an exception, classes that mimic STL classes can have member names in STL's; style of lower-case words separated by underscores (e.g. ``begin()``,; ``push_back()``, and ``empty()``). Classes that provide multiple; iterators should add a singular prefix to ``begin()`` and ``end()``; (e.g. ``global_begin()`` and ``use_begin()``).

But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper() {; ...; }. bool StringSort::operator<(const char *RHS) const {; ...; }.

Avoid putting declarations other than classes into anonymous namespaces:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {. // ... many declarations ... void runHelper() {; ...; }. // ... many declarations ... } // namespace. When you are looking at ""``runHelper``"" in the middle of a large C++ file,; you have no immediate way to tell if this function is local to the file. In; contrast, when the function is marked static, you don't need to cross-reference; faraway places in the file to tell that the function is local. Don't Use Braces on Simple Single-Statement Bodies of if/else/loop Statements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When writing the body of an ``if``, ``else``, or for/while loop statement, we; prefer to omit the braces to avoid unnecessary line noise. However, braces; should be used in cases where the omission of braces harm the readability and; maintainability of the code. We consider that readability is harmed when omitting the brace in the presence; of a single statement that is accompanied by a comment (assuming the comment; can't be hoisted above the ``if`` or loop statement, see below). Similarly, braces should be used when a single-statement body is complex enough; that it becomes difficult to see where the block containing the following; statement began. An ``if``/``else`` chain or a loop is considered a single; statement for this rule, and this rule applies recursively. This list is not exhaustive. For example, readability is also harmed if an; ``if``/``else`` chain does not use braced bodies for either all or none of its; members, or has complex conditionals, deep nesting, etc. The examples below; intend to provide some guidelines. Maintainability is harmed if the body of an ``if`` ends with a (directly or; indirectly) nested ``if`` statement with no ``else``.

Instead of writing the loop like this, we strongly prefer; loops to be written so that they evaluate it once before the loop starts. A; convenient way to do this is like so:. .. code-block:: c++. BasicBlock *BB = ...; for (auto I = BB->begin(), E = BB->end(); I != E; ++I); ... use I ... The observant may quickly point out that these two loops may have different; semantics: if the container (a basic block in this case) is being mutated, then; ""``BB->end()``"" may change its value every time through the loop and the second; loop may not in fact be correct. If you actually do depend on this behavior,; please write the loop in the first form and add a comment indicating that you; did it intentionally. Why do we prefer the second form (when correct)? Writing the loop in the first; form has two problems. First it may be less efficient than evaluating it at the; start of the loop. In this case, the cost is probably minor --- a few extra; loads every time through the loop. However, if the base expression is more; complex, then the cost can rise quickly. I've seen loops where the end; expression was actually something like: ""``SomeMap[X]->end()``"" and map lookups; really aren't cheap.

The use of ``#include <iostream>`` in library files is hereby **forbidden**,; because many common implementations transparently inject a `static constructor`_; into every translation unit that includes it. Note that using the other stream headers (``<sstream>`` for example) is not; problematic in this regard --- just ``<iostream>``. However, ``raw_ostream``; provides various APIs that are better performing for almost every use than; ``std::ostream`` style APIs. .. note::. New code should always use `raw_ostream`_ for writing, or the; ``llvm::MemoryBuffer`` API for reading files. .. _raw_ostream:. Use ``raw_ostream``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM includes a lightweight, simple, and efficient stream implementation in; ``llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h``, which provides all of the common features of; ``std::ostream``. All new code should use ``raw_ostream`` instead of; ``ostream``. Unlike ``std::ostream``, ``raw_ostream`` is not a template and can be forward; declared as ``class raw_ostream``. Public headers should generally not include; the ``raw_ostream`` header, but use forward declarations and constant references; to ``raw_ostream`` instances. Avoid ``std::endl``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Feel free to skip the closing comment when the namespace being closed is; obvious for any reason. For example, the outer-most namespace in a header file; is rarely a source of confusion. But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper(",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

Please commit such changes separately to; make code review easier. The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to increase the readability and; maintainability of our common source base. Languages, Libraries, and Standards; ===================================. Most source code in LLVM and other LLVM projects using these coding standards; is C++ code. There are some places where C code is used either due to; environment restrictions, historical restrictions, or due to third-party source; code imported into the tree. Generally, our preference is for standards; conforming, modern, and portable C++ code as the implementation language of; choice. For automation, build-systems and utility scripts Python is preferred and; is widely used in the LLVM repository already. C++ Standard Versions; ---------------------. Unless otherwise documented, LLVM subprojects are written using standard C++17; code and avoid unnecessary vendor-specific extensions. Nevertheless, we restrict ourselves to features which are available in the; major toolchains supported as host compilers (see :doc:`GettingStarted` page,; section `Software`). Each toolchain provides a good reference for what it accepts:. * Clang: https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html. * libc++: https://libcxx.llvm.org/Status/Cxx17.html. * GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17. * libstdc++: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#status.iso.2017. * MSVC: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx. C++ Standard Library; --------------------.

LLVM and related projects emphasize and rely; on the standard library facilities and the LLVM support libraries as much as; possible. LLVM support libraries (for example, `ADT; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT>`_); implement specialized data structures or functionality missing in the standard; library. Such libraries are usually implemented in the ``llvm`` namespace and; follow the expected standard interface, when there is one. When both C++ and the LLVM support libraries provide similar functionality, and; there isn't a specific reason to favor the C++ implementation, it is generally; preferable to use the LLVM library. For example, ``llvm::DenseMap`` should; almost always be used instead of ``std::map`` or ``std::unordered_map``, and; ``llvm::SmallVector`` should usually be used instead of ``std::vector``. We explicitly avoid some standard facilities, like the I/O streams, and instead; use LLVM's streams library (raw_ostream_).

The historically common formatting of braced initialization of aggregate; variables does not mix cleanly with deep nesting, general expression contexts,; function arguments, and lambdas. We suggest new code use a simple rule for; formatting braced initialization lists: act as-if the braces were parentheses; in a function call.

Several compilers will print a warning for the code above. It can be suppressed; by adding parentheses:. .. code-block:: c++. if ((V = getValue())) {; ...; }.

If you really need to do something like this, put a private header file in the; same directory as the source files, and include it locally. This ensures that; your private interface remains private and undisturbed by outsiders. .. note::. It's okay to put extra implementation methods in a public class itself. Just; make them private (or protected) and all is well. Use Namespace Qualifiers to Implement Previously Declared Functions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When providing an out of line implementation of a function in a source file, do; not open namespace blocks in the source file. Instead, use namespace qualifiers; to help ensure that your definition matches an existing declaration. Do this:. .. code-block:: c++. // Foo.h; namespace llvm {; int foo(const char *s);; }. // Foo.cpp; #include ""Foo.h""; using namespace llvm;; int llvm::foo(const char *s) {; // ...; }. Doing this helps to avoid bugs where the definition does not match the; declaration from the header. For example, the following C++ code defines a new; overload of ``llvm::foo`` instead of providing a definition for the existing; function declared in the header:. .. code-block:: c++. // Foo.cpp; #include ""Foo.h""; namespace llvm {; int foo(char *s) { // Mismatch between ""const char *"" and ""char *""; }; } // namespace llvm. This error will not be caught until the build is nearly complete, when the; linker fails to find a definition for any uses of the original function. If the; function were instead defined with a namespace qualifier, the error would have; been caught immediately when the definition was compiled. Class method implementations must already name the class and new overloads; cannot be introduced out of line, so this recommendation does not apply to them. .. _early exits:.

This code has several problems if the body of the ``'if'`` is large. When; you're looking at the top of the function, it isn't immediately clear that this; *only* does interesting things with non-terminator instructions, and only; applies to things with the other predicates. Second, it is relatively difficult; to describe (in comments) why these predicates are important because the ``if``; statement makes it difficult to lay out the comments. Third, when you're deep; within the body of the code, it is indented an extra level. Finally, when; reading the top of the function, it isn't clear what the result is if the; predicate isn't true; you have to read to the end of the function to know that; it returns null. It is much preferred to format the code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *doSomething(Instruction *I) {; // Terminators never need 'something' done to them because ...; if (I->isTerminator()); return 0;. // We conservatively avoid transforming instructions with multiple uses; // because goats like cheese.; if (!I->hasOneUse()); return 0;. // This is really just here for example.; if (!doOtherThing(I)); return 0;. ... some long code ....; }. This fixes these problems. A similar problem frequently happens in ``for``; loops.

You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");.

Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead.

These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not.

If a class is defined in a header file and has a vtable (either it has virtual; methods or it derives from classes with virtual methods), it must always have at; least one out-of-line virtual method in the class.

Don't use default labels in fully covered switches over enumerations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``-Wswitch`` warns if a switch, without a default label, over an enumeration; does not cover every enumeration value. If you write a default label on a fully; covered switch over an enumeration then the ``-Wswitch`` warning won't fire; when new elements are added to that enumeration. To help avoid adding these; kinds of defaults, Clang has the warning ``-Wcovered-switch-default`` which is; off by default but turned on when building LLVM with a version of Clang that; supports the warning. A knock-on effect of this stylistic requirement is that when building LLVM with; GCC you may get warnings related to ""control may reach end of non-void function""; if you return from each case of a covered switch-over-enum because GCC assumes; that the enum expression may take any representable value, not just those of; individual enumerators.

Hard fast rule: Preincrement (``++X``) may be no slower than postincrement; (``X++``) and could very well be a lot faster than it. Use preincrementation; whenever possible. The semantics of postincrement include making a copy of the value being; incremented, returning it, and then preincrementing the ""work value"". For; primitive types, this isn't a big deal. But for iterators, it can be a huge; issue (for example, some iterators contains stack and set objects in them...; copying an iterator could invoke the copy ctor's of these as well). In general,; get in the habit of always using preincrement, and you won't have a problem. Namespace Indentation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, we strive to reduce indentation wherever possible. This is useful; because we want code to `fit into 80 columns`_ without excessive wrapping, but; also because it makes it easier to understand the code. To facilitate this and; avoid some insanely deep nesting on occasion, don't indent namespaces. If it; helps readability, feel free to add a comment indicating what namespace is; being closed by a ``}``. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; namespace knowledge {. /// This class represents things that Smith can have an intimate; /// understanding of and contains the data associated with it.; class Grokable {; ...; public:; explicit Grokable() { ... }; virtual ~Grokable() = 0;. ... };. } // namespace knowledge; } // namespace llvm. Feel free to skip the closing comment when the namespace being closed is; obvious for any reason. For example, the outer-most namespace in a header file; is rarely a source of confusion. But namespaces both anonymous and named in; source files that are being closed half way through the file probably could use; clarification. .. _static:. Anonymous Namespaces; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Do Not Use ``using namespace std``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"". In header files, adding a ``'using namespace XXX'`` directive pollutes the; namespace of any source file that ``#include``\s the header, creating; maintenance issues. In implementation files (e.g. ``.cpp`` files), the rule is more of a stylistic; rule, but is still important. Basically, using explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace. As such, it is; ok, and actually clearer, for the ``.cpp`` files to have a ``'using namespace; llvm;'`` directive at the top, after the ``#include``\s. This reduces; indentation in the body of the file for source editors that indent based on; braces, and keeps the conceptual context cleaner. The general form of this rule; is that any ``.cpp`` file that implements code in any namespace may use that; namespace (and its parents'), but should not use any others.

I've seen loops where the end; expression was actually something like: ""``SomeMap[X]->end()``"" and map lookups; really aren't cheap. By writing it in the second form consistently, you; eliminate the issue entirely and don't even have to think about it. The second (even bigger) issue is that writing the loop in the first form hints; to the reader that the loop is mutating the container (a fact that a comment; would handily confirm!). If you write the loop in the second form, it is; immediately obvious without even looking at the body of the loop that the; container isn't being modified, which makes it easier to read the code and; understand what it does. While the second form of the loop is a few extra keystrokes, we do strongly; prefer it. ``#include <iostream>`` is Forbidden; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The use of ``#include <iostream>`` in library files is hereby **forbidden**,; because many common implementations transparently inject a `static constructor`_; into every translation unit that includes it.

Hard fast rule: Preincrement (``++X``) may be no slower than postincrement; (``X++``) and could very well be a lot faster than it. Use preincrementation; whenever possible. The semantics of postincrement include making a copy of the value being; incremented, returning it, and then preincrementing the ""work value"". For; primitive types, this isn't a big deal. But for iterators, it can be a huge; issue (for example, some iterators contains stack and set objects in them...; copying an iterator could invoke the copy ctor's of these as well).

Most source code in LLVM and other LLVM projects using these coding standards; is C++ code. There are some places where C code is used either due to; environment restrictions, historical restrictions, or due to third-party source; code imported into the tree. Generally, our preference is for standards; conforming, modern, and portable C++ code as the implementation language of; choice. For automation, build-systems and utility scripts Python is preferred and; is widely used in the LLVM repository already. C++ Standard Versions; ---------------------. Unless otherwise documented, LLVM subprojects are written using standard C++17; code and avoid unnecessary vendor-specific extensions. Nevertheless, we restrict ourselves to features which are available in the; major toolchains supported as host compilers (see :doc:`GettingStarted` page,; section `Software`).",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

For example, ``llvm::DenseMap`` should; almost always be used instead of ``std::map`` or ``std::unordered_map``, and; ``llvm::SmallVector`` should usually be used instead of ``std::vector``. We explicitly avoid some standard facilities, like the I/O streams, and instead; use LLVM's streams library (raw_ostream_). More detailed information on these; subjects is available in the :doc:`ProgrammersManual`. For more information about LLVM's data structures and the tradeoffs they make,; please consult `that section of the programmer's manual; <https://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#picking-the-right-data-structure-for-a-task>`_. Python version and Source Code Formatting; -----------------------------------------. The current minimum version of Python required is documented in the :doc:`GettingStarted`; section. Python code in the LLVM repository should only use language features; available in this version of Python. The Python code within the LLVM repository should adhere to the formatting guidelines; outlined in `PEP 8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_. For consistency and to limit churn, code should be automatically formatted with; the `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ utility, which is PEP 8 compliant.; Use its default rules. For example, avoid specifying ``--line-length`` even; though it does not default to 80. The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker.

Good things to talk about here are what happens when something unexpected; happens, for instance, does the method return null?. Comment Formatting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, prefer C++-style comments (``//`` for normal comments, ``///`` for; ``doxygen`` documentation comments). There are a few cases when it is; useful to use C-style (``/* */``) comments however:. #. When writing C code to be compatible with C89. #. When writing a header file that may be ``#include``\d by a C source file. #. When writing a source file that is used by a tool that only accepts C-style; comments. #. When documenting the significance of constants used as actual parameters in; a call. This is most helpful for ``bool`` parameters, or passing ``0`` or; ``nullptr``. The comment should contain the parameter name, which ought to be; meaningful. For example, it's not clear what the parameter means in this call:. .. code-block:: c++. Object.emitName(nullptr);. An in-line C-style comment makes the intent obvious:. .. code-block:: c++. Object.emitName(/*Prefix=*/nullptr);. Commenting out large blocks of code is discouraged, but if you really have to do; this (for documentation purposes or as a suggestion for debug printing), use; ``#if 0`` and ``#endif``. These nest properly and are better behaved in general; than C style comments. Doxygen Use in Documentation Comments; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Use the ``\file`` command to turn the standard file header into a file-level; comment. Include descriptive paragraphs for all public interfaces (public classes,; member and non-member functions). Avoid restating the information that can; be inferred from the API name. The first sentence (or a paragraph beginning; with ``\brief``) is used as an abstract.

This is a bad message, since it does not provide useful information and uses the; wrong style:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: Corrupt section header. As with other coding standards, individual projects, such as the Clang Static; Analyzer, may have preexisting styles that do not conform to this. If a; different formatting scheme is used consistently throughout the project, use; that style instead. Otherwise, this standard applies to all LLVM tools,; including clang, clang-tidy, and so on. If the tool or project does not have existing functions to emit warnings or; errors, use the error and warning handlers provided in ``Support/WithColor.h``; to ensure they are printed in the appropriate style, rather than printing to; stderr directly. When using ``report_fatal_error``, follow the same standards for the message as; regular error messages.

We prefer these ``#include``\s to be listed in this order:. .. _Main Module Header:; .. _Local/Private Headers:. #. Main Module Header; #. Local/Private Headers; #. LLVM project/subproject headers (``clang/...``, ``lldb/...``, ``llvm/...``, etc); #. System ``#include``\s. and each category should be sorted lexicographically by the full path.

Braced Initializer Lists; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Starting from C++11, there are significantly more uses of braced lists to; perform initialization. For example, they can be used to construct aggregate; temporaries in expressions. They now have a natural way of ending up nested; within each other and within function calls in order to build up aggregates; (such as option structs) from local variables. The historically common formatting of braced initialization of aggregate; variables does not mix cleanly with deep nesting, general expression contexts,; function arguments, and lambdas. We suggest new code use a simple rule for; formatting braced initialization lists: act as-if the braces were parentheses; in a function call. The formatting rules exactly match those already well; understood for formatting nested function calls. Examples:. .. code-block:: c++. foo({a, b, c}, {1, 2, 3});. llvm::Constant *Mask[] = {; llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 0),; llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 1),; llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 2)};. This formatting scheme also makes it particularly easy to get predictable,; consistent, and automatic formatting with tools like `Clang Format`_. .. _Clang Format: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html. Language and Compiler Issues; ----------------------------. Treat Compiler Warnings Like Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Compiler warnings are often useful and help improve the code.

Another time when ``auto`` works well; for these purposes is when the type would have been abstracted away anyways,; often behind a container's typedef such as ``std::vector<T>::iterator``. Similarly, C++14 adds generic lambda expressions where parameter types can be; ``auto``. Use these where you would have used a template. Beware unnecessary copies with ``auto``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The convenience of ``auto`` makes it easy to forget that its default behavior; is a copy. Particularly in range-based ``for`` loops, careless copies are; expensive. Use ``auto &`` for values and ``auto *`` for pointers unless you need to make a; copy. .. code-block:: c++. // Typically there's no reason to copy.; for (const auto &Val : Container) observe(Val);; for (auto &Val : Container) Val.change();. // Remove the reference if you really want a new copy.; for (auto Val : Container) { Val.change(); saveSomewhere(Val); }. // Copy pointers, but make it clear that they're pointers.; for (const auto *Ptr : Container) observe(*Ptr);; for (auto *Ptr : Container) Ptr->change();. Beware of non-determinism due to ordering of pointers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, there is no relative ordering among pointers. As a result,; when unordered containers like sets and maps are used with pointer keys; the iteration order is undefined. Hence, iterating such containers may; result in non-deterministic code generation. While the generated code; might work correctly, non-determinism can make it harder to reproduce bugs and; debug the compiler. In case an ordered result is expected, remember to; sort an unordered container before iteration. Or use ordered containers; like ``vector``/``MapVector``/``SetVector`` if you want to iterate pointer; keys. Beware of non-deterministic sorting order of equal elements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``std::sort`` uses a non-stable sorting algorith",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst

Do Not Use ``using namespace std``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"". In header files, adding a ``'using namespace XXX'`` directive pollutes the; namespace of any source file that ``#include``\s the header, creating; maintenance issues. In implementation files (e.g. ``.cpp`` files), the rule is more of a stylistic; rule, but is still important. Basically, using explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace. As such, it is; ok, and actually clearer, for the ``.cpp`` files to have a ``'using namespace; llvm;'`` directive at the top, after the ``#include``\s.

Provide a Virtual Method Anchor for Classes in Headers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If a class is defined in a header file and has a vtable (either it has virtual; methods or it derives from classes with virtual methods), it must always have at; least one out-of-line virtual method in the class.

While the second form of the loop is a few extra keystrokes, we do strongly; prefer it. ``#include <iostream>`` is Forbidden; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The use of ``#include <iostream>`` in library files is hereby **forbidden**,; because many common implementations transparently inject a `static constructor`_; into every translation unit that includes it. Note that using the other stream headers (``<sstream>`` for example) is not; problematic in this regard --- just ``<iostream>``. However, ``raw_ostream``; provides various APIs that are better performing for almost every use than; ``std::ostream`` style APIs. .. note::. New code should always use `raw_ostream`_ for writing, or the; ``llvm::MemoryBuffer`` API for reading files. .. _raw_ostream:. Use ``raw_ostream``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM includes a lightweight, simple, and efficient stream implementation in; ``llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h``, which provides all of the common features of; ``std::ostream``. All new code should use ``raw_ostream`` instead of; ``ostream``. Unlike ``std::ostream``, ``raw_ostream`` is not a template and can be forward; declared as ``class raw_ostream``. Public headers should generally not include; the ``raw_ostream`` header, but use forward declarations and constant references; to ``raw_ostream`` instances. Avoid ``std::endl``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``std::endl`` modifier, when used with ``iostreams`` outputs a newline to; the output stream specified. In addition to doing this, however, it also; flushes the output stream. In other words, these are equivalent:. .. code-block:: c++. std::cout << std::endl;; std::cout << '\n' << std::flush;.

Microscopic Details; -------------------. This section describes preferred low-level formatting guidelines along with; reasoning on why we prefer them. Spaces Before Parentheses; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Put a space before an open parenthesis only in control flow statements, but not; in normal function call expressions and function-like macros. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. if (X) ...; for (I = 0; I != 100; ++I) ...; while (LLVMRocks) ... somefunc(42);; assert(3 != 4 && ""laws of math are failing me"");. A = foo(42, 92) + bar(X);. The reason for doing this is not completely arbitrary. This style makes control; flow operators stand out more, and makes expressions flow better. Prefer Preincrement; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Hard fast rule: Preincrement (``++X``) may be no slower than postincrement; (``X++``) and could very well be a lot faster than it. Use preincrementation; whenever possible. The semantics of postincrement include making a copy of the value being; incremented, returning it, and then preincrementing the ""work value"". For; primitive types, this isn't a big deal.

Although there are a **lot** of command line argument parsing libraries out; there in many different languages, none of them fit well with what I needed.

Speed: The CommandLine library is very quick and uses little resources. The; parsing time of the library is directly proportional to the number of; arguments parsed, not the number of options recognized. Additionally,; command line argument values are captured transparently into user defined; global variables, which can be accessed like any other variable (and with the; same performance). #.

No subclasses required: To use CommandLine, you instantiate variables that; correspond to the arguments that you would like to capture, you don't; subclass a parser. This means that you don't have to write **any**; boilerplate code. #. Globally accessible: Libraries can specify command line arguments that are; automatically enabled in any tool that links to the library. This is; possible because the application doesn't have to keep a list of arguments to; pass to the parser. This also makes supporting `dynamically loaded options`_; trivial. #. Cleaner: CommandLine supports enum and other types directly, meaning that; there is less error and more security built into the library.

For example, in a compiler,; we would like to support the Unix-standard '``-o <filename>``' option to specify; where to put the output. With the CommandLine library, this is represented like; this:. .. _scalars arguments:; .. _here:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> OutputFilename(""o"", cl::desc(""Specify output filename""), cl::value_desc(""filename""));. This declares a global variable ""``OutputFilename``"" that is used to capture the; result of the ""``o``"" argument (first parameter). We specify that this is a; simple scalar option by using the ""``cl::opt``"" template (as opposed to the; ""``cl::list``"" template), and tell the CommandLine library that the data; type that we are parsing is a string. The second and third parameters (which are optional) are used to specify what to; output for the ""``-help``"" option. In this case, we get a line that looks like; this:. ::.

To support this style of; argument, the CommandLine library allows for `positional`_ arguments to be; specified for the program. These positional arguments are filled with command; line parameters that are not in option form. We use this feature like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> InputFilename(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input file>""), cl::init(""-""));. This declaration indicates that the first positional argument should be treated; as the input filename. Here we use the `cl::init`_ option to specify an initial; value for the command line option, which is used if the option is not specified; (if you do not specify a `cl::init`_ modifier for an option, then the default; constructor for the data type is used to initialize the value)",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst

The CommandLine library enforces that; the user can only specify one of the options, and it ensure that only valid enum; values can be specified. The ""``clEnumVal``"" macros ensure that the command; line arguments matched the enum values. With this option added, our help output; now is:. ::. USAGE: compiler [options] <input file>.

In this case, it is sort of awkward that flag names correspond directly to enum; names, because we probably don't want an enum definition named ""``g``"" in our; program. Because of this, we can alternatively write this example like this:. .. code-block:: c++. enum OptLevel {; Debug, O1, O2, O3; };. cl::opt<OptLevel> OptimizationLevel(cl::desc(""Choose optimization level:""),; cl::values(; clEnumValN(Debug, ""g"", ""No optimizations, enable debugging""),; clEnumVal(O1 , ""Enable trivial optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O2 , ""Enable default optimizations""),; clEnumVal(O3 , ""Enable expensive optimizations"")));. ...; if (OptimizationLevel == Debug) outputDebugInfo(...);; ...

https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:18545,Availability,avail,available,18545,"e looks like this:. .. code-block:: c++. enum DebugLev {; nodebuginfo, quick, detailed; };. // Enable Debug Options to be specified on the command line; cl::opt<DebugLev> DebugLevel(""debug_level"", cl::desc(""Set the debugging level:""),; cl::values(; clEnumValN(nodebuginfo, ""none"", ""disable debug information""),; clEnumVal(quick, ""enable quick debug information""),; clEnumVal(detailed, ""enable detailed debug information"")));. This definition defines an enumerated command line variable of type ""``enum; DebugLev``"", which works exactly the same way as before. The difference here is; just the interface exposed to the user of your program and the help output by; the ""``-help``"" option:. ::. USAGE: compiler [options] <input file>. OPTIONS:; Choose optimization level:; -g - No optimizations, enable debugging; -O1 - Enable trivial optimizations; -O2 - Enable default optimizations; -O3 - Enable expensive optimizations; -debug_level - Set the debugging level:; =none - disable debug information; =quick - enable quick debug information; =detailed - enable detailed debug information; -f - Enable binary output on terminals; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -o <filename> - Specify output filename; -quiet - Don't print informational messages. Again, the only structural difference between the debug level declaration and; the optimization level declaration is that the debug level declaration includes; an option name (``""debug_level""``), which automatically changes how the library; processes the argument. The CommandLine library supports both forms so that you; can choose the form most appropriate for your application. .. _lists:. Parsing a list of options; -------------------------. Now that we have the standard run-of-the-mill argument types out of the way,; lets get a little wild and crazy. Lets say that we want our optimizer to accept; a **list** of optimizations to perform, allowing duplicates. For example, we; might want to run: ""``compiler -dce -instsimpl",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:21249,Availability,error,error,21249,""". Thus, you can access it with standard vector; methods:. .. code-block:: c++. for (unsigned i = 0; i != OptimizationList.size(); ++i); switch (OptimizationList[i]); ... ... to iterate through the list of options specified. Note that the ""``cl::list``"" template is completely general and may be used with; any data types or other arguments that you can use with the ""``cl::opt``""; template. One especially useful way to use a list is to capture all of the; positional arguments together if there may be more than one specified. In the; case of a linker, for example, the linker takes several '``.o``' files, and; needs to capture them into a list. This is naturally specified as:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; cl::list<std::string> InputFilenames(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<Input files>""), cl::OneOrMore);; ... This variable works just like a ""``vector<string>``"" object. As such, accessing; the list is simple, just like above. In this example, we used the; `cl::OneOrMore`_ modifier to inform the CommandLine library that it is an error; if the user does not specify any ``.o`` files on our command line. Again, this; just reduces the amount of checking we have to do. Collecting options as a set of flags; ------------------------------------. Instead of collecting sets of options in a list, it is also possible to gather; information for enum values in a **bit vector**. The representation used by the; `cl::bits`_ class is an ``unsigned`` integer. An enum value is represented by a; 0/1 in the enum's ordinal value bit position. 1 indicating that the enum was; specified, 0 otherwise. As each specified value is parsed, the resulting enum's; bit is set in the option's bit vector:. .. code-block:: c++. bits |= 1 << (unsigned)enum;. Options that are specified multiple times are redundant. Any instances after; the first are discarded. Reworking the above list example, we could replace `cl::list`_ with `cl::bits`_:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::bits<Opts> OptimizationBits(cl::desc(""Available Optim",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst

To test to see if ``instsimplify`` was specified, we can use the ``cl:bits::isSet``; function:. .. code-block:: c++. if (OptimizationBits.isSet(instsimplify)) {; ...; }. It's also possible to get the raw bit vector using the ``cl::bits::getBits``; function:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned bits = OptimizationBits.getBits();.

Positional Arguments; --------------------. Positional arguments are those arguments that are not named, and are not; specified with a hyphen. Positional arguments should be used when an option is; specified by its position alone. For example, the standard Unix ``grep`` tool; takes a regular expression argument, and an optional filename to search through; (which defaults to standard input if a filename is not specified). Using the; CommandLine library, this would be specified as:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> Regex (cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<regular expression>""), cl::Required);; cl::opt<string> Filename(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input file>""), cl::init(""-""));.

OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more). ... and the resultant program could be used just like the standard ``grep``; tool. Positional arguments are sorted by their order of construction. This means that; command line options will be ordered according to how they are listed in a .cpp; file, but will not have an ordering defined if the positional arguments are; defined in multiple .cpp files. The fix for this problem is simply to define; all of your positional arguments in one .cpp file. Specifying positional options with hyphens; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes you may want to specify a value to your positional argument that; starts with a hyphen (for example, searching for '``-foo``' in a file). At; first, you will have trouble doing this, because it will try to find an argument; named '``-foo``', and will fail (and single quotes will not save you).

As a concrete example, lets say we are developing a replacement for the standard; Unix Bourne shell (``/bin/sh``). To run ``/bin/sh``, first you specify options; to the shell itself (like ``-x`` which turns on trace output), then you specify; the name of the script to run, then you specify arguments to the script. These; arguments to the script are parsed by the Bourne shell command line option; processor, but are not interpreted as options to the shell itself. Using the; CommandLine library, we would specify this as:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> Script(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input script>""), cl::init(""-""));; cl::list<string> Argv(cl::ConsumeAfter, cl::desc(""<program arguments>...""));; cl::opt<bool> Trace(""x"", cl::desc(""Enable trace output""));. which automatically provides the help output:. ::.

There are several limitations to when ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` options can be; specified. For example, only one ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` can be specified per; program, there must be at least one `positional argument`_ specified, there must; not be any `cl::list`_ positional arguments, and the ``cl::ConsumeAfter`` option; should be a `cl::list`_ option. .. _can be changed:; .. _Internal vs External Storage:.

Option Modifiers; ----------------. Option modifiers are the flags and expressions that you pass into the; constructors for `cl::opt`_ and `cl::list`_. These modifiers give you the; ability to tweak how options are parsed and how ``-help`` output is generated to; fit your application well. These options fall into five main categories:. #. Hiding an option from ``-help`` output. #. Controlling the number of occurrences required and allowed. #. Controlling whether or not a value must be specified. #. Controlling other formatting options. #. Miscellaneous option modifiers. It is not possible to specify two options from the same category (you'll get a; runtime error) to a single option, except for options in the miscellaneous; category.

Controlling the number of occurrences required and allowed; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This group of options is used to control how many time an option is allowed (or; required) to be specified on the command line of your program. Specifying a; value for this setting allows the CommandLine library to do error checking for; you. The allowed values for this option group are:. .. _cl::Optional:. * The **cl::Optional** modifier (which is the default for the `cl::opt`_ and; `cl::alias`_ classes) indicates that your program will allow either zero or; one occurrence of the option to be specified. .. _cl::ZeroOrMore:. * The **cl::ZeroOrMore** modifier (which is the default for the `cl::list`_; class) indicates that your program will allow the option to be specified zero; or more times. .. _cl::Required:. * The **cl::Required** modifier indicates that the specified option must be; specified exactly one time. .. _cl::OneOrMore:. * The **cl::OneOrMore** modifier indicates that the option must be specified at; least one time. * The **cl::ConsumeAfter** modifier is described in the `Positional arguments; section`_.

A boolean; argument can be enabled just by appearing on the command line, or it can have; an explicit '``-foo=true``'. If an option is specified with this mode, it is; illegal for the value to be provided without the equal sign. Therefore; '``-foo true``' is illegal. To get this behavior, you must use; the `cl::ValueRequired`_ modifier. .. _cl::ValueRequired:. * The **cl::ValueRequired** modifier (which is the default for all other types; except for `unnamed alternatives using the generic parser`_) specifies that a; value must be provided. This mode informs the command line library that if an; option is not provides with an equal sign, that the next argument provided; must be the value. This allows things like '``-o a.out``' to work. .. _cl::ValueDisallowed:. * The **cl::ValueDisallowed** modifier (which is the default for `unnamed; alternatives using the generic parser`_) indicates that it is a runtime error; for the user to specify a value. This can be provided to disallow users from; providing options to boolean options (like '``-foo=true``'). In general, the default values for this option group work just like you would; want them to. As mentioned above, you can specify the `cl::ValueDisallowed`_; modifier to a boolean argument to restrict your command line parser. These; options are mostly useful when `extending the library`_. .. _formatting option:. Controlling other formatting options; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The formatting option group is used to specify that the command line option has; special abilities and is otherwise different from other command line arguments.; As usual, you can only specify one of these arguments at most. .. _cl::NormalFormatting:. * The **cl::NormalFormatting** modifier (which is the default all options); specifies that this option is ""normal"". .. _cl::Positional:. * The **cl::Positiona",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst

Here, the '``l``', '``D``' and '``L``'; options are normal string (or list) options, that have the **cl::Prefix**; modifier added to allow the CommandLine library to recognize them. Note that; **cl::Prefix** options must not have the **cl::ValueDisallowed** modifier; specified. .. _grouping:; .. _cl::Grouping:. Controlling options grouping; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The **cl::Grouping** modifier can be combined with any formatting types except; for `cl::Positional`_. It is used to implement Unix-style tools (like ``ls``); that have lots of single letter arguments, but only require a single dash.; For example, the '``ls -labF``' command actually enables four different options,; all of which are single letters. Note that **cl::Grouping** options can have values only if they are used; separately or at the end of the groups. For `cl::ValueRequired`_, it is; a runtime error if such an option is used elsewhere in the group. The CommandLine library does not restrict how you use the **cl::Prefix** or; **cl::Grouping** modifiers, but it is possible to specify ambiguous argument; settings. Thus, it is possible to have multiple letter options that are prefix; or grouping options, and they will still work as designed. To do this, the CommandLine library uses a greedy algorithm to parse the input; option into (potentially multiple) prefix and grouping options.

Despite all of the built-in flexibility, the CommandLine option library really; only consists of one function `cl::ParseCommandLineOptions`_ and three main; classes: `cl::opt`_, `cl::list`_, and `cl::alias`_.

The ``cl::SetVersionPrinter`` function; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``cl::SetVersionPrinter`` function is designed to be called directly from; ``main`` and *before* ``cl::ParseCommandLineOptions``. Its use is optional. It; simply arranges for a function to be called in response to the ``--version``; option instead of having the ``CommandLine`` library print out the usual version; string for LLVM.

By default, the; CommandLine library uses an instance of ``parser<type>`` if the command line; option specifies that it uses values of type '``type``'. Because of this,; custom option processing is specified with specializations of the '``parser``'; class. The CommandLine library provides the following builtin parser specializations,; which are sufficient for most applications. It can, however, also be extended to; work with new data types and new ways of interpreting the same data. See the; `Writing a Custom Parser`_ for more details on this type of library extension. .. _enums:; .. _cl::parser:. * The generic ``parser<t>`` parser can be used to map strings values to any data; type, through the use of the `cl::values`_ property, which specifies the; mapping information. The most common use of this parser is for parsing enum; values, which allows you to use the CommandLine library for all of the error; checking to make sure that only valid enum values are specified (as opposed to; accepting arbitrary strings). Despite this, however, the generic parser class; can be used for any data type. .. _boolean flags:; .. _bool parser:. * The **parser<bool> specialization** is used to convert boolean strings to a; boolean value. Currently accepted strings are ""``true``"", ""``TRUE``"",; ""``True``"", ""``1``"", ""``false``"", ""``FALSE``"", ""``False``"", and ""``0``"". * The **parser<boolOrDefault> specialization** is used for cases where the value; is boolean, but we also need to know whether the option was specified at all.; boolOrDefault is an enum with 3 values, BOU_UNSET, BOU_TRUE and BOU_FALSE.; This parser accepts the same strings as **``parser<bool>``**. .. _strings:. * The **parser<string> specialization** simply stores the parsed string into the; string value specified. No conversion or modification of the data is; performed. .. _integers:; .. _int:. * The **parser<int> specialization*",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst

The drawback; of this approach is that users of your parser have to be aware that they are; using your parser instead of the builtin ones. To guide the discussion, we will discuss a custom parser that accepts file; sizes, specified with an optional unit after the numeric size.

In addition to simple scalar arguments,; the CommandLine library also provides primitives to support CommandLine option; `aliases`_, and `lists`_ of options. .. _aliases:. Argument Aliases; ----------------. So far, the example works well, except for the fact that we need to check the; quiet condition like this now:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; if (!Quiet && !Quiet2) printInformationalMessage(...);; ... ... which is a real pain! Instead of defining two values for the same; condition, we can use the ""`cl::alias`_"" class to make the ""``-q``"" option an; **alias** for the ""``-quiet``"" option, instead of providing a value itself:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<bool> Force (""f"", cl::desc(""Overwrite output files""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet (""quiet"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""));; cl::alias QuietA(""q"", cl::desc(""Alias for -quiet""), cl::aliasopt(Quiet));. The third line (which is the only one we modified from above) defines a ""``-q``""; alias that updates the ""``Quiet``"" variable (as specified by the `cl::aliasopt`_; modifier) whenever it is specified. Because aliases do not hold state, the only; thing the program has to query is the ``Quiet`` variable now. Another nice; feature of aliases is that they automatically hide themselves from the ``-help``; output (although, again, they are still visible in the ``-help-hidden output``). Now the application code can simply use:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; if (!Quiet) printInformationalMessage(...);; ... ... which is much nicer! The ""`cl::alias`_"" can be used to specify an; alternative name for any variable type, and has many uses. .. _unnamed alternatives using the generic parser:. Selecting an alternative from a set of possibilities; ----------------------------------------------------.

Note that the ""``cl::list``"" template is completely general and may be used with; any data types or other arguments that you can use with the ""``cl::opt``""; template. One especially useful way to use a list is to capture all of the; positional arguments together if there may be more than one specified. In the; case of a linker, for example, the linker takes several '``.o``' files, and; needs to capture them into a list. This is naturally specified as:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; cl::list<std::string> InputFilenames(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<Input files>""), cl::OneOrMore);; ... This variable works just like a ""``vector<string>``"" object. As such, accessing; the list is simple, just like above. In this example, we used the; `cl::OneOrMore`_ modifier to inform the CommandLine library that it is an error; if the user does not specify any ``.o`` files on our command line. Again, this; just reduces the amount of checking we have to do. Collecting options as a set of flags; ------------------------------------. Instead of collecting sets of options in a list, it is also possible to gather; information for enum values in a **bit vector**. The representation used by the; `cl::bits`_ class is an ``unsigned`` integer. An enum value is represented by a; 0/1 in the enum's ordinal value bit position. 1 indicating that the enum was; specified, 0 otherwise. As each specified value is parsed, the resulting enum's; bit is set in the option's bit vector:. .. code-block:: c++. bits |= 1 << (unsigned)enum;. Options that are specified multiple times are redundant. Any instances after; the first are discarded. Reworking the above list example, we could replace `cl::list`_ with `cl::bits`_:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::bits<Opts> OptimizationBits(cl::desc(""Available Optimizations:""),; cl::values(; clEnumVal(dce , ""Dead Code Elimination""),; clEnumVal(instsimplify , ""Instruction Simplification""),; clEnumVal",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst
