To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and; gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different; modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence; set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all; queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is; split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk; against the entire target set. Splitting the target database is less; time-efficient due to the slow, IO-limited merging of results. But it; reduces the memory required on each server to; (7 * N * L * #chunks + 21^k * 8) byte and allows; users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory; sizes. If the number of chunks is larger than the number of servers,; chunks will be distributed among servers and processed sequentially. By; default, MMseqs2 automatically decides which mode to pick based on the; available memory (assume that all machines have the same amount of; memory). Make sure that MMseqs2 was compiled with MPI by using the; HAVE_MPI=1 flag; (cmake -DHAVE_MPI=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..).; Our precomplied static version of MMseqs2 can not use MPI. To search; with multiple server just call the search and add the RUNNER variable.; The TMP folder has to be shared between all nodes (e.g. NFS); RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. For clustering just call the clustering. The TMP folder has to be shared; between all nodes (e.g. NFS); RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp. Common questions; This section describes common questions.; How to set the right alignment coverage to cluster; MMseqs has two modes to control the coverage.; (1) With --cov-mode 0 -c [0.0,1.0] only sequences are clustered that have a sequence length overlap greater than X% of the longer of the two sequences. This coverage mode should be use",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

This option is only activated while using --alignment-mode 3.; Both measures produces very similar results.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognise the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1.

MMseqs2 search supports sequence/sequence,; profile/sequence or sequence/profile searches. mmseqs cluster: Clusters sequences by similarity. It compares all; sequences in the sequence DB with each other using mmseqs search,; filters alignments according to user-specified criteria (max.; E-value, min. coverage,...), and runs mmseqs clust to group similar; sequences together into clusters. mmseqs clusterupdate: MMseqs2 incrementally updates a clustering,; given an existing clustering of a sequence database and a new; version of this sequence database (with new sequences being added; and others having been deleted). And the three core modules:. mmseqs prefilter: Computes k-mer similarity scores between all; sequences in the query database and all sequences in the target; database. mmseqs align: Computes Smith-Waterman alignment scores between all; sequences in the query database and the sequences of the target; database whose prefiltering scores computed by mmseqs prefilter; pass a minimum threshold. mmseqs clust: Computes a similarity clustering of a sequence; database based on Smith Waterman alignment scores of the sequence; pairs computed by mmseqs align.

Clustering using greedy set cover with clust.; Linclust needs a sequence database created by createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to increase the number of k-mers selected per sequence. The default is 20 k-mers per sequence.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; $ mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB oldDB_clustering outDB tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the results obtained by this older database; clustering, and the newer version of the sequence database. Then it adds; the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed from the newer database. Sequences which are not similar enough; to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility. Especially for the sequence search; it can be useful to adjust the prefiltering and alignment parameters; according to the needs of the user.

The option --max-seqscontrols the maximum number of prefiltering; results per query sequence. For very large databases (tens of; millions of sequences), it is a good advice to keep this number at; reasonable values (i.e. the default value 300). For considerably; larger values of --max-seqs, the size of the output can be in the; range of several TB of disc space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops.

The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file.

Alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; MMseqs2 needs uses a lot main memory (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; MMseqs Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the MMseqs database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format is inspired by ffindex, which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down the file system when millions of files would; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search. MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. cre",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

This workflow combines the prefiltering and alignment modules into a; fast and sensitive batch protein sequence search that compares all; sequences in the query database with all sequences in the target; database.; Query and target databases may be identical. The program outputs for; each query sequence all database sequences satisfying the search; criteria (such as sensitivity).; MMseqs2 can precompute the prefilter index createindex to speed up; subsequence prefilter index read-ins. We recommend to use an index for; iterative searches or if a target database will be reused several times.; However reading the index can be bottle neck when using a network file; systems (NFS). It is recommended to keep the index on a local hard; drive. If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than do not precompute the index. MMseqs2; will compute an index on the fly which reduces the IO volume by roughly; a factor of seven.; The underlying algorithm is explained in more detail in section; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the full parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files.

The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; We introduced an extremely fast redundancy filtering preprocessing step; that can cluster sequences of identical length and overlap. It reduces; each sequence to a -letter alphabet, computes a CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Afterwards we begin with three the cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high results significance threshold in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps. This time, the prefiltering is executed with a higher; sensitivity and a lower result significance threshold for catching; sequence pairs with lower sequence identity. In the last step, the whole; process is repeated again with the final target sensitivity.

Clustering using greedy set cover with clust.; Linclust needs a sequence database created by createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to increase the number of k-mers selected per sequence. The default is 20 k-mers per sequence.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; $ mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB oldDB_clustering outDB tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the results obtained by this older database; clustering, and the newer version of the sequence database. Then it adds; the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed from the newer database.

This algorithm adds all proteins; to a cluster, that are reachable in a breadth first search starting at; the representative with the most connections.; Note that we always recommend to use the cascaded clustering workflow; instead of the clustering module for larger databases, since the maximum; cluster size is limited to a quite low value otherwise (between 50 and; 300 for large databases containing millions of sequences, depending on; the database size).

How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. Regions satisfying one of the following criteria are masked out: (1) all 6-mers are under a bit score of 8.75 after amino acid local composition bias correction, (2) four consecutive identical residues, (3) four consecutive 2-mers with at most one mismatch between them, (4) four consecutive 3-mers at most two mismatches.

Then, these sequences are removed and the; next cluster is chosen from the remaining sequences.; The third clustering algorithm is the connected component algorithm.; This algorithm uses the transitivity of the relations to form larger; clusters with more remote homologies. This algorithm adds all proteins; to a cluster, that are reachable in a breadth first search starting at; the representative with the most connections.; Note that we always recommend to use the cascaded clustering workflow; instead of the clustering module for larger databases, since the maximum; cluster size is limited to a quite low value otherwise (between 50 and; 300 for large databases containing millions of sequences, depending on; the database size).

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module.

This coverage mode should be used to cluster full length protein sequences. The multi domain structure of proteins will be most likely preserved when using a coverage > 80% (-c 0.8).; For example:; q: MAVGTACRPA; t: -AVGTAC---. The coverage of would be 6/10=60%; q: -AVGTAC---; t: MAVGTACRPA.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If alignments are calculated and written for all the; prefiltering results, the disc space consumption is 1.75 times higher; than the prefiltering output size.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; you should use cascaded clustering (--cascaded option) which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally, therefore avoiding; excessive memory use.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB.; Disc Space; Since only one record is written per cluster, the memory usage is a; small fraction of the memory usage in the prefiltering and alignment; modules.; Workflows; The search and clustering workflows offer the possibility to set the; sensitivity option -s and the maximum sequences per query option; --max-seqs. --max-rejected option is set to INT_MAX per default.; Cascaded clust",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. Regions satisfying one of the following criteria are masked out: (1) all 6-mers are under a bit score of 8.75 after amino acid local composition bias correction, (2) four consecutive identical residues, (3) four consecutive 2-mers with ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; Installation; There are two ways of installing MMseqs: by compiling it or by using a; statically pre-compiled binary.; Static version;",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five database files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 32000 residues. The; identifiers of the new entries are suffixed with _0 to _(n-1) for; N splits.; For the next step, an index file of the the targetDB is computed for a; fast read in. It is recommend to compute the index if the targetDB is; reused for several searches.; $ mmseqs createindex targetDB. This call will create a targetDB.sk7 file. In this file extension the; letter s indicates the use of spaced k-mers and the k7 shows the; k-mer size of 7.; Then generate a directory for temporary files. MMseqs2 can produce a; high IO on the file system. It is recommend to create this temporary; folder on a local drive.; $ mkdir tmp.

Alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; MMseqs2 needs uses a lot main memory (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; MMseqs Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the MMseqs database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format is inspired by ffindex, which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down the file system when millions of files would; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search. MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. createdb; generates an MMseqs database from a FASTA sequence database. It assigns; each sequence in the FASTA file sequentially a numerical id. Sequences; that are longer than 32768 letters are split. createfasta converts an; MMseqs database to a FASTA formatted text file: the sequence headers contain the; DB identifiers preceded by >, and the sequence is extracted ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

Then, you can run; the clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. and cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp --cascaded. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjust with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if neither --cascaded nor -s are provided.; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; We introduced an extremely fast redundancy filtering preprocessing step; that can cluster sequences of identical length and overlap. It reduces; each sequence to a -letter alphabet, computes a CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Afterwards we begin with three the cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high results significance threshold in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps. This time, the prefiltering is executed with a higher; sensitivity and a lower result significance threshold for catching; sequence pairs with lower sequence identity.

MMseqs2 can handle profiles or protein sequences as input for the; queryDB.; The prefilter k-mer match stage is key to the high speed and; sensitivity.

Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If alignments are calculated and written for all the; prefiltering results, the disc space consumption is 1.75 times higher; than the prefiltering output size.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; you should use cascaded clustering (--cascaded option) which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally, therefore avoiding; excessive memory use.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities.

You can recognise the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).

The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; MMseqs Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the MMseqs database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format is inspired by ffindex, which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down the file system when millions of files would; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search. MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. createdb; generates an MMseqs database from a FASTA sequence database. It assigns; each sequence in the FASTA file sequentially a numerical id. Sequences; that are longer than 32768 letters are split. createfasta converts an; MMseqs database to a FASTA formatted text file: the sequence headers contain the; DB identifiers preceded by >, and the sequence is extracted ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux and Mac OS. The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the fi",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

This will also automatically install the bash completion (you might have; to do brew install bash-completion first). The formula will also work; for Linuxbrew.; Getting Started; Here we explain how to run a search for sequences matches in the query; database against a target database and how to cluster a sequence; database. Test data (a query and a target database for the sequence; search and a database for the clustering) are stored in the examples; folder.; Search; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB. You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five database files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 32000 residues. The; identifiers of the new entries are suffixed with _0 to _(n-1) for; N splits.; For the next step, an index file of the the targetDB is computed for a; fast read in. It is recommend to compute the index",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

Updating a clustered database; Having a big database of sequences that you already clustered, you may want to cluster a newer version of your sequence database without re-clustering everything from scratch. Here is an example of how to proceed:; Let's create an older version of the DB.fasta by trimming out some sequences:; $ cd examples; $ awk '/^>/{seqCount++;} {if (seqCount <= 19000) {print $0;}}' DB.fasta > DB_trimmed.fasta. Now we create the MMseqs sequence DBs, and cluster the old (trimmed) database:; $ mmseqs createdb DB.fasta DB_new; $ mmseqs createdb DB_trimmed.fasta DB_trimmed; $ mmseqs cluster DB_trimmed DB_trimmed_clu tmp. If you want to update DB_trimmed_clu with the newer version of your database DB_new; $ rm tmp/*; $ mmseqs clusterupdate DB_trimmed DB_new DB_trimmed_clu DB_clusterupdate tmp. DB_clusterupdate contains now the fresh clustering of DB_new.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 runs on modern UNIX operating systems; it was tested on Linux; and OSX. Alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; MMseqs2 needs uses a lot main memory (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; MMseqs Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the MMseqs database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format is inspired by ffindex, which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

MMseqs2; will compute an index on the fly which reduces the IO volume by roughly; a factor of seven.; The underlying algorithm is explained in more detail in section; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the full parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. and cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp --cascaded. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjust with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if neither --cascaded nor -s are provided.; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; We introduced an extremely fast redundancy filtering preprocessing step; that can cluster sequences of identical length and overlap. It reduces; each sequence to a -letter alphabet, computes a CRC32 hash value for the; full-length sequences, and places sequences with identical hash code; that satisfy the sequence identity threshold into the same cluster.; Afterwards we begin with three the cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9189be511af67934af3b76a06b7e1f43e61e46c1.html

Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps.

The search can be executed; by typing:; $ mmseqs search queryDB targetDB outDB tmp. MMseqs2 supports iterative searches which are similar to PSI-BLAST. The; following program call will run two iterations through the database. In; the first iteration sequences are searched against sequence and in the; second one profiles are used to search against sequences.; MMseqs2 will use the output for the first iteration sequence-sequence; search to computes a profile (result2profile).

The score per residue equivalent to a certain sequence identity is obtained by a linear regression using thousands of local alignments as training set.; Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clustering’s down to 50% sequence identity in very short time. To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity.

In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes).

For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low.

Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common.

In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood.

This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set.

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering Format.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; $ mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB oldDB_clustering outDB tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the results obtained by this older database; clustering, and the newer version of the sequence database. Then it adds; the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed from the newer database. Sequences which are not similar enough; to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; Taxonomy assignment using mmseqs taxonomy. By identifying homologs through searches with taxonomy annotated reference databases, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 (default) for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

The option --max-seqscontrols the maximum number of prefiltering; results per query sequence. For very large databases (tens of; millions of sequences), it is a good advice to keep this number at; reasonable values (i.e. the default value 300). For considerably; larger values of --max-seqs, the size of the output can be in the; range of several TB of disc space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time but can degrade the sensitivity. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module.

Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence using gapped local sequence alignment.

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster.

It works like the map step from the map/reduce pattern. It calls for every index entry the specified process with the passed parameters. The process reads the entry data from stdin and its stdout is written to a new entry in the result database. The tool supports OpenMP and MPI parallelization for spreading out the job over several compute nodes.; Example: An awk script which takes an alignment result entry from stdin and prints out all lines with an e-value <0.001 to stdout (Hint: the filterdb module can also solve this problem, but with less overhead):; mmseqs apply resultDB filteredResultDB -- awk '$4 < 0.001 { print; }'.

By identifying homologs through searches with taxonomy annotated reference databases, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time but can degrade the sensitivity. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

Convert stockholm MSAs to a FASTA formated MSA database.; mmseqs convertmsa Pfam-A.full.gz pfam_msa_db. Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modelled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment) .; We compute sequence profiles from the FASTA MSAs using; mmseqs msa2profile pfa",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

It works like the map step from the map/reduce pattern. It calls for every index entry the specified process with the passed parameters. The process reads the entry data from stdin and its stdout is written to a new entry in the result database. The tool supports OpenMP and MPI parallelization for spreading out the job over several compute nodes.; Example: An awk script which takes an alignment result entry from stdin and prints out all lines with an e-value <0.001 to stdout (Hint: the filterdb module can also solve this problem, but with less overhead):; mmseqs apply resultDB filteredResultDB -- awk '$4 < 0.001 { print; }'.

Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment.; Therefore, we strongly recommend to use cascaded clustering especially; to cluster larger databases and to obtain maximum sensitivity.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transforms the alignment results into an undirected graph. In this graph notation, the verticies represents the proteins, which are connected by an edge. An edge between proteins are introduced if the alignment criteria (e.g. --min-seq-id, -c and -e) are fulfilled.; Greedy Set cover (--cluster-mode 0) algorithm is an approximation for the NP-complete optimization problem called set cover. Greedy set cover removes the node with most connections and all connected nodes. These forms a cluster and the procedure repeats until all nodes are in a cluster.; The greedy set cover is followed by a reassignment step. Cluster member are assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time but can degrade the sensitivity. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If alignments are calculated and written for all the; prefiltering results, the disc space consumption is 1.75 times higher; than the prefiltering output size.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; MMseqs2 uses a cascaded clustering by default, which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB.; Disc Space; Since only one record is written per cluster, the memory usage is a; small fraction of the memory usage in the prefiltering and alignment; modules.; Workflows; The search and clustering workflows offer the possibility to set the; sensitivity option -s and the maximum sequences per query option; --max-seqs. --max-rejected option is set to INT_MAX per default.; Cascaded clust",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low. Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common. This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the '--max-accept 1' option to gain a further speedup.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood.

How to create a HHblits database; One can turn the output of a search (or clustering) into a HHblits database. You need to have HH-suite properly installed with MPI support. The following procedure creates an HHblits-compatible database ""searchMsa"" resulting from the enrichment of sequences of ""DBquery"" with the sequences of ""DBtarget"":; mmseqs search DBquery DBtarget searchOut tmp -a; mmseqs result2msa DBquery DBtarget searchOut searchMsa --compress; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m. The files /path/to/cs219.lib and /path/to/context_data.lib are provided in the ""data"" subfolder of your HH-suite installation. The parameters -x 0.3 -c 4 have been empirically found to perform well.; For creating an HHblits database from a clustering, the procedure is almost the same, except that you have to create symlinks to the ffindex _header and _sequence files needed by HHblits:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB clu cluMsa --compress; ln -s DB_h cluMsa_header.ffdata; ln -s DB_h.index cluMsa_header.ffindex; ln -s DB cluMsa_sequence.ffdata; ln -s DB.index cluMsa_sequence.ffindex; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i cluMsa -o cluMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m.

The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 runs on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and OSX.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; Each line of the index file contains, separated by tabs, (1) the ID, (2) the offset in bytes of the data_record; counted from the start of the data file, and; (3) the size of the data record. The IDs have to be sorted; numerically in ascending order, since for accessing a data record by; IDs the matching IDs are found by binary search.; Here is an example for a database containing four sequences:; PSSLDIRL\0GTLKRLSAHYTPAW\0AEAIFIHEG\0YTHGAGFDNDI\0.

The estimate uses the linear regression function (shown in red below) between the sequence identity computed as in (1) and the score per column in the scatter plot:. The score per column is a better measure of the degree of similarity than the actual sequence identity, because it also takes the degree of similarity between aligned amino acids and the number and length of gaps into account.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognise the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index.

Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modelled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment) .; We compute sequence profiles from the FASTA MSAs using; mmseqs msa2profile pfam_msa pfam_profile --match-mode 1.

To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjusted with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if -s is not provided.; Linclust can be used by calling linclust. The sensitivity can be adjusted by --kmer-per-seq (default 20).; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp .

In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence u",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment sc",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 runs on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and OSX. Additionally, we are providing a preview version for Windows.; The alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 (or optionally AVX2) and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may need a lot main memory; (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section; Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources,; we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Check system requirements; To check if MMseqs2 supports your system execute the following commands, depending on your ope",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

Use the BASH command completion; MMseqs comes with a bash command and parameter auto completion by pressing tab. The bash completion for subcommands and parameters can be installed by adding the following lines to your $HOME/.bash_profile:; if [ -f /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh ]; then; source /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh; fi. Getting Started; Here we explain how to run a search for sequences matches in the query; database against a target database and how to cluster a sequence; database. Test data (a query and a target database for the sequence; search and a database for the clustering) are stored in the examples; folder.; Search; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB. You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically.

Now we create the sequence DBs, and cluster the old (trimmed) database:; $ mmseqs createdb DB.fasta DB_new; $ mmseqs createdb DB_trimmed.fasta DB_trimmed; $ mmseqs cluster DB_trimmed DB_trimmed_clu tmp. If you want to update DB_trimmed_clu with the newer version of your database DB_new; $ rm tmp/*; $ mmseqs clusterupdate DB_trimmed DB_new DB_trimmed_clu DB_clusterupdate tmp.

Overview of MMseqs2 Commands; MMseqs2 contains five workflows that combine the core MMseqs2; modules (prefilter, align, kmermatcher, rescorediagonal and clust) and several other smaller ones.; Workflows:. mmseqs search: Compares all sequences in the query database with; all sequences in the target database, using the prefiltering and; alignment modules. MMseqs2 search supports sequence/sequence,; profile/sequence or sequence/profile searches. mmseqs cluster: Clusters sequences by similarity. It compares all; sequences in the sequence DB with each other using mmseqs search,; filters alignments according to user-specified criteria (max.; E-value, min. coverage,...), and runs mmseqs clust to group similar; sequences together into clusters. mmseqs linclust: Clusters sequences by similarity in linear time.; It clusteres magnitudes faster than mmseqs cluster but is less sensitive. mmseqs clusterupdate: MMse",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

Similar k-mers list length: Low sensitivity yields short similar; k-mer lists. Therefore, the speed of the prefiltering increases,; since only short k-mer lists have to be generated and less lookups; in the index table are necessary. However, the sensitivity of the; search decreases, since only very similar k-mers are generated and; therefore, the prefiltering can not identify sequence pairs with low; sequence identity. It is possible to speed best hits searches by stepwise increasing -s. MMseqs2 includes a workflow for this purpose. How to find the best hit the fastest way; The following graphic shows the average AUC sensitivity versus speed-up factor relative to BLAST for 637,000 test searches. White numbers in plot symbols give number of search iterations. It is furthermore possible to use change the k-mer lengths, which are; used in the prefiltering. Longer k-mers are more sensitive, since they; cause less chance matches. Though longer k-mers only pay off for; larger databases, since more time is needed for the k-mer list; generation, but less time for database matching. Therefore, the database; matching should take most of the computation time, which is only the; case for large databases. As default MMseqs try to compute the optimal; k-mer length based on the target database size.; Local alignment of prefiltering sequences using mmseqs align.

All open reading frames (ORFs) from each six frames can be; extracted by using extractorf. This ORFs are translated into proteins; by translatenucleotide. The tool offsetalignment will offset the alignment position to the orf start position + alignment start * 3.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster or mmseqs linclust. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjusted with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if -s is not provided.; Linclust can be used by calling linclust. The sensitivity can be adjusted by --kmer-per-seq (default 20).; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow cluster combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering --single-step-clustering runs the hashclust and prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in three steps. Clustering criteria; MMseqs2/Linclust and Linclust has three main criteria to link two sequences by an edge:; (1) a maximum E-value threshold (option -e [0,∞[) computed ac- cording to the gap-corrected Karlin-Altschul statistics using the ALP library;; (2) a minimum coverage (option -c [0,1], which is defined by the number of aligned residue pairs divided by either the maximum of the length of query/centre and target/non-centre sequences alnRes/max(qLen,tLen) (default mode, --cov-mode 0), or by the length of the targ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/91c80f615d6c6788a776f8ad998b8ca68e19a769.html

To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps. This time, the prefiltering is executed with a higher; sensitivity and a lower result significance threshold for catching; sequence pairs with lower sequence identity. In the last step, the whole; process is repeated again with the final target sensitivity. At last,; the clustering results are merged and the resulting clustering is; written to the output database.; Cascaded clustering yields more sensitive results than simple; clustering. Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment.; Therefore, we strongly recommend to use cascaded clustering especially; to cluster larger databases and to obtain maximum sensitivity.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transforms the alignment results into an undirected graph. In this graph notation, the verticies represents the proteins, which are connected by an edge. An edge between proteins are introduced if the alignment criteria (e.g. --min-seq-id, -c and -e) are fulfilled.; Greedy Set cover (--cluster-mode 0) algorithm is an approximation for the NP-complete optimization problem called set cover.

This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 runs on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and macOS. Additionally, we are providing a preview version for Windows.; The alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 (or optionally AVX2) and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may need a lot main memory; (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes.

Mapping Very Similar Sequences using mmseqs map. The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database. First it calls the prefilter module (with a low sensitivity setting) to detect high scoring diagonals and then computes an ungapped alignment with the rescorediagonal module. In contrast to the normal search, for maximum speed no gapped alignment is computed, query sequences are not masked for low complexity regions and no compositional bias correction is applied.; mmseqs map queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. MMseqs2 will provide a sorted (by E-value) list of best matches in resultDB. The best hit can be extracted with:; mmseqs filterdb resultDB bestResultDB --extract-lines 1. The format of resultDB is the same as in alignment format of the normal search workflow. The mapping workflow can also be used in iterative-best-hit mode, where each query that does not find any match is searched with higher sensitivity again.; If either queryDB or targetDB is a nucleotide sequence database, MMseqs2 will use the translated sequence search mode described above.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster or mmseqs linclust.

The score per residue equivalent to a certain sequence identity is obtained by a linear regression using thousands of local alignments as training set.; Cascaded clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clustering’s down to 50% sequence identity in very short time. To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps.

A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centr",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility. Especially for the sequence search; it can be useful to adjust the prefiltering and alignment parameters; according to the needs of the user. The detailed parameter lists for the; modules is provided in section Detailed Parameter List.; MMseqs2 contains three core modules: prefiltering, alignment and; clustering.; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter.

It sorts sequences by length and; in each step forms a cluster containing the longest sequence and; sequences that it matches. Then, these sequences are removed and the; next cluster is chosen from the remaining sequences.; The third clustering algorithm is the connected component algorithm.; This algorithm uses the transitivity of the relations to form larger; clusters with more remote homologies. This algorithm adds all sequences; to a cluster, that are reachable in a breadth first search starting at; the representative with the most connections.; File Formats; MMseqs2 database format; Most MMseqs2 modules consume and produce files in the MMseqs2 database format.; The format is inspired by ffindex (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab), which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down the file system when millions of files would; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search. MMseqs2 databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file. The <name>.dbtype contains the database type e.g. Protein, Nucleotide, ...; Each line of the index file contains, separated by tabs, (1) the ID, (2) the offset in bytes of the data_record; counted from the start of the data file, and; (3) the size of the data record. The IDs have to be sorted; numerically in ascending order, since for accessing a data record by; IDs the matching IDs are found by binary search.; Here is an example for a database containing four sequences:; PSSL",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

The major part of memory is required for the k-mer; index table of the database. For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (default a=20, does not include the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size. The overall memory consumption of the index table is; M = (7 * N * L + 8 a^k) byte. Therefore, the UniProtKB database version of April 2014 containing 55; million sequences with an average length 350 needs about 71 GB of main; memory.; If not enough memory is available to hold the whole database than it will automatically split the target database.; This mechanism is triggered when no index createindex is used to search. Indexed databases will load the whole index at once.; The --split-memory-limit parameter can give MMseqs2 an upper limit of system RAM to use for the large prefiltering data structures. MMseqs2 will still use some additional memory for its database structures etc. In total, --split-memory-limit will be about 80% of the total memory required. Order of magnitude suffices can be passed to --split-memory-limit, such as 10G for ten gigabyte or 1T for one terabyte of RAM.; Runtime; The prefiltering module is the most time-consuming step. It can scale; from minutes in runtime to days by adjusting the sensitivity setting.; Searching with 637000 protein sequences against 30 Mio Uniprot sequences; took around 12 minutes on 16 cores.; Disk Space; The prefiltering results for very large databases can grow to; considerable sizes (in the order of TB) of the disk space ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

The option -a adds the backtrace and there for increases the size to ~80 byte.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; MMseqs2 uses a cascaded clustering by default, which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB.

MPI assigns database splits to each; server and each server computes them using multiple cores (OpenMP).; Currently prefilter, align, result2profile, swapresults can take; advantage of MPI. To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and; gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different; modes are available.

The estimate uses the linear regression function (shown in red below) between the sequence identity computed as in (1) and the score per column in the scatter plot:. The score per column is a better measure of the degree of similarity than the actual sequence identity, because it also takes the degree of similarity between aligned amino acids and the number and length of gaps into account.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs2 checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs2 and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognize the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index.

For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should be used for high identities which is more of a technical task rather than measuring homology. Therefore, we turned off compositional bias correction, we do not mask the database, search with low sensitivity -s 2 and we align only ungapped.; How to build your own MMseqs2 compatible substitution matrices; You can use the (still Work in Progress) R script in util/format_substitution_matrix.R to prepare a substitution matrix for use in MMseqs2. It takes a matrix from stdin and returns the reformatted matrix to stdout.; util/format_substitution_matrix.R < data/MATRIX.mat > data/MATRIX.out; mmseqs search query db res tmp --sub-mat data/MATRIX.out.

Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 runs on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and macOS. Additionally, we are providing a preview version for Windows.; The alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 (or optionally AVX2) and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may need a lot main memory; (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disk space (~500 GB).

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the parameter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster.

This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the corresponding clustering, and the new version of the sequence database.; Then it adds the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed in the new database.

Other MMseqs2 modules work with taxonomyResult databases e.g. filtertaxdb can be used to extract taxa, addtaxonomy to augment a result database with taxonomic information.; Here is an example for using filtertaxdb to extract only results whose taxonomic assignment is any kind of virus (i.e., in the superkingdom ""viruses"").; mmseqs filtertaxdb seqTaxDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult.virus --taxon-list 10239; awk '$3 != 1 {print}' taxonomyResult.virus > taxonomyResult.virus.id; mmseqs createsubdb taxonomyResult.virus.id queryDB queryDB.virus; mmseqs createsubdb taxonomyResult.virus.id queryDB_h queryDB.virus_h. Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database; It is easy to create a seqTaxDB from a pre-existing local BLAST databases, if BLAST+ is installed. The following example creates an MMSeqs2 database from NCBI's nt database, but it also works with any of the other BLAST databases including the nr protein database.; First, manually download the NCBI taxonomy database dump:; wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz; mkdir taxonomy && tar -xxvf taxdump.tar.gz -C taxonomy.

For very large databases (tens of; millions of sequences), it is a good advice to keep this number at; reasonable values (i.e. the default value 300). For considerably; larger values of --max-seqs, the size of the output can be in the; range of several TB of disk space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time of the prefilter. Decreasing can speed but alignment but might degrade the sensitivity; since the order of the prefilter can differ from the alignment. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 2.0625E-4 seconds on one CPU. For example, computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge number of alignments has to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences.

It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence using gapped local sequence alignment.

To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB cluDB_old newDB_updated cluDB_updated tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the corresponding clustering, and the new version of the sequence database.; Then it adds the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed in the new database. Sequences which are not similar enough to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; clusterupdate creates a new sequence database newDB_updated that has consistent identifiers with the previous sequence databases. Meaning, the same sequences in both sets will have the same numeric identifier. All modules afterwards (for example convertalis) expect this sequence database to be passed.; Taxonomy assignment; Terminology; An MMseqs2 database seqTaxDB is a sequence database augmented with taxonomic information and a mapping file from each database key to its taxon id.

The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB:; mmseqs taxonomy queryDB seqTaxDB taxonomyResult tmp; mmseqs createtsv queryDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult.tsv. Each line of the result file taxonomyResult.tsv will contain a tab separated list of 1) query accession, 2) LCA NCBI taxon ID, 3) LCA rank name, and 4) LCA scientific name.; The --lca-ranks parameter can be supplied with a comma (,) separated string of taxonomic ranks. For example, --lca-ranks genus,family,order,superkingdom will resolve the respective ranks of the LCA and return a semicolon concatenated string of taxa as the fifth column of the result file.; The taxonomy result can be summarized in a Kraken-style report using the taxonomyreport module.; mmseqs taxonomyreport seqTaxDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult_report.

Write temporary files to local disk when running with MPI; As part of its computation, MMseqs2 writes temporary files corresponding to each of the database splits. The number of the database splits is determined by the number of servers and number of cores in each server. By default, temporary files are written to the shared disk.; In case the number of database splits is large, it would mean a high burden of I/O operations on the same disk. To avoid slowdowns due to this issue, an additional parameter can be passed to search in MPI mode:; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp --local-tmp /local/hdd/.

It works like the map step from the map/reduce pattern. It calls for every index entry the specified process with the passed parameters. The process reads the entry data from stdin and its stdout is written to a new entry in the result database (with the same key). The tool supports OpenMP and MPI parallelization for spreading out the job over several compute nodes.; Example: An awk script which takes an alignment result entry from stdin and prints out all lines with an e-value <0.001 to stdout (Hint: the filterdb module can also solve this problem, but with less overhead):; mmseqs apply resultDB filteredResultDB -- awk '$4 < 0.001 { print; }'.

How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single queries fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch).; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB; # alternative using vmtouch; vmtouch -l -d -t targetDB.idx.

This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should be used for high identities which is more of a technical task rather than measuring homology.

Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'. The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB:; mmseqs taxonomy queryDB seqTaxDB taxonomyResult tmp; mmseqs createtsv queryDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult.tsv. Each line of the result file taxonomyResult.tsv will contain a tab separated list of 1) query accession, 2) LCA NCBI taxon ID, 3) LCA rank name, and 4) LCA scientific name.; The --lca-ranks parameter can be supplied with a comma (,) separated string of taxonomic ranks.",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

Convert an external MSA into a profile; MMseqs2 can compute profiles from MSAs with the msa2profile module. It is possible to use MSAs in FASTA, A3M and CA3M format.

But it is also possible to compute a consensus query sequence from the MSA by; mmseqs convertmsa stockholm.msa msaDb; mmseqs msa2profile msaDb profileDB . The msa2profile decide if a column of the multiple sequence alignment will be considered in the profile or not. There are two different modes. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented.; By default, MMseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns of the first sequence except gaps '-' will be turned into profile columns.; This setting can be used for center star MSAs where the first sequence is the center. It is risky for large MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire MSA.; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions.

The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops.; The results of the prefilter are aligned from highest ungapped alignment score to lowest.; We increase a rejection counter after each alignment that does not fulfill the alignment criteria such; coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. If the counter is greater than --max-rejected then it stops the; alignment and does not take a look at any furthe",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

Clustering uses the prefilter, alignment and clustering module.; The cascaded clustering sets all the options controlling the size of the; output, speed and memory consumption, internally adjusting parameters in; each cascaded clustering step.; Each workflow uses a different set of default parameters that can be changed.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI; MMseqs2 can run on multiple cores and servers using OpenMP and; message passing interface (MPI). MPI assigns database splits to each; server and each server computes them using multiple cores (OpenMP).; Currently prefilter, align, result2profile, swapresults can take; advantage of MPI. To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and; gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different; modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence; set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all; queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is; split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk; against the entire target set. The number of chunks is controlled; through the --split parameter. Splitting the target database is less time-efficient due to the slow,; IO-limited merging of results, but it reduces the memory required on each server to:; ((7 * N * L) / #chunks + 21^k * 8) byte.

In the ""search"" case, those files are generated by MMseqs2, since it needs to merge the query and the target sequence databases. No merging is done for clustering, since both the query and target sequence database are the same.; How to create a target profile database (from PFAM); Download the latest version of the PFAM in stockholm format:; wget http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.full.gz. Convert stockholm MSAs to a FASTA formatted MSA database.; mmseqs convertmsa Pfam-A.full.gz pfam_msa_db. Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modeled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment) .; We compute sequence profiles from the FASTA MSAs using; mmseqs msa2profile pfam",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment.; Therefore, we strongly recommend to use cascaded clustering especially; to cluster larger databases and to obtain maximum sensitivity.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transform the alignment results into an undirected graph. In this graph notation, each vertex (i.e. node) represents a sequence, which is connected to other sequences by edges. An edge between a pair of sequences is introduced if the alignment criteria (e.g. --min-seq-id, -c and -e) are fulfilled.; The Greedy Set cover (--cluster-mode 0) algorithm is an approximation for the NP-complete optimization problem called set cover.

A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm.

For a database containing N sequences; with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index lists is; (N * L * 7) byte. Note that the memory consumption grows linearly; with the size of the sequence database. In addition, the index table; stores the pointer array and two auxiliary arrays with the memory; consumption of a^k*8 byte, where a is the size of the amino; acid alphabet (default a=20, does not include the unknown amino acid X) and k is; the k-mer size.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time of the prefilter. Decreasing can speed but alignment but might degrade the sensitivity; since the order of the prefilter can differ from the alignment. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 2.0625E-4 seconds on one CPU. For example, computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge number of alignments has to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops.; The results of the prefilter are aligned from highest ungapped alignment score to lowest.; We increase a rejection counter after each alignment that does not fulfill the alignment criteria such; coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. If the counter i",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

If all hits from the prefilter are accepted by the alignments than the disk space consumption is 1.75 times higher.; It needs roughly ~60 byte per record. The option -a adds the backtrace and there for increases the size to ~80 byte.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; MMseqs2 uses a cascaded clustering by default, which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB. The core algorithm of cluster mode --cluster-mode 0, 1, 2 runs single threaded; 3 runs multi threaded.; Disk Space; Since only one record is written per cluster, the memory usage is a; small fraction of the memory usage in the prefiltering and alignment; modules.; Workflows; The resource requirements depend on the combination of modules.; Search uses the prefilter and alignment module.

For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. If you change the parameters of the command call than the whole result is recomputed. We have a flag called --force-reuse to use the last temporary results also if parameters are changed.; How to control the speed of the search; There are several parameters to improve the search speed. Here is a list of the most important ones:. -s controls how many similar k-mers should be produced during the seeding stage. This is the most important parameter for speed, a lower value is fast but less sensitive and a higher one is sensitive but slower. The default search is already sensitive (default: 5.7). --exact-kmer-matching turns off similar k-mer generation and performs only an exact k-mer search (default: false). --max-accept controls how many hits should be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit was accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the prefiltering. This however would also allow more sequences to pass the prefiltering stage (default: true). --min-ungapped-score the minimum score a prefilter hit in the ungapped alignment stage requires to pass to the alignment stage (default: 15). How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches.

This however would also allow more sequences to pass the prefiltering stage (default: true). --min-ungapped-score the minimum score a prefilter hit in the ungapped alignment stage requires to pass to the alignment stage (default: 15). How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The number of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low. Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common. This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the --max-accept 1 option to gain a further speedup.; How does MMseqs2 handle low complexity; MMseqs2 uses tantan to reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood.

How to create a HHblits database; One can turn the output of a search (or clustering) into a HHblits database. You need to have HH-suite properly installed with MPI support. The following procedure creates an HHblits-compatible database ""searchMsa"" resulting from the enrichment of sequences of ""DBquery"" with the sequences of ""DBtarget"":; mmseqs search DBquery DBtarget searchOut tmp -a; mmseqs result2msa DBquery DBtarget searchOut searchMsa --compress; # MPI version ; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b; # no MPI version ; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -f -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b. The files /path/to/cs219.lib and /path/to/context_data.lib are provided in the ""data"" subfolder of your HH-suite installation. The parameters -x 0.3 -c 4 have been empirically found to perform well.; For creating an HHblits database from a clustering, the procedure is almost the same, except that you have to create symlinks to the ffindex _header and _sequence files needed by HHblits:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB clu cluMsa --compress; ln -s DB_h cluMsa_header.ffdata; ln -s DB_h.index cluMsa_header.ffindex; ln -s DB cluMsa_sequence.ffdata; ln -s DB.index cluMsa_sequence.ffindex; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i cluMsa -o cluMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b. In the ""search"" case, those files are generated by MMseqs2, since it needs to merge the query and the target sequence databases. No merging is done for clustering, since both the query and target sequence database are the same.; How to create a target profile database (from PFAM); Download the latest version of the PFAM in stockholm format:; wget http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.full.gz.

The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements a; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 runs on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and macOS.

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generate five files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 65535 residues. The; identifiers of the new entries are suffixed with _0 to _(n-1) for; N splits.; For the next step, an index file of the targetDB is computed for a; fast read-in. It is recommended to compute the index if the targetDB is; reused for several searches.; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp. This call will create a targetDB.idx file. It is just possible to have one index per database.; Then generate a directory for temporary files. MMseqs2 can produce a; high IO on the file system.

Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30).

It sorts sequences by length and; in each step forms a cluster containing the longest sequence and; sequences that it matches. Then, these sequences are removed and the; next cluster is chosen from the remaining sequences.; The third clustering algorithm is the connected component algorithm.; This algorithm uses the transitivity of the relations to form larger; clusters with more remote homologies. This algorithm adds all sequences; to a cluster, that are reachable in a breadth first search starting at; the representative with the most connections.; File Formats; MMseqs2 database format; Most MMseqs2 modules consume and produce files in the MMseqs2 database format.; The format is inspired by ffindex (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab), which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down the file system when millions of files would; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search. MMseqs2 databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file. The <name>.dbtype contains the database type e.g. Protein, Nucleotide, ...; Each line of the index file contains, separated by tabs, (1) the ID, (2) the offset in bytes of the data_record; counted from the start of the data file, and; (3) the size of the data record. The IDs have to be sorted; numerically in ascending order, since for accessing a data record by; IDs the matching IDs are found by binary search.; Here is an example for a database containing four sequences:; PSSL",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

In default the first sequence in the MSA is chosen as the query sequence. Gap columns in the query are discarded. But it is also possible to compute a consensus query sequence from the MSA by; mmseqs convertmsa stockholm.msa msaDb; mmseqs msa2profile msaDb profileDB . The msa2profile decide if a column of the multiple sequence alignment will be considered in the profile or not. There are two different modes. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented.; By default, MMseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns of the first sequence except gaps '-' will be turned into profile columns.; This setting can be used for center star MSAs where the first sequence is the center. It is risky for large MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire MSA.; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment).; If you want to use the Pfam database see How to create a target profile database (from PFAM).; Extract consensus or sequence information from a profile; Profiles generated by msa2profile, result2profile, convertprofiledb, etc. also contain the sequence information for the consensus and representative (= first sequence in the alignment) residues for each profile columns.; The consensus sequence can be extracted into a normal MMseqs2 sequence database with the profile2consensus module, while the representative sequence can be extracted with the profile2repseq module.; Convert HHsuite HMMs into a profile; It is possible to conve",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

These considerations are relevant; if the size of your database exceeds several millions of sequences and; are most important if the database size is in the order of tens of; millions of sequences.; Prefiltering module; The prefiltering module can use a lot of resources (memory consumption,; total runtime and disk space), if the parameters are not set; appropriately.; Memory Consumption; For maximum efficiency of the prefiltering, the entire database should; be held in RAM.

For clustering just call the clustering. The TMP folder has to be shared; between all nodes (e.g. NFS); RUNNER=""mpirun -pernode -np 42"" mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp. Write temporary files to local disk when running with MPI; As part of its computation, MMseqs2 writes temporary files corresponding to each of the database splits. The number of the database splits is determined by the number of servers and number of cores in each server. By default, temporary files are written to the shared disk.; In case the number of database splits is large, it would mean a high burden of I/O operations on the same disk. To avoid slowdowns due to this issue, an additional parameter can be passed to search in MPI mode:; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp --local-tmp /local/hdd/. Passing this parameter will write the temporary files of each server (created by its cores) on the indicated path (local disk) and reduce the number of temporary files handled on the shared disk.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using batch systems; MMseqs2 comes with tools to split database to distribute jobs in batch systems (like sge, slurm, moab, lsf, ...).; However, the MPI solution is preferred if available since it optimizes the distribution of computing load.; Splitting the query database can be used to distribute the load, MMseqs2 has a module called splitdb that splits the database in --split N chunks.

The estimate uses the linear regression function (shown in red below) between the sequence identity computed as in (1) and the score per column in the scatter plot:. The score per column is a better measure of the degree of similarity than the actual sequence identity, because it also takes the degree of similarity between aligned amino acids and the number and length of gaps into account.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs2 checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs2 and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognize the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. If you change the parameters of the command call than the whole result is recomputed.

Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit was accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the prefiltering. This however would also allow more sequences to pass the prefiltering stage (default: true). --min-ungapped-score the minimum score a prefilter hit in the ungapped alignment stage requires to pass to the alignment stage (default: 15). How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The number of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7.

Clustering criteria; MMseqs2/Linclust and Linclust has three main criteria, inferred by a local alignment, to link two sequences by an edge:; (1) a maximum E-value threshold (option -e [0,\infty[) computed according to the gap-corrected Karlin-Altschul statistics using the ALP library.; (2) a minimum coverage (option -c [0,1], which is defined by the number of aligned residue pairs divided by either the maximum of the length of query/centre and target/non-centre sequences alnRes/max(qLen,tLen) (default mode, --cov-mode 0), or by the length of the target/non-centre sequence alnRes/tLen (--cov-mode 1), or by the length of the query/centre alnRes/qLen (--cov-mode 2).

In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence u",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

It compares all; sequences in the sequence DB with each other using mmseqs search,; filters alignments according to user-specified criteria (max.; E-value, min. coverage,...), and runs mmseqs clust to group similar; sequences together into clusters. mmseqs linclust: Clusters sequences by similarity in linear time.; It clusters magnitudes faster than mmseqs cluster but is less sensitive. mmseqs clusterupda",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9246fd10ddb8312406061cf7e0178d4b1d16615f.html

Similar k-mers list length: Low sensitivity yields short similar; k-mer lists. Therefore, the speed of the prefiltering increases,; since only short k-mer lists have to be generated and less lookups; in the index table are necessary. However, the sensitivity of the; search decreases, since only very similar k-mers are generated and; therefore, the prefiltering cannot identify sequence pairs with low; sequence identity. It is possible to speed best hits searches by stepwise increasing -s. MMseqs2 includes a workflow for this purpose. How to find the best hit the fastest way; The following graphic shows the average AUC sensitivity versus speed-up factor relative to BLAST for 637,000 test searches. White numbers in plot symbols give number of search iterations. It is furthermore possible to use change the k-mer lengths, which are; used in the prefiltering. Longer k-mers are more sensitive, since they; cause less chance matches. Though longer k-mers only pay off for; larger databases, since more time is needed for the k-mer list; generation, but less time for database matching. Therefore, the database; matching should take most of the computation time, which is only the; case for large databases. As default MMseqs2 ties to compute the optimal; k-mer length based on the target database size.; Local alignment of prefiltering sequences using mmseqs align. In the alignment module, you can also specify either identical or; different query and target databases.

Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are shell scripts chaining elementary MMseqs2 module and other workflows together. A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h.

For disk space requirements, see the section; Disk Space.; The alignment consists of two steps the prefilter and alignment. To; run the search, type:; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. Search as standard does compute the score only. If you need the; alignment information add the option “-a”.

A very fast search would use a sensitivity of -s 1.0, while a very sensitive search would use a sensitivity of up to -s 7.0. A detailed guide how to speed up searches is here.; The output can be customized with the --format-output option e.g. --format-output ""query,target,qaln,taln"" returns the query and target accession and the pairwise alignments in tab separated format.

To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps.

In the last step, the whole; process is repeated again with the final target sensitivity. At last,; the clustering results are merged and the resulting clustering is; written to the output database.; Cascaded clustering yields more sensitive results than simple; clustering.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. createdb; generates an MMseqs database from a FASTA sequence database. It assigns; each sequence in the FASTA file sequentially a numerical id.

The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clusterings down to 50% sequence identity in very short time.; To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps.

An edge between proteins are introduced if --min-seq-id, -c and -e are fulfilled. Greedy set cover removes the node with most connections and all connected nodes. These form a cluster and the procedure repeats until all nodes are in a cluster.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologes. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size.; Linclust is composed of five stages: 1.) Finding exact k-mer matches with kmermatcher, 2.) Hamming distance pre-clustering with rescorediagonal and clust, 3.) Ungapped alignment filtering with rescorediagonal, 4.) Local gapped sequence alignment with align and 5.) Clustering using greedy set cover with clust.; Linclust needs a sequence database created by createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to increase the number of k-mers selected per sequence.

The estimate uses the linear regression function (shown in red below) between the sequence identity computed as in (1) and the score per column in the scatter plot:. The score per column is a better measure of the degree of similarity than the actual sequence identity, because it also takes the degree of similarity between aligned amino acids and the number and length of gaps into account.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognise the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index.

If you want to update DB_trimmed_clu with the newer version of your database DB_new; $ rm tmp/*; $ mmseqs clusterupdate DB_trimmed DB_new DB_trimmed_clu DB_clusterupdate tmp. DB_clusterupdate contains now the fresh clustering of DB_new.; MMseqs Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the MMseqs database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format is inspired by ffindex, which was developed by Andreas Hauser.; It avoids drastically slowing down the file system when millions of files would; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search. MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; convers",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html

Overview of MMseqs2 Commands; MMseqs2 contains three workflows that combine the three core MMseqs2; modules (prefilter, align, and clust) and several other smaller ones.; Workflows:. mmseqs search: Compares all sequences in the query database with; all sequences in the target database, using the prefiltering and; alignment modules. MMseqs2 search supports sequence/sequence,; profile/sequence or sequence/profile searches. mmseqs cluster: Clusters sequences by similarity.

The option --max-seqscontrols the maximum number of prefiltering; results per query sequence. For very large databases (tens of; millions of sequences), it is a good advice to keep this number at; reasonable values (i.e. the default value 300). For considerably; larger values of --max-seqs, the size of the output can be in the; range of several TB of disc space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module.

The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

MMseqs2; will compute an index on the fly which reduces the IO volume by roughly; a factor of seven.; The underlying algorithm is explained in more detail in section; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter, and the full parameter list can be found in; section Search Workflow.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. and cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp --cascaded.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If alignments are calculated and written for all the; prefiltering results, the disc space consumption is 1.75 times higher; than the prefiltering output size.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; you should use cascaded clustering (--cascaded option) which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally, therefore avoiding; excessive memory use.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB.; Disc Space; Since only one record is written per cluster, the memory usage is a; small fraction of the memory usage in the prefiltering and alignment; modules.; Workflows; The search and clustering workflows offer the possibility to set the; sensitivity option -s and the maximum sequences per query option; --max-seqs. --max-rejected option is set to INT_MAX per default.; Cascaded clust",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html

How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. We use TANTAN with a threshold of 90% probability for low complexity.

How to create a HHblits database; One can turn the output of a search (or clustering) into a HHblits database. You need to have HH-suite properly installed with MPI support. The following procedure creates an HHblits-compatible database ""searchMsa"" resulting from the enrichment of sequences of ""DBquery"" with the sequences of ""DBtarget"":; mmseqs search DBquery DBtarget searchOut tmp -a; mmseqs result2msa DBquery DBtarget searchOut searchMsa --compress; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m. The files /path/to/cs219.lib and /path/to/context_data.lib are provided in the ""data"" subfolder of your HH-suite installation. The parameters -x 0.3 -c 4 have been empirically found to perform well.; For creating an HHblits database from a clustering, the procedure is almost the same, except that you have to create symlinks to the ffindex _header and _sequence files needed by HHblits:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB clu cluMsa --compress; ln -s DB_h cluMsa_header.ffdata; ln -s DB_h.index cluMsa_header.ffindex; ln -s DB cluMsa_sequence.ffdata; ln -s DB.index cluMsa_sequence.ffindex; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i cluMsa -o cluMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux and Mac OS.

The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; Installation; There are two ways of installing MMseqs: by compiling it or by using a; statically pre-compiled binary.; Static version;",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five database files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 32000 residues. The; identifiers of the new entries are suffixed with _0 to _(n-1) for; N splits.; For the next step, an index file of the the targetDB is computed for a; fast read in. It is recommend to compute the index if the targetDB is; reused for several searches.; $ mmseqs createindex targetDB. This call will create a targetDB.sk7 file. In this file extension the; letter s indicates the use of spaced k-mers and the k7 shows the; k-mer size of 7.; Then generate a directory for temporary files. MMseqs2 can produce a; high IO on the file system. It is recommend to create this temporary; folder on a local drive.; $ mkdir tmp.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters.

Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If alignments are calculated and written for all the; prefiltering results, the disc space consumption is 1.75 times higher; than the prefiltering output size.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; you should use cascaded clustering (--cascaded option) which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally, therefore avoiding; excessive memory use.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB.; Disc Space; Since only one record is written per cluster, the memory usage is a; small fraction of the memory usage in the prefiltering and alignment; modules.; Workflows; The search and clustering workflows offer the possibility t",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html

The estimate uses the linear regression function (shown in red below) between the sequence identity computed as in (1) and the score per column in the scatter plot:. The score per column is a better measure of the degree of similarity than the actual sequence identity, because it also takes the degree of similarity between aligned amino acids and the number and length of gaps into account.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognise the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1.

The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the fi",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html

The bash completion for; subcommands and parameters can be installed by sourcing the; util/bash-completion.sh file in your $HOME/.bash_profile:; source path/to/mmseqs/util/bash-completion.sh; Homebrew (Linux/MacOS); If you are using Mac OS you can install MMseqs through Homebrew by; executing the following:; $ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/master/Formula/mmseqs.rb --HEAD. This will also automatically install the bash completion (you might have; to do brew install bash-completion first). The formula will also work; for Linuxbrew.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 should run on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and OSX.

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five database files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 32000 residues.

To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files.

The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clusterings down to 50% sequence identity in very short time.; To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high;",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/936a31ccdd3552cc7c4b76c8b76f6113a129d8f3.html

The IDs have to be sorted; numerically in ascending order, since for accessing a data record by; IDs the matching IDs are found by binary search.; Here is an example for a database containing four sequences:; PSSLDIRL\0GTLKRLSAHYTPAW\0AEAIFIHEG\0YTHGAGFDNDI\0.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. createdb; generates an MMseqs database from a FASTA sequence database.

Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clusterings down to 50% sequence identity in very short time.; To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps.

Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment.; Therefore, we strongly recommend to use cascaded clustering especially; to cluster larger databases and to obtain maximum sensitivity.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size.; Linclust is composed of five stages: 1.) Finding exact k-mer matches with kmermatcher, 2.) Hamming distance pre-clustering with rescorediagonal and clust, 3.) Ungapped alignment filtering with rescorediagonal, 4.) Local gapped sequence alignment with align and 5.) Clustering using greedy set cover with clust.; Linclust needs a sequence database created by createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to increase the number of k-mers selected per sequence. The default is 20 k-mers per sequence.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate.

MMseqs2 search supports sequence/sequence,; profile/sequence or sequence/profile searches. mmseqs cluster: Clusters sequences by similarity. It compares all; sequences in the sequence DB with each other using mmseqs search,; filters alignments according to user-specified criteria (max.; E-value, min. coverage,...), and runs mmseqs clust to group similar; sequences together into clusters. mmseqs clusterupdate: MMseqs2 incrementally updates a clustering,; given an existing clustering of a sequence database and a new; version of this sequence database (with new sequences being added; and others having been deleted). And the three core modules:. mmseqs prefilter: Computes k-mer similarity scores between all; sequences in the query database and all sequences in the target; database. mmseqs align: Computes Smith-Waterman alignment scores between all; sequences in the query database and the sequences of the target; database whose prefiltering scores computed by mmseqs prefilter; pass a minimum threshold. mmseqs clust: Computes a similarity clustering of a sequence; database based on Smith Waterman alignment scores of the sequence; pairs computed by mmseqs align.

Clustering using greedy set cover with clust.; Linclust needs a sequence database created by createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to increase the number of k-mers selected per sequence. The default is 20 k-mers per sequence.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; $ mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB oldDB_clustering outDB tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the results obtained by this older database; clustering, and the newer version of the sequence database. Then it adds; the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed from the newer database. Sequences which are not similar enough; to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility. Especially for the sequence search; it can be useful to adjust the prefiltering and alignment parameters; according to the needs of the user. The detailed parameter lists for the; modules is provided in section Detailed Parameter List.; MMseqs2 contains three core modules: prefiltering, alignment and; clustering.; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter.

The option --max-seqscontrols the maximum number of prefiltering; results per query sequence. For very large databases (tens of; millions of sequences), it is a good advice to keep this number at; reasonable values (i.e. the default value 300). For considerably; larger values of --max-seqs, the size of the output can be in the; range of several TB of disc space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results.

The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules.

The reasons are the limited result list length in; the prefiltering and alignment modules (the maximum list length; determines the maximum cluster size in the simple clustering workflow); and the high memory consumption of the clustering for large databases; with many alignment results per query.; Output File Formats; General MMseqs database format; Results of MMseqs2 commands are stored in MMseqs database format.; MMseqs databases have a simple ID => data_record structure, in; which data records (corresponding to contents of files); can be accessed using their unique numerical identifiers (IDs); (corresponding to the file names).; MMseqs databases consist of two files: an index file; <name>.index and a data file <name>.; The data file contains the plain concatenated data records,; separated by single \0 bytes (which in some editors",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

Disc Space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If alignments are calculated and written for all the; prefiltering results, the disc space consumption is 1.75 times higher; than the prefiltering output size.; Clustering Module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory Consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; you should use cascaded clustering (--cascaded option) which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally, therefore avoiding; excessive memory use.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB.; Disc Space; Since only one record is written per cluster, the memory usage is a; small fraction of the memory usage in the prefiltering and alignment; modules.; Workflows; The search and clustering workflows offer the possibility to set the; sensitivity option -s and the maximum sequences per query option; --max-seqs. --max-rejected option is set to INT_MAX per default.; Cascaded clust",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. Regions satisfying one of the following criteria are masked out: (1) all 6-mers are under a bit score of 8.75 after amino acid local composition bias correction, (2) four consecutive identical residues, (3) four consecutive 2-mers with ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

How to create a HHblits database; One can turn the output of a search (or clustering) into a HHblits database. You need to have HH-suite properly installed with MPI support. The following procedure creates an HHblits-compatible database ""searchMsa"" resulting from the enrichment of sequences of ""DBquery"" with the sequences of ""DBtarget"":; mmseqs search DBquery DBtarget searchOut tmp -a; mmseqs result2msa DBquery DBtarget searchOut searchMsa --compress; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m. The files /path/to/cs219.lib and /path/to/context_data.lib are provided in the ""data"" subfolder of your HH-suite installation. The parameters -x 0.3 -c 4 have been empirically found to perform well.; For creating an HHblits database from a clustering, the procedure is almost the same, except that you have to create symlinks to the ffindex _header and _sequence files needed by HHblits:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB clu cluMsa --compress; ln -s DB_h cluMsa_header.ffdata; ln -s DB_h.index cluMsa_header.ffindex; ln -s DB cluMsa_sequence.ffdata; ln -s DB.index cluMsa_sequence.ffindex; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i cluMsa -o cluMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m. In the ""search"" case, those files are generated by MMseqs2, since it needs to merge the query and the target sequence databases. No merging is done for clustering, since both the query and target sequence database are the same.; Important Parameters to control the workflows; Search Workflow; Compares all sequences in the query database with all sequences in the; target database.; Usage:; mmseqs search <queryDB> <targetDB> <outDB> <tm",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This could allow for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; Installation; There are two ways of installing MMseqs: by compiling it or by using a; statically pre-compiled binary.; Static version;",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five database files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 32000 residues. The; identifiers of the new entries are suffixed with _0 to _(n-1) for; N splits.; For the next step, an index file of the the targetDB is computed for a; fast read in. It is recommend to compute the index if the targetDB is; reused for several searches.; $ mmseqs createindex targetDB. This call will create a targetDB.sk7 file. In this file extension the; letter s indicates the use of spaced k-mers and the k7 shows the; k-mer size of 7.; Then generate a directory for temporary files.

The score per column is a better measure of the degree of similarity than the actual sequence identity, because it also takes the degree of similarity between aligned amino acids and the number and length of gaps into account.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognise the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The step size can be defined with --sens-step-size.; S_next_it = S_prev_it + S_step_size. Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-step-size 3 -s 7 --max-accept 1. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low compl",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux and Mac OS. The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the fi",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

MMseqs2 comes with a bash command and parameter auto-completion, which; can usually activated by pressing the tab key. The bash completion for; subcommands and parameters can be installed by sourcing the; util/bash-completion.sh file in your $HOME/.bash_profile:; source path/to/mmseqs/util/bash-completion.sh; Homebrew (Linux/MacOS); If you are using Mac OS you can install MMseqs through Homebrew by; executing the following:; $ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/master/Formula/mmseqs.rb --HEAD. This will also automatically install the bash completion (you might have; to do brew install bash-completion first). The formula will also work; for Linuxbrew.; System Requirements; MMseqs2 should run on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and OSX. Alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may need a lot main memory; (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB).

Test data (a query and a target database for the sequence; search and a database for the clustering) are stored in the examples; folder.; Search; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB. You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five database files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FASTA QUERY.fasta; input sequences.; The queryDB and queryDB.index files contain the amino acid; sequences, while the queryDB_h and queryDB_h.index file contain the; FASTA headers. The queryDB.lookup file contains a list of tab; separated fields that map from the internal identifier to the FASTA; identifiers.; Important:; createdb splits long sequences into multiple separate entries; automatically. This avoids excessive resource requirements for later; steps. The default value is to split sequences after 32000 residues.

Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clusterings down to 50% sequence identity in very short time.; To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high;",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/93a2ad05b7a6496acb9b06d7dd8d0c37373da8f7.html

Mapping very similar sequences using mmseqs map. The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database. First it calls the prefilter module (with a low sensitivity setting) to detect high scoring diagonals and then computes an ungapped alignment with the rescorediagonal module. In contrast to the normal search, for maximum speed no gapped alignment is computed, query sequences are not masked for low complexity regions and no compositional bias correction is applied.; mmseqs map queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. MMseqs2 will provide a sorted (by E-value) list of best matches in resultDB. The best hit can be extracted with:; mmseqs filterdb resultDB bestResultDB --extract-lines 1. The format of resultDB is the same as in alignment format of the normal search workflow. The mapping workflow can also be used in iterative-best-hit mode, where each query that does not find any match is searched with higher sensitivity again.; If either queryDB or targetDB is a nucleotide sequence database, MMseqs2 will use the translated sequence search mode described above.; Clustering databases using mmseqs cluster or mmseqs linclust.

A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes).

Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; The databases module provides a easy way to download and setup taxonomy; databases that we predefined (see Downloading databases). Follow this section to learn how to manually create a seqTaxDB.; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot idmapping and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier. By default, createtaxdb downloads the Uniprot id mapping file (idmapping.dat.gz), and thus only supports Uniprot identifiers.; If your seqTaxDB does not contain Uniprot ids or you wish to provide an alternative source for the taxonomic information, please follow the instructions here:. To create a seqTaxDB from an existing NCBI BLAST database (such as nr or nt), see the section Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database.; For the SILVA database use mmseqs databases or see Create a seqTaxDB for SILVA for an example how to build it yourself.; For the GTDB database see Create a seqTaxDB for GTDB.; For other database types, the mapping must be created manually, as described in section Create a seqTaxDB by manual annotation of a sequence database. Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels.

Therefore, the UniProtKB database version of April 2014 containing 55; million sequences with an average length 350 needs about 71 GB of main; memory.; If not enough memory is available to hold the whole database than it will automatically split the target database.; This mechanism is triggered when no index createindex is used to search.; The --split-memory-limit parameter can give MMseqs2 an upper limit of system RAM to use for the large prefiltering data structures. MMseqs2 will still use some additional memory for its database structures etc. In total, --split-memory-limit will be about 80% of the total memory required. Order of magnitude suffices can be passed to --split-memory-limit, such as 10G for ten gigabyte or 1T for one terabyte of RAM.; Runtime; The prefiltering module is the most time-consuming step.

The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; MMseqs2 uses a cascaded clustering by default, which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step.

The estimate uses the linear regression function (shown in red below) between the sequence identity computed as in (1) and the score per column in the scatter plot:. The score per column is a better measure of the degree of similarity than the actual sequence identity, because it also takes the degree of similarity between aligned amino acids and the number and length of gaps into account.; How to restart a search or clustering workflow; MMseqs2 checks if files are already computed in the tmpDir and skips already computed results.; To restart delete temporary result files from the crashing step that were created by MMseqs2 and restart the workflow with the same program call again. You can recognize the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab). For example, if the merge step of the alignment fails while using 56 threads then the result could be recovered by using the following command.; for i in $(seq 0 55); do ffindex_build -a aln{,.tmp.index} -d aln.$i -i aln.index.$i ; done; LC_ALL=C sort --parallel 28 -n -k 1,1 aln.tmp.index > aln.index. If you change the parameters of the command call than the whole result is recomputed.

The default search is already sensitive (default: 5.7). --exact-kmer-matching turns off similar k-mer generation and performs only an exact k-mer search (default: false). --max-accept controls how many hits should be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit was accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the prefiltering. This however would also allow more sequences to pass the prefiltering stage (default: true). --min-ungapped-score the minimum score a prefilter hit in the ungapped alignment stage requires to pass to the alignment stage (default: 15). How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches.

This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM.

TSV file with adjecency list of sequences forming the sets (sets.tsv):. A7ZUJ8	A7ZUJ8; A7ZUJ8	P0A7J6; A7ZUJ8	Q1C1T9. Next, we create a sequence database with taxonomy information:; mmseqs createdb sequences.fasta seqdb; mmseqs createtaxdb seqdb tmp --tax-mapping-file taxonomy.tsv. This will also download the latest taxonomy dump from the NCBI. You can specify your own with the --ncbi-tax-dump parameter.; We replace the accessions with the internal MMseqs2 numeric entry keys:; awk 'NR == FNR { f[$2] = $1; next; } { line = f[$1]""\t""f[$2]; for(i = 3; i <= NF; i++) { line=line""\t""$i } print line; }' seqdb.lookup sets.tsv > sets_numerickeys.tsv. And turn this database into a kind of clustering result that can be read by other MMseqs2 modules:; mmseqs tsv2db sets_numerickeys.tsv setsdb --output-dbtype 6. With everything set up, we can compute lowest common ancestors of each given set (in this case a single set):; mmseqs lca seqdb setsdb lcadb.

Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set. We are using MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the; UniProtKB database clustered down to 30% sequence similarity threshold.; This database is available at; uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System requirements; MMseqs2 runs on modern UNIX operating systems and is tested on Linux; and macOS. Additionally, we are providing a preview version for Windows.; MMseqs2 takes advantage of multi-core systems through OpenMP and uses the SIMD capabilities of the system.; Optimal performance requires a system supporting the AVX2 instruction set, however SSE4.1 and very old systems with SSE2 are also supported.; MMseqs2 also supports the PPC64LE and ARM64 processor architectures, these require support for the AltiVec or NEON SIMD instruction sets, respectively.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may need a lot main memory; (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes.

MMseqs2 search supports sequence/sequence,; profile/sequence or sequence/profile searches. mmseqs cluster: Clusters sequences by similarity. It compares all; sequences in the sequence DB with each other using mmseqs search,; filters alignments according to user-specified criteria (max.; E-value, min. coverage,...), and runs mmseqs clust to group similar; sequences together into clusters. mmseqs linclust: Clusters sequences by similarity in linear time.; It clusters magnitudes faster than mmseqs cluster but is less sensitive. mmseqs clusterupdate: MMseqs2 incrementally updates a clustering,; given an existing clustering of a sequence database and a new; version of this sequence database (with new sequences being added; and others having been deleted). mmseqs taxonomy Taxonomy assignment by computing the lowest common ancestor of homologs using 2bLCA. mmseqs map: Map calls the search workflow with different default parameters and alignment strategy.; Map should be used for high identities searches, which is more of a technical task rather than measuring homology. And the five core modules:. mmseqs prefilter: Computes k-mer similarity scores between all; sequences in the query database and all sequences in the target; database. mmseqs kmermatcher: finds exact k-mer matches between all input sequences in linear time. mmseqs align: Computes Smith-Waterman alignment scores between all; sequences in the query database and the sequences of the target; database whose prefiltering scores computed by mmseqs prefilter; pass a minimum threshold. mmseqs rescorediagonal: Computes 1D optimal score between all; sequences in the query ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the parameter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering Format. Updating a clustering database using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB cluDB_old newDB_updated cluDB_updated tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the corresponding clustering, and the new version of the sequence database.; Then it adds the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed in the new database. Sequences which are not similar enough to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; clusterupdate creates a new sequence database newDB_updated that has consistent identifiers with the previous sequence databases. Meaning, the same sequences in both sets will have the same numeric identifier. All modules afterwards (for example convertalis) expect this sequence database to be passed.; Taxonomy assignment. Terminology; An MMseqs2 database seqTaxDB is a sequence database augmented with taxonomic information and a mapping file from each database key to its taxon id. Such a database includes the following files:; seqTaxDB, seqTaxDB.index, seqTaxDB.dbtype, seqTaxDB.lookup, seqTax",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html

With --report-mode 1 an interactive Krona based taxonomy report can be created:; mmseqs taxonomyreport seqTaxDB taxonomyResult report.html --report-mode 1. The resulting report.html file can be opened in any modern web browser. It will look similar to the following screenshot:. Filtering taxonomy output; Other MMseqs2 modules work with taxonomyResult databases e.g. filtertaxdb can be used to extract taxa, addtaxonomy to augment a result database with taxonomic information.; Here is an example for using filtertaxdb to extract only results whose taxonomic assignment is any kind of virus (i.e., in the superkingdom ""viruses"").; mmseqs filtertaxdb seqTaxDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult.virus --taxon-list 10239; awk '$3 != 1 {print}' taxonomyResult.virus > taxonomyResult.virus.id; mmseqs createsubdb taxonomyResult.virus.id queryDB queryDB.virus; mmseqs createsubdb taxonomyResult.virus.id queryDB_h queryDB.virus_h. Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database; It is easy to create a seqTaxDB from a pre-existing local BLAST databases, if BLAST+ is installed. The following example creates an MMSeqs2 database from NCBI's nt database, but it also works with any of the other BLAST databases including the nr protein database.; First, manually download the NCBI taxonomy database dump:; wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz; mkdir taxonomy && tar -xxvf taxdump.tar.gz -C taxonomy. BLAST+'s blastdbcmd can be used to extract both the FASTA as well as the taxonomy mapping files:; blastdbcmd -db nt -entry all > nt.fna; blastdbcmd -db nt -entry all -outfmt ""%a %T"" > nt.fna.taxidmapping. Finally, the createdb and createtaxdb modules use the information to create a complete MMSeqs2 database:; mmseqs createdb nt.fna nt.fnaDB; mmseqs createtaxdb nt.fnaDB tmp --ncbi-tax-dump taxonomy/ --tax-mapping-file nt.fna.taxidmapping.

For very large databases (tens of; millions of sequences), it is a good advice to keep this number at; reasonable values (i.e. the default value 300). For considerably; larger values of --max-seqs, the size of the output can be in the; range of several TB of disk space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time of the prefilter. Decreasing can speed but alignment but might degrade the sensitivity; since the order of the prefilter can differ from the alignment. Alignment module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 2.0625E-4 seconds on one CPU. For example, computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge number of alignments has to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html

It is recommended to keep the index on a local hard; drive. If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than there are two solutions:. Load the index into main memory using the module touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch), MMseqs2 can be forced to use the main memory database by using the parameter --db-load-mode 3.

It will trigger a search similar to BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX respectively. The search uses the extractorfs module to detect all open reading frames (ORFs) on all six frames and translates them into proteins. Per default, MMseqs2 extracts all ORFs per frame starting from any codon until a stop codon occurs (--orf-start-mode 1) that are longer than 30 amino acid residues (--min-length 30).

Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence using gapped local sequence alignment.

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the parameter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering Format. Updating a clustering database using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB cluDB_old newDB_updated cluDB_updated tmp. This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the corresponding clustering, and the new version of the sequence database.; Then it adds the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed in the new database. Sequences which are not similar enough to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; clusterupdate creates a new sequence database newDB_updated that has consistent identifiers with the previous sequence databases. Meaning, the same sequences in both sets will have the same numeric identifier. All modules afterwards (for example convertalis) expect this sequence database to be passed.; Taxonomy assignment. Terminology; An MMseqs2 database seqTaxDB is a sequence database augmented with taxonomic information and a mapping file from each database key to its taxon id.

The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy calls an internal module lca that implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB. You can control the information provided about the lineage by using the tax-lineage parameter. The default mode is --tax-lineage 0 and does not include information about the ancestry of the assigned taxon. The mode --tax-lineage 1 will add a column with the full lineage names, prefixed with their short rank (e.g., -_cellular organisms;d_Eukaryota;...;g_Saccharomyces;s_Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mode --tax-lineage 2 will add a column with the full lineage NCBI taxids (e.g., 131567;2759;...;4930;4932):; mmseqs taxonomy queryDB seqTaxDB taxonomyResult tmp.

MMseqs2 can handle profiles or protein/nucleotide sequences as input for the; queryDB. The prefilter k-mer match stage is key to the high speed and; sensitivity. It detects consecutive short words (""k-mer"") match on the same diagonal. The diagonal of a k-mer match is the difference between the positions of the two similar ''k''-mer in the query and in the target sequence.; The pre-computed index table for the target database (blue frame) contains for each possible ''k''-mer the list of the target sequences and positions where the k-mer occurs (green frame).; Query sequences/profiles are processed one by one (loop 1). For each overlapping, spaced query k-mer (loop 2), a list of all similar k-mer is generated (orange frame). The similarity threshold determines the list length and sets the trade-off between speed and sensitivity. The similar k-mer list length can be controlled with -s.; For each similar k-mer (loop 3) we look up the list of sequences and positions where it occurs (green frame). In loop 4 we detect consecutive double matches on the same diagonals (magenta and black frames).; For each consecutive k-mer matches an ungapped alignment is computed.; Only the maximal ungapped alignment score for each target is reported.; Set sensitivity -s parameter; The sensitivity of the prefiltering can be set using the -s option.; Internally, -s sets the average length of the lists of similar; k-mers per query sequence position. Similar k-mers list length: Low sensitivity yields short similar; k-mer lists. Therefore, the speed of the prefiltering increases,; since only short k-mer lists have to be generated and less lookups; in the index table are necessary. However, the sensitivity of the; search decreases, since only very similar k-mers are generated and; therefore, the prefiltering cannot identify sequence pairs with low; sequence identity. It is possible to speed best hits searches by stepwise increasing -s.

It works like the map step from the map/reduce pattern. It calls for every index entry the specified process with the passed parameters. The process reads the entry data from stdin and its stdout is written to a new entry in the result database (with the same key). The tool supports OpenMP and MPI parallelization for spreading out the job over several compute nodes.; Example: An awk script which takes an alignment result entry from stdin and prints out all lines with an e-value <0.001 to stdout (Hint: the filterdb module can also solve this problem, but with less overhead):; mmseqs apply resultDB filteredResultDB -- awk '$4 < 0.001 { print; }'.

How to search small query sets fast; MMseqs2 can perform single queries fast if the whole index fits into memory by using memory-mapped file I/O (mmap). If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to load GBs from the hard disk for each query, which will take minutes. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; First we need to setup the database by creating a database with createdb, index it createindex and then load the index into memory touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch).; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp; mmseqs touchdb targetDB; # alternative using vmtouch; vmtouch -l -d -t targetDB.idx.

The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM.

Once the database is in memory it is possible to run instant searches against it by using the --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2; mmseqs convertalis queryDB targetDB aln aln.m8 --db-load-mode 2. The touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should be used for high identities which is more of a technical task rather than measuring homology. Therefore, we turned off compositional bias correction, we do not mask the database, search with low sensitivity -s 2 and we align only ungapped.; How to build your own MMseqs2 compatible substitution matrices; You can use the (still Work in Progress) R script in util/format_substitution_matrix.R to prepare a substitution matrix for use in MMseqs2.

Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'. The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy calls an internal module lca that implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB. You can control the information provided about the lineage by using the tax-lineage parameter. The default mode is --tax-lineage 0 and does not include information about the ancestry of the assigned taxon. The mode --tax-lineage 1 will add a column with the full lineage names, prefixed with their short rank (e.g., -_cellular organisms;d_Eukaryota;",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html

The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented.; By default, MMseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns of the first sequence except gaps '-' will be turned into profile columns.; This setting can be used for center star MSAs where the first sequence is the center.

Alignment module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 2.0625E-4 seconds on one CPU. For example, computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge number of alignments has to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops.; The results of the prefilter are aligned from highest ungapped alignment score to lowest.; We increase a rejection counter after each alignment that does not fulfill the alignment criteria such; coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. If the counter is greater than --max-rejected then it stops the; alignment and does not take a look at any furthe",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html

Convert stockholm MSAs to a FASTA formatted MSA database.; mmseqs convertmsa Pfam-A.full.gz pfam_msa_db. Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modeled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions.

A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre.

Sequence pairs that satisfy the clustering criteria (e.g. on the E-value, sequence similarity, and sequence coverage) are linked by an edge.; (5) The greedy incremental algorithm finds a clustering such that each input sequence has an edge to its cluster's representative sequence.

It works like the map step from the map/reduce pattern. It calls for every index entry the specified process with the passed parameters. The process reads the entry data from stdin and its stdout is written to a new entry in the result database (with the same key). The tool supports OpenMP and MPI parallelization for spreading out the job over several compute nodes.; Example: An awk script which takes an alignment result entry from stdin and prints out all lines with an e-value <0.001 to stdout (Hint: the filterdb module can also solve this problem, but with less overhead):; mmseqs apply resultDB filteredResultDB -- awk '$4 < 0.001 { print; }'. The apply module exports the MMSEQS_ENTRY_NAME environment variable into the called processes. It contains the current database key.; How to compute a multiple alignment for each cluster; There are two ways to produce MSAs from a clustering; (1) MMseqs2 mmseqs result2msa can produce an MSA using a centre star alignment without insertions in the query.; mmseqs cluster DB DB_clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB DB_clu DB_clu_msa.

Reciprocal best hit using mmseqs rbh. Given two protein sets 'A' and 'B', MMseqs2 can search in two directions and report pairs ('a','b'), such that 'b' is the highest scoring hit of 'a' and 'a' is the highest scoring hit of 'b':; mmseqs easy-rbh Aproteins.fasta Bproteins.fasta ABrbh tmp. Behind the scenes; The workflow searches with each 'a' against the targets in 'B'. It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of core modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility. Especially for the sequence search; it can be useful to adjust the prefiltering and alignment parameters; according to the needs of the user.; MMseqs2 contains three core modules: prefiltering, alignment and; clustering.; Computation of prefiltering scores using mmseqs prefilter.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time of the prefilter. Decreasing can speed but alignment but might degrade the sensitivity; since the order of the prefilter can differ from the alignment. Alignment module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 2.0625E-4 seconds on one CPU. For example, computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge number of alignments has to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops.; The results of the prefilter are aligned from highest ungapped alignment score to lowest.; We increase a rejection counter after each alignment that does not fulfill the alignment criteria such; coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. If the counter i",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html

Disk space; Since the alignment module takes the results of the prefiltering module; as input, the size of the prefiltering module output is the point of; reference. If all hits from the prefilter are accepted by the alignments than the disk space consumption is 1.75 times higher.; It needs roughly ~60 byte per record. The option -a adds the backtrace and there for increases the size to ~80 byte.; Clustering module; In the clustering module, only the memory consumption is a critical; issue.; Memory consumption; The clustering module can need large amounts of memory. The memory; consumption for a database containing N sequences and an average of; r alignment results per sequence can be estimated as; M = (6 * N * r) byte. To prevent excessive memory usage for the clustering of large databases,; MMseqs2 uses a cascaded clustering by default, which; accumulates sequences per cluster incrementally.; If you run the clustering module separately, you can tune the following; parameters:. --max-seqs parameter which controls the maximum number of; alignment results per query considered (i.e. the number of edges per; node in the graph). Lower value causes lower memory usage and faster; run times. Alternatively, -s parameter can be set to a higher value in order; to cluster the database down to higher sequence identities. Only the; alignment results above the sequence identity threshold are imported; and it results in lower memory usage. Runtime; Clustering is the fastest step. It needs less than an hour for the; clustering of the whole UniProtKB. The core algorithm of cluster mode --cluster-mode 0, 1, 2 runs single threaded; 3 runs multi threaded.; Disk space; Since only one record is written per cluster, the memory usage is a; small fraction of the memory usage in the prefiltering and alignment; modules.; Workflows; The resource requirements depend on the combination of modules.; Search uses the prefilter and alignment module.

The query coverage would be 6/6=100%.; How do parameters of CD-HIT relate to MMSeqs2; CD-HIT applies a greedy incremental clustering strategy (in MMseqs2 --cluster-mode 2) to cluster its sequences.

But it is possible to mimic the results by applying alignment coverage --cov-mode X -c 0.X in CD-HIT -aS, -aL, -A.; -c 0.XX -> --min-seq-id 0.XX ; -T X -> --threads X; -M -> --split-memory-limit ; -G 0 -> MMseqs2 uses local alignments is the default, there is no way to make alignments global; -n -> -k (MMseqs2 optimizes the k-mer length automatically); -s 0.X -> --cov-mode 4 -c 0.X; -aL 0.X -> --cov-mode 2 -c 0.X; -aS 0.X -> --cov-mode 1 -c 0.X; -A 0.X -> --cov-mode 0 -c 0.X; -g 1 -> it is not possible with MMseqs2 using greedy incremental clustering (needed for --cov-mode 1/2). However, setcover assigns sequence to the best matching representative in default. ; -r 1 -> MMseqs2 in default considers forward and reverse strand. How does MMseqs2 compute the sequence identity; MMseqs2 computes the sequence identity in two different ways:; (1) When using --alignment-mode 3 MMseqs2 will compute the number of identical aligned residues divided by the number of aligned columns including columns containing a gap in either sequence.; (2) By default, the sequence identity is estimated from the score per column, i.e., the local alignment bit score divided by the maximum length of the two aligned sequence segments.

If you change the parameters of the command call than the whole result is recomputed. We have a flag called --force-reuse to use the last temporary results also if parameters are changed.; How to control the speed of the search; There are several parameters to improve the search speed. Here is a list of the most important ones:. -s controls how many similar k-mers should be produced during the seeding stage. This is the most important parameter for speed, a lower value is fast but less sensitive and a higher one is sensitive but slower. The default search is already sensitive (default: 5.7). --exact-kmer-matching turns off similar k-mer generation and performs only an exact k-mer search (default: false). --max-accept controls how many hits should be accepted by the alignment out of --max-seqs (default: 300) prefilter hits. Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit was accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the prefiltering. This however would also allow more sequences to pass the prefiltering stage (default: true). --min-ungapped-score the minimum score a prefilter hit in the ungapped alignment stage requires to pass to the alignment stage (default: 15).

How to find the best hit the fastest way; MMseqs2 can apply an iterative approach to speed up best-hit-searches. It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The number of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low. Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common. This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used (--start-sens 4).; If any hit is good enough add the --max-accept 1 option to gain a further speedup.; How does MMseqs2 handle low complexity; MMseqs2 uses tantan to reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction.

How to create a HHblits database; One can turn the output of a search (or clustering) into a HHblits database. You need to have HH-suite properly installed with MPI support. The following procedure creates an HHblits-compatible database ""searchMsa"" resulting from the enrichment of sequences of ""DBquery"" with the sequences of ""DBtarget"":; mmseqs search DBquery DBtarget searchOut tmp -a; mmseqs result2msa DBquery DBtarget searchOut searchMsa --compress; # MPI version ; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b; # no MPI version ; cstranslate -i searchMsa -o searchMsa_cs219 -f -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b. The files /path/to/cs219.lib and /path/to/context_data.lib are provided in the ""data"" subfolder of your HH-suite installation. The parameters -x 0.3 -c 4 have been empirically found to perform well.; For creating an HHblits database from a clustering, the procedure is almost the same, except that you have to create symlinks to the ffindex _header and _sequence files needed by HHblits:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp; mmseqs result2msa DB DB clu cluMsa --compress; ln -s DB_h cluMsa_header.ffdata; ln -s DB_h.index cluMsa_header.ffindex; ln -s DB cluMsa_sequence.ffdata; ln -s DB.index cluMsa_sequence.ffindex; mpirun -np 2 cstranslate_mpi -i cluMsa -o cluMsa_cs219 -A /path/to/cs219.lib -D /path/to/context_data.lib -x 0.3 -c 4 -I ca3m -b.

The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements a; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to full capacity. Due to its; unparalleled combination of speed and sensitivity, searches of all; predicted ORFs in large metagenomics data sets through the entire; UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases are feasible. This allows for; assigning to functional clusters and taxonomic clades many reads that; are too diverged to be mappable by current software.; MMseqs2 clustering module can cluster sequence sets efficiently into; groups of similar sequences. It takes as input the similarity graph; obtained from the comparison of the sequence set with itself in the; prefiltering and alignment modules. MMseqs2 further supports an updating; mode in which sequences can be added to an existing clustering with; stable cluster identifiers and without the need to recluster the entire; sequence set.

If storing the index file on a local hard drive is not possible; and the NFS is a bottleneck than there are two solutions:. Load the index into main memory using the module touchdb or vmtouch (https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch), MMseqs2 can be forced to use the main memory database by using the parameter --db-load-mode 3.

The msa2profile decide if a column of the multiple sequence alignment will be considered in the profile or not. There are two different modes. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented.; By default, MMseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns of the first sequence except gaps '-' will be turned into profile columns.; This setting can be used for center star MSAs where the first sequence is the center. It is risky for large MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire MSA.; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions.

Write temporary files to local disk when running with MPI; As part of its computation, MMseqs2 writes temporary files corresponding to each of the database splits. The number of the database splits is determined by the number of servers and number of cores in each server. By default, temporary files are written to the shared disk.; In case the number of database splits is large, it would mean a high burden of I/O operations on the same disk.

You can recognize the temporary files that should be deleted by their file ending .[0-9]+.; If the job crashed while merging files they can be merged manually using ffindex_build (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).

Setting a limit will increase the speed of the alignment (default: 2^15). --max-rejected aligns until N consecutive alignments are rejected and stops. The rejected counter is reset after a hit was accepted (default: 2^15). --diag-score this decides if ungapped alignment scoring is enabled. For highly redundant database it can make sense to turn off the ungapped alignment to speed up the prefiltering. This however would also allow more sequences to pass the prefiltering stage (default: true). --min-ungapped-score the minimum score a prefilter hit in the ungapped alignment stage requires to pass to the alignment stage (default: 15).

In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. We use TANTAN with a threshold of 90% probability for low complexity.

Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modeled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment) .; We compute sequence profiles from the FASTA MSAs using; mmseqs msa2profile pfam_msa_db pfam_profile --match-mode 1.

Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence u",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/944600a19ec4d329c9a45c19b1a881839102709d.html

Similar k-mers list length: Low sensitivity yields short similar; k-mer lists. Therefore, the speed of the prefiltering increases,; since only short k-mer lists have to be generated and less lookups; in the index table are necessary. However, the sensitivity of the; search decreases, since only very similar k-mers are generated and; therefore, the prefiltering cannot identify sequence pairs with low; sequence identity. It is possible to speed best hits searches by stepwise increasing -s. MMseqs2 includes a workflow for this purpose. How to find the best hit the fastest way; The following graphic shows the average AUC sensitivity versus speed-up factor relative to BLAST for 637,000 test searches. White numbers in plot symbols give number of search iterations. It is furthermore possible to use change the k-mer lengths, which are; used in the prefiltering. Longer k-mers are more sensitive, since they; cause less chance matches. Though longer k-mers only pay off for; larger databases, since more time is needed for the k-mer list; generation, but less time for database matching.

This can be useful in combination with the -mtune/-march/-mcpu flags of GCC/Clang if you know exactly what system your binary will later run on.; We use the ips4o sorting library, which requires atomic compare exchange instructions for 16-byte/128-bit values (cmpxchg16b on x64).; If your system does not have reliable support for this instruction you can disable the use of this library with -DDISABLE_IPS4O=1. Usually MMseqs2 automatically enables/disables ips4o depending on the system and this flag should not be changed.; The MMseqs2 version string, which is printed in help texts and by the version module, can be changed with the -DVERSION_OVERRIDE parameter. This is useful for packaging MMseqs2 to e.g. set a custom suffix for the distribution name. Please use this parameter, if you are packaging MMseqs2 for distribution. This will help us troubleshoot potential issues.; The -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 parameter enables additional build types for debugging MMseqs2.

Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are shell scripts chaining elementary MMseqs2 module and other workflows together. A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h.

Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps. This time, the prefiltering is executed with a higher; sensitivity and a lower result significance threshold for catching; sequence pairs with lower sequence identity. In the last step, the whole; process is repeated again with the final target sensitivity. At last,; the clustering results are merged and the resulting clustering is; written to the output database.; Cascaded clustering is performed in default because of its increase in speed.; Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment. Computing an exhaustive all against all distance matrix would take too much hard-disk. However it is possible to perform a single step clustering using --single-step-clustering.; Cascaded clustering has many advantages but comes with one caveat. Since the representative of a cluster can change with every iteration it can happen that some members that were already close to a clustering do not fulfill the clustering criteria anymore. However, we can correct this by reassigning the sequences. To active the reassignment use --cluster-reassign. This mode removes sequences from the cascaded cluster result that do not fulfill the cluster criteria and reassigns them (if possible) to a different cluster.; Clustering modes; All clustering modes transform the alignment results into an undirected graph.

Terminology; An MMseqs2 database seqTaxDB is a sequence database augmented with taxonomic information and a mapping file from each database key to its taxon id. Such a database includes the following files:; seqTaxDB, seqTaxDB.index, seqTaxDB.dbtype, seqTaxDB.lookup, seqTaxDB_h, seqTaxDB_h.index, seqTaxDB_h.dbtype, seqTaxDB_mapping, seqTaxDB_nodes.dmp, seqTaxDB_names.dmp, seqTaxDB_merged.dmp.; As detailed in the following sections, there are several ways to create and manipulate a seqTaxDB. Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; The databases module provides a easy way to download and setup taxonomy; databases that we predefined (see Downloading databases). Follow this section to learn how to manually create a seqTaxDB.; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot idmapping and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier. By default, createtaxdb downloads the Uniprot id mapping file (idmapping.dat.gz), and thus only supports Uniprot identifiers.; If your seqTaxDB does not contain Uniprot ids or you wish to provide an alternative source for the taxonomic information, please follow the instructions here:.

For searching a database, query and target database have to be converted; by createdb in order to use them in MMseqs. The search can be executed; by typing:; $ mmseqs search queryDB targetDB outDB tmp. MMseqs2 supports iterative searches which are similar to PSI-BLAST. The; following program call will run two iterations through the database. In; the first iteration sequences are searched against sequence and in the; second one profiles are used to search against sequences.; MMseqs2 will use the output for the first iteration sequence-sequence; search to computes a profile (result2profile). The profile will be used; as input in the next search iteration.; $ mmseqs search queryDB targetDB outDB tmp --num-iterations 2.

All open reading frames (ORFs) from all six frames are; extracted with extractorf. These ORFs are translated into proteins; by translatenucs. The tool offsetalignment will offset the alignment position to the orf start position + alignment start * 3.; Mapping Very Similar Sequences using mmseqs map. The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database. First it calls the prefilter module (with a low sensitivity setting) to detect high scoring diagonals and then computes an ungapped alignment with the rescorediagonal module. In contrast to the normal search, for maximum speed no gapped alignment is computed, query sequences are not masked for low complexity regions and no compositional bias correction is applied.; $ mmseqs map queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. MMseqs2 will provide a sorted (by E-value) list of best matches in resultDB. The best hit can be extracted with:; $ mmseqs filterdb queryDB targetDB resultDB bestResultDB --extract-lines 1. The format of resultDB is the same as in alignment format of the normal search workflow. The mapping workflow can also be used in iterative-best-hit mode, where each query that does not find any match is searched with higher sensitivity again.; If either queryDB or targetDB is a nucleotide sequence database, MMseqs2 will use the translated sequence search mode described above.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster or mmseqs linclust.

Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes).

You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test the search workflow:; $ mmseqs createdb examples/QUERY.fasta queryDB; $ mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB. These calls should generates five files each, e.g. queryDB,; queryDB_h and its corresponding index file queryDB.index,; queryDB_h.index and queryDB.lookup from the FAS",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9651b2c14f023d7dc3d4bfdc9e5a83f81c0bdbbf.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9651b2c14f023d7dc3d4bfdc9e5a83f81c0bdbbf.html

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering Format.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate.

This workflow efficiently updates the clustering of a database by adding; new and removing outdated sequences. It takes as input the older; sequence database, the corresponding clustering, and the new version of the sequence database.; Then it adds the new sequences to the clustering and removes the sequences that were; removed in the new database. Sequences which are not similar enough to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; clusterupdate creates a new sequence database newDB_updated that has consistent identifiers with the previous sequence databases.

The option --max-seqscontrols the maximum number of prefiltering; results per query sequence. For very large databases (tens of; millions of sequences), it is a good advice to keep this number at; reasonable values (i.e. the default value 300). For considerably; larger values of --max-seqs, the size of the output can be in the; range of several TB of disk space for databases containing tens of; millions of sequences. Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time but can degrade the sensitivity. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module.

The program outputs for; each query sequence all database sequences satisfying the search; criteria (such as sensitivity).; MMseqs2 can precompute the prefilter index createindex to speed up; subsequence prefilter index read-ins. We recommend to use an index for; iterative searches or if a target database will be reused several times.; However reading the index can be bottle neck when using a network file; systems (NFS).

Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and by gapless local alignment extending the k-mer match.; (4) Sequences above a score cut-off in step 3 are aligned to their centre sequence using gapped local sequence alignment.

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to set the number of k-mers selected per sequence. More k-mers per sequences results in a higher sensitivity.; The output format of linclust is the same format as in mmseqs cluster. See section Clustering Format.; Updating a Database Clustering using mmseqs clusterupdate. To run the updating, you need the old and the new version of your; sequence database in sequence db format, the clustering of the old database; version and a directory for the temporary files:; $ mmseqs clusterupdate oldDB newDB cluDB_old newDB_updated cluDB_updated tmp.

The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub.

Changing --max-seqs option has no effect on; the run time but can degrade the sensitivity. Alignment Module; In the alignment module, generally only the total runtime and disk space; are the critical issues.; Memory Consumption; The major part of the memory is required for the three dynamic; programming matrices, once per core. Since most sequences are quite; short, the memory requirements of the alignment module for a typical; database are in the order of a few GB.; Runtime; The alignment is based on a striped vectorized algorithm which can; process roughly 2 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS). The time to; compute the alignment of two average sized proteins (350 residues) takes; roughly 6.0625E-5 seconds on one CPU. For example computing 23 Mio.; alignments on 8 cores takes 2 minutes.; If a huge amount of alignments have to be calculated, the run time of; the alignment module can become a bottleneck. The run time of the; alignment module depends essentially on two parameters:. The option --max-seqs controls the maximum number of sequences; aligned with a query sequence. By setting this parameter to a lower; value, you accelerate the program, but you may also lose some; meaningful results. Since the prefiltering results are always; ordered by their significance, the most significant prefiltering; results are always aligned first in the alignment module. The option --max-accept controls the maximum number of alignment; results per query sequence. The option --max-rejected defines the maximum number of rejected; sequences for a query until the calculation of alignments stops. A; reject is an alignment whose statistics don’t satisfy the search; criteria such as coverage threshold, e-value threshold etc. Per; default, --max-rejected is set to INT_MAX, i.e. all alignments; until --max-seqs alignments are calculated.

Convert stockholm MSAs to a FASTA formatted MSA database.; mmseqs convertmsa Pfam-A.full.gz pfam_msa_db. Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modeled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequence might be not very representative of the entire family. A better choice for Pfam is therefore; --match-mode 1 (profile column assignment by gap fraction); which turns all columns with at least 50% residues (non-gaps) to profile columns and treats all others as insertions. The threshold ratio can be changed with the option; --match-ratio 0.5 (change gap fraction threshold for profile column assignment) .; We compute sequence profiles from the FASTA MSAs using; mmseqs msa2profile pfam",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9651b2c14f023d7dc3d4bfdc9e5a83f81c0bdbbf.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9651b2c14f023d7dc3d4bfdc9e5a83f81c0bdbbf.html

Cluster member are assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre. It thereby tends to select the same sequences as centre among groups sharing sequences.; (3) It merges k-mer groups with the same centre sequence together:; red + cyan and orange + blue and compares each group member to the centre sequence in two steps: by global Hamming distance and ",MatchSource.WIKI,Home/9651b2c14f023d7dc3d4bfdc9e5a83f81c0bdbbf.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9651b2c14f023d7dc3d4bfdc9e5a83f81c0bdbbf.html

Sequence pairs that satisfy the clustering criteria (e.g. on the E-value, sequence similarity, and sequence coverage) are linked by an edge.; (5) The greedy incremental algorithm finds a clustering such that each input sequence has an edge to its cluster's representative sequence. Note that the number of sequence pairs compared in steps 3 and 4 is less than mN, resulting in a linear time complexity.; Run Linclust; Linclust needs a sequence database created by createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp.
