NOTE: Not all zones are equipped with GPUs, so if you want to use GPUs for your; project, please take note of the availability listing; [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/). To verify that the installation and authentication succeeded, run. ```shell; gcloud auth list; ```. and verify that your account email address is printed. ## Starting a Compute Engine instance. A simple way to access compute on GCP is Google Compute Engine. Compute Engine; instances can be sized to meet computational and storage needs for your project. Before we get started, [ensure you have adequate quota; provisioned](https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas) so that you can get all; the CPUs/GPUs that you need. To start with, you might want to request quota for; 64 CPUs and 2 GPUs in your zone. DeepVariant can make use of multiple CPU cores and (currently, a single) GPU; device. For this ""quick start"" guide, let's allocate an 8-core non-preemptible; instance in your default zone with a single GPU, running Ubuntu 20.04, with a; disk of reasonable size for modest work with genomic data. From our local; command line, we do:. ```shell; gcloud beta compute instances create ""${USER}-deepvariant-quickstart"" \; --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \; --image-family ubuntu-2004-lts --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \; --machine-type n1-standard-8 \; --boot-disk-size=200GB \; --zone us-west1-b \; --accelerator type=nvidia-tesla-k80,count=1 --maintenance-policy TERMINATE --restart-on-failure; ```. NOTE: To create an instance *without GPU*, simply omit the last line from the; command. Check that the instance has been created and started:. ```shell; gcloud compute instances list; ```. which should produce output like:. ```; NAME ZONE MACHINE_TYPE PREEMPTIBLE INTERNAL_IP EXTERNAL_IP STATUS; [USER]-deepvariant-quickstart us-west1-b n1-standard-8 10.138.0.4 35.185.203.59 RUNNING; ```.

The DeepVariant team has been hard at work since we first presented the method.; Key changes and improvements include:. * Rearchitected with open source release in mind; * Built on [TensorFlow]; * Increased variant calling accuracy, especially for indels; * Vastly faster with reduced memory usage. We have made a number of improvements to the methodology as well. The biggest; change was to move away from RGB-encoded (3-channel) pileup images and instead; represent the aligned read data using a multi-channel tensor data layout. We; currently represent the data as a 6-channel raw tensor in which we encode:. * The read base (A, C, G, T); * The base's quality score; * The read's mapping quality score; * The read's strand (positive or negative); * Does the read support the allele being evaluated?; * Does the base match the reference genome at this position?. These are all readily derived from the information found in the BAM file; encoding of each read. Additional modeling changes were to move to the inception-v3 architecture and to; train on many more independent sequencing replicates of the ground truth; training samples, including 50% downsampled versions of each of those read sets.; In our te

Energy Efficiency,"is; important to first determine whether a candidate variant was proposed by; DeepVariant. A potential variant requires at least 2 reads to support a variant; and a minimum fraction of reads supporting the variant (0.12 for SNPs and PacBio; Indels, 0.06 for Illumina Indels). All sites that have been generated as; candidates are written in the VCF file, so if you do not see a row in the VCF; file for the variant in question, it means that a candidate was not made.; However, within these sites certain possible alleles may have been pruned in; reporting. To see all alleles, you may add: `--debug_output_all_candidates=ALT`; in the postprocess_variants step. To increase the sensitivity of DeepVariant to these sites, you may add the; following parameters, here shown with their defaults:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""vsc_min_count_snps=2,vsc_min_fraction_snps=0.12,vsc_min_count_indels=2,vsc_min_fraction_indels=0.06""; ```. It is sometimes also the case that realignment of the reads within DeepVariant; changes or reduces the evidence supporting the variant. To check for this, try; using the `--norealign_reads` flag to turn off realignment temporarily. Note; that we don't recommend turning off the realigner for Illumina data in general; cases because the realigner improves accuracy overall. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. See the ""What is the realigner and how does it work?"" section; for instructions. **Missing variants where a candidate is generated:**. If a candidate is made, but is called as reference (either 0/0 or ./.) it means; that the neural network processed the genomic region, but based on all of its; learned experience from training data, it decided the highest probability for; the position was as non-variant. Some of the reasons that DeepVariant may; suspect a false positive are: strand-bias in reads, low mapping quality in; reads, low base quality in reads, and overall low coverage.

**Content to evaluate:**  
is; important to first determine whether a candidate variant was proposed by; DeepVariant. A potential variant requires at least 2 reads to support a variant; and a minimum fraction of reads supporting the variant (0.12 for SNPs and PacBio; Indels, 0.06 for Illumina Indels). All sites that have been generated as; candidates are written in the VCF file, so if you do not see a row in the VCF; file for the variant in question, it means that a candidate was not made.; However, within these sites certain possible alleles may have been pruned in; reporting. To see all alleles, you may add: `--debug_output_all_candidates=ALT`; in the postprocess_variants step. To increase the sensitivity of DeepVariant to these sites, you may add the; following parameters, here shown with their defaults:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""vsc_min_count_snps=2,vsc_min_fraction_snps=0.12,vsc_min_count_indels=2,vsc_min_fraction_indels=0.06""; ```. It is sometimes also the case that realignment of the reads within DeepVariant; changes or reduces the evidence supporting the variant. To check for this, try; using the `--norealign_reads` flag to turn off realignment temporarily. Note; that we don't recommend turning off the realigner for Illumina data in general; cases because the realigner improves accuracy overall. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. See the ""What is the realigner and how does it work?"" section; for instructions. **Missing variants where a candidate is generated:**. If a candidate is made, but is called as reference (either 0/0 or ./.) it means; that the neural network processed the genomic region, but based on all of its; learned experience from training data, it decided the highest probability for; the position was as non-variant. Some of the reasons that DeepVariant may; suspect a false positive are: strand-bias in reads, low mapping quality in; reads, low base quality in reads, and overall low coverage. In additi

It is a mix of technical jargon and step-by-step instructions, but does not contain any discussion that would be considered subjective or based on personal opinions or experiences.

Energy Efficiency,"nally, each read is then realigned to its most likely; > haplotype. This procedure updates both the position and the CIGAR string for; > each read. Local realignment is not performed for long reads (PacBio, and other similar; technologies). The realigner step can optionally be switched off using; `--norealign_reads`. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. This can be done by passing the following parameters:; `--make_examples_extra_args=""emit_realigned_reads=true,realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads""`. Note that this is meant for debugging and produces a bam file for every; candidate variant, which can result in millions of tiny bam files, so when using; this, narrow down the DeepVariant run using `--regions` to just the variants you; want to inspect more closely. ## How are `AD` and `DP` values calculated?. In order to efficiently perform variant calling, DeepVariant partitions the; genome into chunks (set by `--partition_size`), and will read in a max number of; reads into each partition (set by `--max_reads_per_partition`). By default,; `--partition_size` is set to 1000 and `--max_reads_per_partition` is set to; 1500. The `AD` and `DP` values are based on the read depths constrained by; `--max_reads_per_partition`. For example, if you have a depth of 2000x at a given site, DeepVariant will; subsample 1500 reads, and `DP` or `AD` will be capped at 1500. If you want to; calculate the true `AD` and `DP` values at high-depth regions, you can set; `--max_reads_per_partition=0` to calculate `AD` and `DP` using all reads. In; practice, capping reads per partition reduces runtimes with little/no impact on; accuracy. ## Missing variant calls near the edge of a contig.

The output here is a TFRecord of; CallVariantsOutput protos. `call_variants` doesn't directly support sharding its; outputs, but accepts a glob or shard-pattern for its inputs. `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and uses TensorFlow for evaluation.; When evaluating a model in CPU mode, TensorFlow can make use of multiple cores,; but scaling is sub-linear. In other words, `call_variants` on a 64 core machine; is less than 8x faster than running on a 8 core machine. When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs; fewer CPUs. Based on a small number of experiments, currently the most efficient; configuration for `call_variants` on a GPU instance is 4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU.; Compared to our setting in the [whole genome case study], we noticed a 2.5x; speedup on the call_variants step using a single P100 GPU and 8 CPUs. Note that; currently `call_variants` can only use one GPU at most. So it doesn't improve; the speed if you get a multiple-GPU machine. ### postprocess_variants. `postprocess_variants` reads all of the output TFRecord files from; `call_variants`, sorts them, combines multi-allelic records, and writes out a; VCF file. When [gVCF output](deepvariant-gvcf-support.md) is requested, it also; outputs a gVCF file which merges the VCF with the non-variant sites. Because `postprocess_variants` combines and sorts the output of `call_variants`,; it needs to see all of the outputs from `call_variants` for a single sample to; merge into a final VCF. `postprocess_varia

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepVariant in one command. Starting from the 0.8 release, we introduced one convenient command that will; run through all 3 steps that are required to go from a BAM file to the VCF/gVCF; output files. You can still read about the r0.7 approach in; [Quick Start in r0.7]. If you want to compile the DeepVariant binaries for yourself, we also have a; [Dockerfile] that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the; [docker build] documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start running, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. An aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its corresponding index file; (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a sequencing instrument,; using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; DATA_HTTP_DIR=""https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/quickstart-testdata"". mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam.bai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.bed; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz; wget -P ${INPUT_D

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepVariant in one command. Starting from the 0.8 release, we introduced one convenient command that will; run through all 3 steps that are required to go from a BAM file to the VCF/gVCF; output files. You can still read about the r0.7 approach in; [Quick Start in r0.7]. If you want to compile the DeepVariant binaries for yourself, we also have a; [Dockerfile] that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the; [docker build] documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start running, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. An aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its corresponding index file; (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a sequencing instrument,; using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; DATA_HTTP_DIR=""https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/quickstart-testdata"". mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20

This is a step-by-step guide, likely intended for testing the functionality of a software tool. The presence of specific commands (like `sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io;`) indicates an installation procedure, followed by pulling a Docker image and downloading test data. These steps are typical of a testing scenario where the goal is to validate that the system under test can be set up and run correctly.

Now that we have performed training, we can test the performance of the new; model using our holdout dataset (chr20). The following one-step command can be used to call DeepVariant and run our newly; trained model:. ```bash; sudo docker run --gpus all \; -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \; ""${DOCKER_IMAGE}-gpu"" \; run_deepvariant \; --model_type WGS \; --customized_model ""${BEST_CHECKPOINT}"" \; --ref ""${REF}"" \; --reads ""${BAM_CHR20}"" \; --regions ""chr20"" \; --output_vcf ""${OUTPUT_DIR}/test_set.vcf.gz"" \; --num_shards=${N_SHARDS}; ```.

So we don't need; to add it in `--make_examples_extra_args`. When the `call_variants` step is run, you might see messages like:. ```; E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros.

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

Testability,"# DeepVariant support for variant calling in chromosome X and Y. ## Case study. A case study on how to use the parameters mentioned here are described in; [DeepVariant X, Y calling case study](deepvariant-xy-calling-case-study.md). ## Haploid calling support. As DeepVariant is a diploid variant caller, it assigns genotypes as {Hom-ref,; Het, Hom-alt} for each candidate allele it observes. For samples with karyotype; XY, the chromosome X and Y are effectively haploid. So, we are introducing two; flags to re-adjust the genotypes in regions that are considered to be haploid; for those samples. You can use `--haploid_contigs` and `--par_regions_bed` parameters to readjust; the genotypes in haploid regions. For samples with XY karyotype, it is expected; that users will set `--haploid_contigs=""chrX,chrY""` for; [GRCh38](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fa); and `--haploid_contigs=""X,Y""` for; [GRCh37](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/hs37d5.fa).; You can also provide a PAR region bed file with; `--par_regions_bed=""/input/GRCh3X_par.bed""` parameter.

The genotype re-adjustment is implemented in the `postprocess_variants` stage of; DeepVariant. For any variant, that is in the`--haploid_contigs` regions and; **not** in the `--par_regions_bed` regions, the genotype likelihoods of; heterozygous variants are set as 0 and the genotypes are normalized again after; re-adjusting the likelihoods. After that the most-likely genotype is assigned to; the allele which excludes any heterozygous calls.

# DeepVariant support for variant calling in chromosome X and Y. ## Case study. A case study on how to use the parameters mentioned here are described in; [DeepVariant X, Y calling case study](deepvariant-xy-calling-case-study.md). ## Haploid calling support. As DeepVariant is a diploid variant caller, it assigns genotypes as {Hom-ref,; Het, Hom-alt} for each candidate allele it observes. For samples with karyotype; XY, the chromosome X and Y are effectively haploid. So, we are introducing two; flags to re-adjust the genotypes in regions that are considered to be haploid; for those samples. You can use `--haploid_contigs` and `--par_regions_bed` parameters to readjust; the genotypes in haploid regions. For samples with XY karyotype, it is expected; that users will set `--haploid_contigs=""chrX,chrY""` for; [GRCh38](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fa); and `--haploid_contigs=""X,Y""` for; [GRCh37](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/hs37d5.fa).; You can also provide a PAR region bed file with; `--par_regions_bed=""/input/GRCh3X_par.bed""` parameter. The regions in the PAR; bed file will be skipped from genotype readjustment. You can download the PAR; bed files from here:; [GRCh38_par.bed](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/GRCh38_PAR.bed),; [GRCh37_par.bed](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/GRCh37_PAR.bed). ## How it works. The genotype re-adjustment is implemented in the `postprocess_variants` stage of; DeepVariant. For any variant, that is in the`--haploid_contigs` regions and; **not** in the `--par_regions_bed` regions, the genotype likelihoods of; heterozygous variants are set as 0 and the genotypes are normalized again after; re-adjusting the likelihoods. After that the most-likely genotype is assigned to; the allele which excludes any heterozygous calls. For example, suppose we observe an alternate allele `ALT1`

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

At the end of the output of that last command, you should see a summary message; like ""Executed 55 out of 55 tests: 55 tests pass."" along with the message; ""Target //deepvariant:binaries up-to-date:"" followed by a list of the just-built; deepvariant binaries. ## Preparing a machine to run DeepVariant. The following command should be run on any machine on which you wish run; DeepVariant, since there are runtime dependencies, such as Python packages like; numpy and Tensorflow to be installed:. ```shell; ./run-prereq.sh; ```. ## Configuring the build. Advanced users may want to edit the settings.sh file before building. It; contains options for configuring TensorFlow, CUDA, GPU usage, etc.;

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Transition (Ti) count is the number of biallelic SNPs going from purine->purine; or pyrimidine->pyrimidine, where purines are A and G, pyrimidines are C and T.; Transversions (Tv) are purine->pyrimidine or pyrimidine->purine. Transitions; are biologically more likely to occur than transversions due to the molecular; structure of the bases, so a ratio well above one is desirable. This; [article](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/6308/evaluating-the-quality-of-a-variant-callset); on the GATK forums has a good discussion of how to interpret the ratio. These; include all biallelic SNPs, excluding RefCalls. ### Biallelic indel size distribution. The sizes of all biallelic insertions and deletions are shown as histograms. The; top and bottom plots show the same data, just on a linear scale on top and on a; log scale on the bottom. RefCalls and multi-allelic variants are not included. ## Examples. ### WGS case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of WGS HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/WGS_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png). ### WES case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of WES HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/WES_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png). ### PacBio case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of PacBio HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/PacBio_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

We will be using GRCh38 for this case study. ```bash; FTPDIR=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids. curl ${FTPDIR}/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz | gunzip > reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta; curl ${FTPDIR}/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.fai > reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta.fai; ```. ### Download Genome in a Bottle Benchmarks. We will benchmark our variant calls against v4.2.1 of the Genome in a Bottle; small variant benchmarks for HG005. We will also restrict analysis to CDS; regions on chromosome 20 to make this demonstration quicker. The benchmarks consist of a bedfile containing confident regions, a VCF of; 'true' variants, and a VCF index. ```bash; FTPDIR=ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/ChineseTrio/HG005_NA24631_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38. curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed; curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz; curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz.tbi > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz.tbi; ```. ### Download and extract a CDS bedfile. Next, we will download a [gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) gff3; annotation and extract a bed file of chr20 CDS regions. ```bash; curl -L https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_41/gencode.v41.basic.annotation.gff3.gz > dat

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass.

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**  
Start in r0.7]. If you want to compile the DeepVariant binaries for yourself, we also have a; [Dockerfile] that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the; [docker build] documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start running, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. An aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its corresponding index file; (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a sequencing instrument,; using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; DATA_HTTP_DIR=""https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/quickstart-testdata"". mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam.bai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.bed; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz.tbi; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.fai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz.fai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz.gzi; ```.

Testability,"T TC,<*> 50 . . GT:GQ 0/1:50; 1 4390 . C <*> . . END=4390 GT:GQ 0/0:3; ```. ## Creating gVCF output with DeepVariant. The exact same three programs (`make_examples`, `call_variants`, and; `postprocess_variants`) are used when creating gVCF output as in the [WGS case; study]. However, additional flags must be passed to the `make_examples` and; `postprocess_variants` steps. ### `make_examples`. The `make_examples` program is where the gVCF records are computed. One additional flag is required in `make_examples`, the `--gvcf <filename>`; flag. This specifies an additional output, which is a TFRecord file of Variant; protocol buffers. If running with multiple processes, the sharding applied to; this output filename must be the same as that applied to the `--examples`; output. A concrete example call, using variables defined in the [WGS case study]:. ```bash; GVCF_TFRECORDS=""${OUTPUT_DIR}/HG002.gvcf.tfrecord@${N_SHARDS}.gz"". ( time seq 0 $((N_SHARDS-1)) | \; parallel --halt 2 --joblog ""${LOG_DIR}/log"" --res ""${LOG_DIR}"" \; python ""${BIN_DIR}""/make_examples.zip \; --mode calling \; --ref ""${REF}"" \; --reads ""${BAM}"" \; --examples ""${EXAMPLES}"" \; --gvcf ""${GVCF_TFRECORDS}"" \; --task {}; ) >""${LOG_DIR}/make_examples.log"" 2>&1`; ```. NOTE: gVCF outputs are only valid when `make_examples` is run in ""calling"" mode;; if attempted to run in ""training"" mode the program will exit and notify the user; of the error. ### `postprocess_variants`. When run in gVCF mode, the `postprocess_variants` program handles the creation; of the final gVCF file that incorporates both the non-variant records and the; true variants discovered by the previous programs. Two additional flags are required in `postprocess_variants`, the input; `--nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path <filename>` which corresponds to the TFRecord; of Variant protocol buffers created in `make_examples`, and the output; `--gvcf_outfile <filename>` which is the final gVCF output.

For the models we've released over time, you can find more details about the; training data in; [DeepVariant training data](deepvariant-details-training-data.md). ## CRAM support. As of v0.7, DeepVariant accepts CRAM files as input in addition to BAM files. As of v0.9.0, we changed the default to use the reference file specified by the; `--ref` flag, instead of the path to the original reference in the CRAM file; (encoded in the file's ""UR"" tag). For more information about CRAM, see the; [`samtools` documentation](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) in general; but particularly the sections on; [Global Options](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#GLOBAL_OPTIONS) and; [reference sequences in CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#REFERENCE_SEQUENCES). `htslib` also hosts a nice page; [benchmarking CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/CRAM.html) with information; on the effect of different CRAM options on file size and encoding/decoding; performance. Here are some basic file size and runtime numbers for running a single; `make_examples` job on a 30x whole genome sample in BAM and CRAM format.

Optionally; (`--realign_reads`) do a local assembly of the reads and realign the reads; to the resulting haplotype graph. 2. Find candidates: Catalogue all the putative alternate alleles for all those; reads, and compare the accumulated evidence for each alt against thresholds; (see `--vsc_min*` parameters for the thresholds). 3. Make pileup images: Represent the reads as a; [pileup image tensor](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2020-02-20-looking-through-deepvariants-eyes/).; When `--alt_aligned_pileup` is enabled, those alignments are included in; this ste

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``.

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros.

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that:
- Does not primarily match any of the elimination criteria
- Serves an informative, descriptive, or communicative purpose
- Appears to be intended for human understanding, regardless of subject matter or style
