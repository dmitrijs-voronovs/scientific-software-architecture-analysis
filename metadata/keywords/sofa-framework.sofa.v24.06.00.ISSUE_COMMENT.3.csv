I would expect the opposite, or maybe I'm not understanding well the meaning of ""group manager"". It is indeed faster. > Differences could come from a difference of numerical settings in the solver which are used when gathering nodes together (iteration max, tolerance, threshold ..). It is possible. However, the second cube is copy/paste of the first one. They both have an ODE solver with the same properties. I would expect that they are combined into a solver with exactly the same properties.

My guest would be that solving one big system (the merge of both objects) is slower than solving to smaller system. However, solving two system independently should, I think, produce incorrect results as . 1. You are applying the interactions (for example, contact forces) at different solving states. For example, the first object is solved, its node positions are updated to the step t+1. Collisions are then computed. But the state of the second object is still at the time step t. Oscillation will therefore probably happen and the convergence will be delayed. ; 2. In addition, the solution state with both objects merged under the same system takes into account the interaction between the two objects. For example, when both objects are merged into a same system, you can create entries inside the system matrix to create a relationship between a node in the first object and a node in the second object. This is not possible when the two objects are separated. **TLDR**: Solving two objects independently is faster than solving one big system containing both objects. However it will take longer to converge to a steady solution (in number of steps), and even probably converge to an incorrect solution.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2089#issuecomment-842947771

But there is an issue regarding rayleigh damping. If we consider implicit damping forces, we would have something like f = - (a*M + b*K)*v_new. That M and K are constants (for example, they can be the M and K of the current point (M0 and K0 for instance)). They must remain constant, or we should take their derivatives. . That means that during the linear solve, we have to compute M and K of the current linealization point and M0 and K0 of the point where we compute the damping forces. That is not efficient at all.

If there is no other solution to perform this critical operation, I'd like to know how many messages should we send to justify that a code is needed and should not be ""savagely"" removed?. To answer your question @epernod, yes this function was indeed written for topological changes, but on the mechanical side (not geometrical). Indeed, independently of the method that you use for topological modifications, you will need to recompute your mechanical matrices. Since you don't know which forcefield is used in your scene you cannot put that directly in a plugin. I guess that without this function you have to call reinit of your forcefield (assuming that the function is correctly implemented). However, there are many cases where these topological modifications only change some elements and not the entire mesh (there are many papers that describe this point on the web if you are interested...). In this case, the reinit method will be very expensive for nothing! I'm sure you are aware that sofa is designed for real-time, so we have to provide a solution to only compute the elements that are modified. . In conclusion, if you combine the fact that you don't know the underlying forcefield and you want to recompute only subpart of Ke elements, you may think that it would be a great idea to have a method in BaseForcefield where you can specify which Ke you want to compute. This is precisely the goal of this function !. The question now is what is the alternative solution?

I'm not sure I understand it correctly, but it seems to me that this is not actually 'the good way', just something made possible by the fact that the volume can be directly multiplied to the Strain Displacement matrix, without creating artificial torque. So you can make the assumption that the volume of the element doesn't change much, and that using its initial volume during the whole deformation is a good approximation, which saves computational time.; It would be better if someone could comment on this, because I really don't know if I'm right. That being said, when looking in the code of `TriangleFEMForceField`, the area of the triangles seems to be recomputed anyway in `computeStrainDisplacement`, with:; ```; Real determinant = b[0] * c[1]; // Surface * 2; ```; which is used to update the Strain Displacement matrix at each time step. By comparison, the difference with `computeStrainDisplacement` in `TriangularFEMForceField` is juste the next line; ```; determinant = b[0] * c[1];; triangleInf[elementIndex].area = determinant*0.5f;; ```; Following the paper, I think the computation of `determinant` at each time step should also be replaced by the triangle initial area. Or alternatively, follow the same version as in `TriangularFEMForceField` and update the triangle's area to make use of the computation.

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2348#issuecomment-930006073:1143,Performance,Perform,Performances-wise,1143,"Indeed, the point of ""slaves"" objects was that they are NOT visible on the graph, so not returned by getObjects or touched by visitors including events. It is up to their ""master"" object to decide what to do with them. As far as I know, the 2 cases where that is used a lot are:; - bounding volume hierarchies in collision models, where the ""real"" model is the master and a hierarchy of CubeModel is added as slaves; - engines (such as topological engines) that are created by an object to modify its own data. If events are propagated automatically to all slaves, then it kind of defeat the purpose. If that is needed, why not putting these objects as normal ones within the graph ? or maybe add a flag in BaseObject to enable calling propagateEvent to all slave objects in the default propagateEvent implementation. Semantically, slaves are ""owned"" by their master. All objects must have only one parent node, and optionally one master object (in which case they are only indirectly contained in the node). It should not be possible for a single object to appear multiple times on the graph (otherwise what would its getContext() return ?). Performances-wise, temporary copies of potentially large set of smart pointers is indeed worrisome (and would be a no-go for me)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2348#issuecomment-930006073

Can you elaborate a bit about moving Vector3 to Vec<3, SReal> instead of Vec3. . On my side I was using the parametrized version (Vec<A, B>) only when the templates parameters are really variables (eg: in something like Vec3<DataType::NDim, DataType::Real>). When the type I want is actually fully definied I was more on using Vec3, Vec3f, Vec3d (to be obvious and explicit that the type is fixed). . I also searched in our code base to see what was the most common option and found:; - 1192 matches for ""Vec<3""; - 4907 matches for ""Vec3""",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2560#issuecomment-1001667363

Can this be reopened for discussion ? ; My pros for reverting this or keeping the python naming instead of xml:. - It breaks *absolutely all my scenes*... ^^ and I guess I'm not the only one. ; - The warning saying ""you have two components with the same name"" can often help you catch a problem/error/bug in your scene. It happened to me, like a lot. ; - Having all those zeros impedes the readability.

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2661#issuecomment-1046728613:2258,Modifiability,plugin,plugins,2258,"e difference between `MatrixLinearSolver<...,...,NoThreadManager>` and `MatrixLinearSolver<...,...,AsyncThreadManager>` is only in the class implementation. This template mechanism means that it is possible to explicitly instantiate any linear solver as an asynchronous solver. In that case, it will use `MatrixLinearSolver<AsyncThreadManager>` as its base class. On the contrary, `AsyncSparseLDLSolver` introduced in this PR is not generic. It derives from `SparseLDLSolver`. It is specific to `SparseLDLSolver`.; - Because of the previous point, in SofaAsyncSolvers, asynchronous solver components are differentiated only by the template name prefix `Async`. For example, in XML, it is declared as `<SparseLDLSolver template=""AsyncCompressedRowSparseMatrixMat3x3d""/>`, compared to the synchronous solver `<SparseLDLSolver template=""CompressedRowSparseMatrixMat3x3d""/>`. In this PR, `AsyncSparseLDLSolver` is a different component than `SparseLDLSolver` and must use the usual templates: `<AsyncSparseLDLSolver template=""CompressedRowSparseMatrixMat3x3d""/>`.; - `AsyncSparseLDLSolver` uses `std::async`, while `MatrixLinearSolver<AsyncThreadManager>` uses `boost::thread`, hence a dependency to boost. `std::async` may use a thread pool.

I am not sure it is the case in SofaAsyncSolvers.; - In SofaAsyncSolvers, there are some references to an asynchronous matrix assembly. I don't know for sure that it is really used. Code refers to `ThreadSafeForceField`, and I don't know where those forces fields are. `AsyncSparseLDLSolver` assembles the matrix synchronously. In SofaAsyncSolvers, only `SparseLDLSolver` and `SSORPreconditioner` are specialized to be asynchronous. But I guess there must be other private plugins specializing solvers. For now, I only wanted a basic asynchronous LDL solver. Therefore I did not feel that it was necessary to have a generic base class for any asynchronous solver.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2661#issuecomment-1046728613

Is `iterationCounter` reset when you press the reset button?; > ; It is reset to 0 in method: void RealGUI::resetScene(). > 2. What's the difference between `iterationCounter` and `frameCounter`?. the only diff I see is that frameCounter is reset to 0 when you pause/play the scene. I assume it is just used as counter for the FPS calculation. You could remove this reset to 0 and use it instead of the new iterationCounter.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2742#issuecomment-1081495442

First, I have some precisions regarding Fred's remark: with the modification I suggested, I see a critical performance drop in the caduceus scene, going from ~150-200 FPS before the change, to ~25 FPS after. I expect that, indeed, the barycentric mapping accesses the `m_positions` field of the `OGLmodel`, consequently causing extensive triggering of the callback at each time step. So the solution I first suggested should be discarded anyway. @hugtalbot, using the `m_restPositions` field for the callback doesn't have the same performance issue. However I believe that this field is not used in the rendering process of the `OglModel`. Or, at least, calling `initVisual()` after a change of `m_restPositions` doesn't change the visual. So this solution doesn't solve the initial issue I had. I tried to look into how the `BarycentricMapping` works in details, but I'm afraid it is a bit too complexe for me with the time I have at the moment... My idea was to find how the barycentric mapping makes sure that the visual OGLModel is updated at each time step, and mimick this. If someone is familiar with the process ?. In the meantime, regarding the specific scenario I was working on, I'm using another workaround. Instead of dynamically changing the source file of the loader, I'm creating as many loaders as mesh files I have, and I dynamically change the loader I need at a given time during the simulation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2925#issuecomment-1137038775

So the solution I first suggested should be discarded anyway. @hugtalbot, using the `m_restPositions` field for the callback doesn't have the same performance issue. However I believe that this field is not used in the rendering process of the `OglModel`. Or, at least, calling `initVisual()` after a change of `m_restPositions` doesn't change the visual. So this solution doesn't solve the initial issue I had. I tried to look into how the `BarycentricMapping` works in details, but I'm afraid it is a bit too complexe for me with the time I have at the moment...

In the master branch, the code actually compute another matrix which is not the one we need. Hence the simulation fail at the first step. For this branch the smilation failed when the message ""D(k,k) is zero"" appear. I don't know if there is an issue with this scene or with the solver. 2) In the code, we exploit the LDL factorization in order to solve only one triangular system (and not two). We are allowed to do that by rewriting the matricial product we need to compute. It will then write as A *D^-1 * A^t. We need to apply D^-1 and it won't commute, that is why there is two matrices in memory (we could store only one with the Cholesky factorization).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3010#issuecomment-1148348342
