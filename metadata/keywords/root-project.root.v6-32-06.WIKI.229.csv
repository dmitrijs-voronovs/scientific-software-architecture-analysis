ROOT; » MONTECARLO; » PYTHIA8; » TPythia8. class TPythia8: public TGenerator. TPythia8. TPythia is an interface class to C++ version of Pythia 8.1; event generators, written by T.Sjostrand. The user is assumed to be familiar with the Pythia package.; This class includes only a basic interface to Pythia8. Because Pythia8 is; also written in C++, its functions/classes can be called directly from a; compiled C++ script.; To call Pythia functions not available in this interface a dictionary must; be generated.; see $ROOTSYS/tutorials/pythia/pythia8.C for an example of use from CINT. | |; | *------------------------------------------------------------------------------* |; | | | |; | | | |; | | PPP Y Y TTTTT H H III A Welcome to the Lund Monte Carlo! | |; | | P P Y Y T H H I A A This is PYTHIA version 8.100 | |; | | PPP Y T HHHHH I AAAAA Last date of change: 20 Oct 2007 | |; | | P Y T H H I A A | |; | | P Y T H H III A A Now is 27 Oct 2007 at 18:26:53 | |; | | | |; | | Main author: Torbjorn Sjostrand; CERN/PH, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland, | |; | | and Department of Theoretical Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; | |; | | phone: + 41 - 22 - 767 82 27; e-mail: torbjorn@thep.lu.se | |; | | Author: Stephen Mrenna; Computing Division, Simulations Group, | |; | | Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, MS 234, Batavia, IL 60510, USA; | |; | | phone: + 1 - 630 - 840 - 2556; e-mail: mrenna@fnal.gov | |; | | Author: Peter Skands; CERN/PH, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland, | |; | | and Theoretical Physics Department, | |; | | Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, MS 106, Batavia, IL 60510, USA; | |; | | phone: + 41 - 22 - 767 24 59; e-mail: skands@fnal.gov | |; | | | |; | | The main program reference is the 'Brief Introduction to PYTHIA 8.1', | |; | | T.

This is the ROOT implementation of the Qt object communication; mechanism (see also http://www.troll.no/qt/metaobjects.html). Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.; When an object has changed in some way that might be interesting; for the outside world, it emits a signal to tell whoever is; listening. All slots that are connected to this signal will be; activated (called). It is even possible to connect a signal; directly to another signal (this will emit the second signal; immediately whenever the first is emitted.) There is no limitation; on the number of slots that can be connected to a signal.; The slots will be activated in the order they were connected; to the signal. This mechanism allows objects to be easily reused,; because the object that emits a signal does not need to know; to which objects the signals are connected.; Together, signals and slots make up a powerfull component; programming mechanism.

Source:; header file; source file; viewVC header viewVC source. Sections:; class description; function members; data members; class charts. ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TQCommand. class TQCommand: public TList, public TQObject. The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack. Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)""; ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 1st parameter - the name of class; 2nd parameter - object; 3rd parameter - the name of do/redo method; 4th parameter - the name of undo method. Since redo,undo methods are the same, undo name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. For objects derived from TObject class name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 2. Setting undo, redo parameters. Color_t old_color = hpx->GetFillColor();; Color_t new_color = 4; // blue color. com->SetRedoArgs(1, new_color);; com->SetUndoArgs(1, old_color);. 1st argument - the number of undo, redo parameters; the other arguments - undo, redo values. Since the number of undo,redo parameters is the same one can use. com->SetArgs(1, new_color, old_color);. 3.
