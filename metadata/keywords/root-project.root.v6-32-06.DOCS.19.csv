If clang successfully produces an executable, but that executable doesn't run; right, this is either a bug in the code or a bug in the compiler. The first; thing to check is to make sure it is not using undefined behavior (e.g.; reading a variable before it is defined). In particular, check to see if the; program is clean under various `sanitizers; <https://github.com/google/sanitizers>`_ (e.g. ``clang; -fsanitize=undefined,address``) and `valgrind <http://valgrind.org/>`_. Many; ""LLVM bugs"" that we have chased down ended up being bugs in the program being; compiled, not LLVM. Once you determine that the program itself is not buggy, you should choose; which code generator you wish to compile the program with (e.g. LLC or the JIT); and optionally a series of LLVM passes to run. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you. It will print a message letting you know how to reproduce the; resulting error. The :doc:`OptBisect <OptBisect>` page shows an alternative method for finding; incorrect optimization passes. Incorrect code generation; =========================. Similarly to debugging incorrect compilation by mis-behaving passes, you; can debug incorrect code generation by either LLC or the JIT, using; ``bugpoint``. The process ``bugpoint`` follows in this case is to try to; narrow the code down to a function that is miscompiled by one or the other; method, but since for correctness, the entire program must be run,; ``bugpoint`` will compile the code it deems to not be affected with the C; Backend, and then link in the shared object it generates.

This rule is also meant to assist SamplePGO by banning; scenarios in which a sample of a block containing a merged instruction is; misattributed to a block containing one of the instructions-to-be-merged. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Merging identical loads/stores which occur on both sides of a CFG diamond; (see the ``MergedLoadStoreMotion`` pass). * Merging identical loop-invariant stores (see the LICM utility; ``llvm::promoteLoopAccessesToScalars``). * Peephole optimizations which combine multiple instructions together, like; ``(add (mul A B) C) => llvm.fma.f32(A, B, C)``. Note that the location of; the ``fma`` does not exactly correspond to the locations of either the; ``mul`` or the ``add`` instructions. Examples of transformations for which this rule *does not* apply include:. * Block-local peepholes which delete redundant instructions, like; ``(sext (zext i8 %x to i16) to i32) => (zext i8 %x to i32)``. The inner; ``zext`` is modified but remains in its block, so the rule for; :ref:`preserving locations<WhenToPreserveLocation>` should apply. * Converting an if-then-else CFG diamond into a ``select``. Preserving the; debug locations of speculated instructions can make it seem like a condition; is true when it's not (or vice versa), which leads to a confusing; single-stepping experience.

The purpose of this rule is to prevent erratic or misleading single-stepping; behavior in situations in which an instruction has no clear, unambiguous; relationship to a source location. To handle an instruction without a location, the DWARF generator; defaults to allowing the last-set location after a label to cascade forward, or; to setting a line 0 location with viable scope information if no previous; location is available.

Introduction; ============. Certain kinds of code transformations can inadvertently result in a loss of; debug info, or worse, make debug info misrepresent the state of a program. This document specifies how to correctly update debug info in various kinds of; code transformations, and offers suggestions for how to create targeted debug; info tests for arbitrary transformations. For more on the philosophy behind LLVM debugging information, see; :doc:`SourceLevelDebugging`. Rules for updating debug locations; ==================================. .. _WhenToPreserveLocation:. When to preserve an instruction location; ----------------------------------------. A transformation should preserve the debug location of an instruction if the; instruction either remains in its basic block, or if its basic block is folded; into a predecessor that branches unconditionally. The APIs to use are; ``IRBuilder``, or ``Instruction::setDebugLoc``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that common block-local optimizations; preserve the ability to set breakpoints on source locations corresponding to; the instructions they touch. Debugging, crash logs, and SamplePGO accuracy; would be severely impacted if that ability were lost. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Instruction scheduling. Block-local instruction reordering should not drop; source locations, even though this may lead to jumpy single-stepping; behavior. * Simple jump threading. For example, if block ``B1`` unconditionally jumps to; ``B2``, *and* is its unique predecessor, instructions from ``B2`` can be; hoisted into ``B1``. Source locations from ``B2`` should be preserved. * Peephole optimizations that replace or expand an instruction, like ``(add X; X) => (shl X 1)``. The location of the ``shl`` instru",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst

See the discussion in the section about; :ref:`merging locations<WhenToMergeLocation>` for examples of when the rule for; dropping locations applies. Rules for updating debug values; ===============================. Deleting an IR-level Instruction; --------------------------------. When an ``Instruction`` is deleted, its debug uses change to ``undef``. This is; a loss of debug info: the value of one or more source variables becomes; unavailable, starting with the ``llvm.dbg.value(undef, ...)``. When there is no; way to reconstitute the value of the lost instruction, this is the best; possible outcome. However, it's often possible to do better:. * If the dying instruction can be RAUW'd, do so. The; ``Value::replaceAllUsesWith`` API transparently updates debug uses of the; dying instruction to point to the replacement value. * If the dying instruction cannot be RAUW'd, call ``llvm::salvageDebugInfo`` on; it. This makes a best-effort attempt to rewrite debug uses of the dying; instruction by describing its effect as a ``DIExpression``. * If one of the **operands** of a dying instruction would become trivially; dead, use ``llvm::replaceAllDbgUsesWith`` to rewrite the debug uses of that; operand. Consider the following example function:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i16 @foo(i16 %a) {; %b = sext i16 %a to i32; %c = and i32 %b, 15; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %c, ...); %d = trunc i32 %c to i16; ret i16 %d; }.

It can be useful to combine ``mir-debugify``, ``mir-check-debugify`` and/or; ``mir-strip-debug`` to identify backend transformations which break in; the presence of debug info.

When to preserve an instruction location; ----------------------------------------. A transformation should preserve the debug location of an instruction if the; instruction either remains in its basic block, or if its basic block is folded; into a predecessor that branches unconditionally. The APIs to use are; ``IRBuilder``, or ``Instruction::setDebugLoc``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that common block-local optimizations; preserve the ability to set breakpoints on source locations corresponding to; the instructions they touch. Debugging, crash logs, and SamplePGO accuracy; would be severely impacted if that ability were lost. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Instruction scheduling. Block-local instruction reordering should not drop; source locations, even though this may lead to jumpy single-stepping; behavior. * Simple jump threading. For example, if block ``B1`` unconditionally jumps to; ``B2``, *and* is its unique predecessor, instructions from ``B2`` can be; hoisted into ``B1``. Source locations from ``B2`` should be preserved. * Peephole optimizations that replace or expand an instruction, like ``(add X; X) => (shl X 1)``. The location of the ``shl`` instruction should be the same; as the location of the ``add`` instruction. * Tail duplication. For example, if blocks ``B1`` and ``B2`` both; unconditionally branch to ``B3`` and ``B3`` can be folded into its; predecessors, source locations from ``B3`` should be preserved. Examples of transformations for which this rule *does not* apply include:. * LICM. E.g., if an instruction is moved from the loop body to the preheader,; the rule for :ref:`dropping locations<WhenToDropLocation>` applies.

Using ``debugify``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A simple way to use ``debugify`` is as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. $ opt -debugify -pass-to-test -check-debugify sample.ll. This will inject synthetic DI to ``sample.ll`` run the ``pass-to-test`` and; then check for missing DI. The ``-check-debugify`` step can of course be; omitted in favor of more customizable FileCheck directives. Some other ways to run debugify are available:. .. code-block:: bash. # Same as the above example.; $ opt -enable-debugify -pass-to-test sample.ll. # Suppresses verbose debugify output.; $ opt -enable-debugify -debugify-quiet -pass-to-test sample.ll. # Prepend -debugify before and append -check-debugify -strip after; # each pass on the pipeline (similar to -verify-each).; $ opt -debugify-each -O2 sample.ll. In order for ``check-debugify`` to work, the DI must be coming from; ``debugify``. Thus, modules with existing DI will be skipped. ``debugify`` can be used to test a backend, e.g:. .. code-block:: bash. $ opt -debugify < sample.ll | llc -o -.

The API to; use is ``Instruction::dropLocation()``. The purpose of this rule is to prevent erratic or misleading single-stepping; behavior in situations in which an instruction has no clear, unambiguous; relationship to a source location. To handle an instruction without a location, the DWARF generator; defaults to allowing the last-set location after a label to cascade forward, or; to setting a line 0 location with viable scope information if no previous; location is available. See the discussion in the section about; :ref:`merging locations<WhenToMergeLocation>` for examples of when the rule for; dropping locations applies. Rules for updating debug values; ===============================. Deleting an IR-level Instruction; --------------------------------. When an ``Instruction`` is deleted, its debug uses change to ``undef``. This is; a loss of debug info: the value of one or more source variables becomes; unavailable, starting with the ``llvm.dbg.value(undef, ...)``. When there is no; way to reconstitute the value of the lost instruction, this is the best; possible outcome.

Consider the following example function:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i16 @foo(i16 %a) {; %b = sext i16 %a to i32; %c = and i32 %b, 15; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %c, ...); %d = trunc i32 %c ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToUpdateDebugInfo.rst

Insertion of; ``DBG_VALUE``'s can be disabled by setting ``-debugify-level=locations``. To run MIRDebugify once, simply insert ``mir-debugify`` into your ``llc``; invocation, like:. .. code-block:: bash. # Before some other pass.; $ llc -run-pass=mir-debugify,other-pass ... # After some other pass.; $ llc -run-pass=other-pass,mir-debugify ... To run MIRDebugify before each pass in a pipeline, use; ``-debugify-and-strip-all-safe``. This can be combined with ``-start-before``; and ``-start-after``. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -debugify-and-strip-all-safe -run-pass=... <other llc args>; $ llc -debugify-and-strip-all-safe -O1 <other llc args>. If you want to check it after each pass in a pipeline, use; ``-debugify-check-and-strip-all-safe``. This can also be combined with; ``-start-before`` and ``-start-after``. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -debugify-check-and-strip-all-safe -run-pass=... <other llc args>; $ llc -debugify-check-and-strip-all-safe -O1 <other llc args>. To check all debug info from a test, use ``mir-check-debugify``, like:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -run-pass=mir-debugify,other-pass,mir-check-debugify. To strip out all debug info from a test, use ``mir-strip-debug``, like:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -run-pass=mir-debugify,other-pass,mir-strip-debug. It can be useful to combine ``mir-debugify``, ``mir-check-debugify`` and/or; ``mir-strip-debug`` to identify backend transformations which break in; the presence of debug info. For example, to run the AArch64 backend tests; with all normal passes ""sandwiched"" in between MIRDebugify and; MIRStripDebugify mutation passes, run:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-lit test/CodeGen/AArch64 -Dllc=""llc -debugify-and-strip-all-safe"".

Using ``debugify``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A simple way to use ``debugify`` is as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. $ opt -debugify -pass-to-test -check-debugify sample.ll. This will inject synthetic DI to ``sample.ll`` run the ``pass-to-test`` and; then check for missing DI. The ``-check-debugify`` step can of course be; omitted in favor of more customizable FileCheck directives. Some other ways to run debugify are available:. .. code-block:: bash. # Same as the above example.; $ opt -enable-debugify -pass-to-test sample.ll. # Suppresses verbose debugify output.; $ opt -enable-debugify -debugify-quiet -pass-to-test sample.ll. # Prepend -debugify before and append -check-debugify -strip after; # each pass on the pipeline (similar to -verify-each).; $ opt -debugify-each -O2 sample.ll. In order for ``check-debugify`` to work, the DI must be coming from; ``debugify``. Thus, modules with existing DI will be skipped. ``debugify`` can be used to test a backend, e.g:. .. code-block:: bash. $ opt -debugify < sample.ll | llc -o -.

For the raw format,; the magic number also encodes the endianness (big or little) and C pointer; size (4 or 8 bytes) of the platform on which the profile is generated. A factory method reads the magic number to construct reader properly and returns; error upon unrecognized format. Specifically, the factory method and raw profile; reader implementation make sure that a raw profile file could be read back on; a platform with the opposite endianness and/or the other C pointer size. ``Version``; The lower 32 bits specify the actual version and the most significant 32 bits; specify the variant types of the profile. IR-based instrumentation PGO and; context-sensitive IR-based instrumentation PGO are two variant types. ``BinaryIdsSize``; The byte size of `binary id`_ section. ``NumData``; The number of profile metadata.

Raw Profile Format; ===================. The raw profile is generated by running the instrumented binary. The raw profile; data from an executable or a shared library [3]_ consists of a header and; multiple sections, with each section as a memory dump. The raw profile data needs; to be reasonably compact and fast to generate. There are no backward or forward version compatiblity guarantees for the raw profile; format. That is, compilers and tools `require`_ a specific raw profile version; to parse the profiles. .. _`require`: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/bffdde8b8e5d9a76a47949cd0f574f3ce656e181/llvm/lib/ProfileData/InstrProfReader.cpp#L551-L558. To feed profiles back into compilers for an optimized build (e.g., via; ``-fprofile-use`` for IR instrumentation), a raw profile must to be converted into; indexed format. General Storage Layout; -----------------------. The storage layout of raw profile data format is illustrated below.

Passes; ------. JITLink passes are ``std::function<Error(LinkGraph&)>`` instances. They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features. For example:. * Relaxation optimizations -- A pre-fixup pass can inspect GOT accesses and PLT; calls and identify situations where the addresses of the entry target and the; access are close enough to be accessed directly. In this case the pass can; rewrite the instruction stream of the containing block and update the fixup; edges to make the access direct. Code for this looks like:. .. code-block:: c++.

Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail. Link graph construction utilities (especially parsers; for object formats) are encouraged to validate input, and validate fixups; (e.g. with range checks) before application. Any error will halt the link process and notify the context of failure. In ORC,; reported failures are propagated to queries pending on definitions provided by; the failing link, and also through edges of the dependence graph to any queries; waiting on dependent symbols. .. _connection_to_orc_runtime:. Connection to the ORC Runtime; =============================. The ORC Runtime (currently under development) aims to provide runtime support; for advanced JIT features, including object format features that require; non-trivial action in the executor (e.g. running initializers, managing thread; local storage, registering with language runtimes, etc.). ORC Runtime support for object format features typically requires cooperation; between the runtime (which executes in the executor process) and JITLink (which; runs in the JIT process and can inspect LinkGraphs to determine what actions; must be taken in the executor).

Rather than dumping relocatable objects to disk as a compiler; usually would, MCJIT passed them to RuntimeDyld to be linked into a target; process. This approach to linking differs from standard *static* or *dynamic* linking:. A *static linker* takes one or more relocatable object files as input and links; them into an executable or dynamic library on disk. A *dynamic linker* applies relocations to executables and dynamic libraries that; have been loaded into memory. A *JIT linker* takes a single relocatable object file at a time and links it; into a target process, usually using a context object to allow the linked code; to resolve symbols in the target. RuntimeDyld; -----------. In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of relocations that had to be supported. #. It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage. As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations.

If you know; what a section, symbol, and relocation are you should find this document; accessible. If it is not, please submit a patch (:doc:`Contributing`) or file a; bug (:doc:`HowToSubmitABug`). JITLink is a library for :ref:`jit_linking`. It was built to support the :doc:`ORC JIT; APIs<ORCv2>` and is most commonly accessed via ORC's ObjectLinkingLayer API. JITLink was; developed with the aim of supporting the full set of features provided by each; object format; including static initializers, exception handling, thread local; variables, and language runtime registration. Supporting these features enables; ORC to execute code generated from source languages which rely on these features; (e.g. C++ requires object format support for static initializers to support; static constructors, eh-frame registration for exceptions, and TLV support for; thread locals; Swift and Objective-C require language runtime registration for; many features). For some object format features support is provided entirely; within JITLink, and for others it is provided in cooperation with the; (prototype) ORC runtime. JITLink aims to support the following features, some of which are still under; development:. 1. Cross-process and cross-architecture linking of single relocatable objects; into a target *executor* process. 2. Support for all object format features. 3.

It is an ORC layer that; allows objects to be added to a ``JITDylib``, or emitted from some higher level; program representation. When an object is emitted, ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` uses; JITLink to construct a ``LinkGraph`` (see :ref:`constructing_linkgraphs`) and; calls JITLink's ``link`` function to link the graph into the executor process. The ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` class provides a plugin API,; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``, which users can subclass in order to inspect and; modify ``LinkGraph`` instances at link time, and react to important JIT events; (such as an object being emitted into target memory). This enables many features; and optimizations that were not possible under MCJIT or RuntimeDyld. ObjectLinkingLayer Plugins; --------------------------.

Relocatable object formats (e.g. COFF, ELF, MachO) differ in their details,; but share a common goal: to represent machine level code and data with; annotations that allow them to be relocated in a virtual address space. To; this end they usually contain names (symbols) for content defined inside the; file or externally, chunks of content that must be moved as a unit (sections; or subsections, depending on the format), and annotations describing how to; patch content based on the final address of some target symbol/section; (relocations). At a high level, the ``LinkGraph`` type represents these concepts as a decorated; graph. Nodes in the graph represent symbols and content, and edges represent; relocations. Each of the elements of the graph is listed here:. * ``Addressable`` -- A node in the link graph that can be assigned an address; in the executor process's virtual address space.

The ``allocate`` method takes a ``JITLinkDylib*`` representing the target; simulated dylib, a reference to the ``LinkGraph`` that must be allocated for,; and a callback to run once an ``InFlightAlloc`` has been constructed.; ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` implementations can (optionally) use the ``JD``; argument to manage a per-simulated-dylib memory pool (since code model; constraints are typically imposed on a per-dylib basis, and not across; dylibs) [2]_.

JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping). Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail.

Connection to the ORC Runtime; =============================. The ORC Runtime (currently under development) aims to provide runtime support; for advanced JIT features, including object format features that require; non-trivial action in the executor (e.g. running initializers, managing thread; local storage, registering with language runtimes, etc.). ORC Runtime support for object format features typically requires cooperation; between the runtime (which executes in the executor process) and JITLink (which; runs in the JIT process and can inspect LinkGraphs to determine what actions; must be taken in the executor). For example: Execution of MachO static; initializers in the ORC runtime is performed by the ``jit_dlopen`` function,; which calls back to the JIT process to ask for the list of address ranges of; ``__mod_init`` sections to walk. This list is collated by the; ``MachOPlatformPlugin``, which installs a pass to record this information for; each object as it is linked into the target. .. _constructing_linkgraphs:.

The JIT linker concept was introduced in LLVM's earlier generation of JIT APIs,; MCJIT. In MCJIT the *RuntimeDyld* component enabled re-use of LLVM as an; in-memory compiler by adding an in-memory link step to the end of the usual; compiler pipeline. Rather than dumping relocatable objects to disk as a compiler; usually would, MCJIT passed them to RuntimeDyld to be linked into a target; process. This approach to linking differs from standard *static* or *dynamic* linking:. A *static linker* takes one or more relocatable object files as input and links; them into an executable or dynamic library on disk. A *dynamic linker* applies relocations to executables and dynamic libraries that; have been loaded into memory. A *JIT linker* takes a single relocatable object file at a time and links it; into a target process, usually using a context object to allow the linked code; to resolve symbols in the target. RuntimeDyld; -----------. In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of rel",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

The ``-oop-executor[=/path/to/executor]`` option tells ``llvm-jitlink`` to; execute the given executor (which defaults to ``llvm-jitlink-executor``) and; communicate with it via file descriptors which it passes to the executor; as the first argument with the format ``filedescs=<in-fd>,<out-fd>``. The ``-oop-executor-connect=<host>:<port>`` option tells ``llvm-jitlink`` to; connect to an already running executor via TCP on the given host and port. To; use this option you will need to start ``llvm-jitlink-executor`` manually with; ``listen=<host>:<port>`` as the first argument. Harness mode; ------------. The ``-harness`` option allows a set of input objects to be designated as a test; harness, with the regular object files implicitly treated as objects to be; tested. Definitions of symbols in the harness set override definitions in the; test set, and external references from the harness cause automatic scope; promotion of local symbols in the test set (these modifications to the usual; linker rules are accomplished via an ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin`` installed by; ``llvm-jitlink`` when it sees the ``-harness`` option). With these modifications in place we can selectively test functions in an object; file by mocking those function's callees. For example, suppose we have an object; file, ``test_code.o``, compiled from the following C source (which we need not; have access to):. .. code-block:: c. void irrelevant_function() { irrelevant_external(); }. int function_to_mock(int X) {; return /* some function of X */;; }. static void function_to_test() {; ...; int Y = function_to_mock();; printf(""Y is %i\n"", Y);; }. If we want to know how ``function_to_test`` behaves when we change the behavior; of ``function_to_mock`` we can test it by writing a test harness:. .. code-block:: c. void function_to_test();. int function_to_mock(int X) {; printf(""used mock utility function\n"");; return 42;; }. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; fun",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

Passes; ------. JITLink passes are ``std::function<Error(LinkGraph&)>`` instances. They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features. For example:. * Relaxation optimizations -- A pre-fixup pass can inspect GOT accesses and PLT; calls and identify situations where the addresses of the entry target and the; access are close enough to be accessed directly. In this case the pass can; rewrite the instruction stream of the containing block and update the fixup; edges to make the access direct. Code for this looks like:. .. code-block:: c++.

Memory Management with JITLinkMemoryManager; -------------------------------------------. JIT linking requires allocation of two kinds of memory: working memory in the; JIT process and target memory in the execution process (these processes and; memory allocations may be one and the same, depending on how the user wants; to build their JIT). It also requires that these allocations conform to the; requested code model in the target process (e.g. MachO/x86-64's Small code; model requires that all code and data for a simulated dylib is allocated within; 4Gb). Finally, it is natural to make the memory manager responsible for; transferring memory to the target address space and applying memory protections,; since the memory manager must know how to communicate with the executor, and; since sharing and protection assignment can often be efficiently managed (in; the common case of running across processes on the same machine for security); via the host operating system's virtual memory management APIs. To satisfy these requirements ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` adopts the following; design: The memory manager itself has just two virtual methods for asynchronous; operations (each with convenience overloads for calling synchronously):. .. code-block:: c++. /// Called when allocation has been completed.; using OnAllocatedFunction =; unique_function<void(Expected<std::unique_ptr<InFlightAlloc>)>;. /// Called when deallocation has completed.; using OnDeallocatedFunction = unique_function<void(Erro",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

It is an ORC layer that; allows objects to be added to a ``JITDylib``, or emitted from some higher level; program representation. When an object is emitted, ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` uses; JITLink to construct a ``LinkGraph`` (see :ref:`constructing_linkgraphs`) and; calls JITLink's ``link`` function to link the graph into the executor process. The ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` class provides a plugin API,; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``, which users can subclass in order to inspect and; modify ``LinkGraph`` instances at link time, and react to important JIT events; (such as an object being emitted into target memory). This enables many features; and optimizations that were not possible under MCJIT or RuntimeDyld. ObjectLinkingLayer Plugins; --------------------------. The ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin`` class provides the following methods:. * ``modifyPassConfig`` is called each time a LinkGraph is about to be linked.

LinkGraph; =========. JITLink maps all relocatable object formats to a generic ``LinkGraph`` type; that is designed to make linking fast and easy (``LinkGraph`` instances can; also be created manually. See :ref:`constructing_linkgraphs`). Relocatable object formats (e.g. COFF, ELF, MachO) differ in their details,; but share a common goal: to represent machine level code and data with; annotations that allow them to be relocated in a virtual address space. To; this end they usually contain names (symbols) for content defined inside the; file or externally, chunks of content that must be moved as a unit (sections; or subsections, depending on the format), and annotations describing how to; patch content based on the final address of some target symbol/section; (relocations). At a high level, the ``LinkGraph`` type represents these concepts as a decorated; graph. Nodes in the graph represent symbols and content, and edges represent; relocations. Each of the elements of the graph is listed here:. * ``Addressable`` -- A node in the link graph that can be assigned an address; in the executor process's virtual address space. Absolute and external symbols are represented using plain ``Addressable``; instances. Content defined inside the object file is represented using the; ``Block`` subclass. * ``Block`` -- An ``Addressable`` node that has ``Content`` (or is marked as; zero-filled), a parent ``Section``, a ``Size``, an ``Alignment`` (and an; ``AlignmentOffset``), and a list of ``Edge`` instances. Blocks provide a container for binary content which must remain contiguous in; the target address space (a",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features.

Memory Management with JITLinkMemoryManager; -------------------------------------------. JIT linking requires allocation of two kinds of memory: working memory in the; JIT process and target memory in the execution process (these processes and; memory allocations may be one and the same, depending on how the user wants; to build their JIT). It also requires that these allocations conform to the; requested code model in the target process (e.g. MachO/x86-64's Small code; model requires that all code and data for a simulated dylib is allocated within; 4Gb). Finally, it is natural to make the memory manager responsible for; transferring memory to the target address space and applying memory protections,; since the memory manager must know how to communicate with the executor, and; since sharing and protection assignment can often be efficiently managed (in; the common case of running across processes on the same machine for security); via the host operating system's virtual memory management APIs. To satisfy these requirements ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` adopts the following; design: The memory manager itself has just two virtual methods for asynchronous; operations (each with convenience overloads for",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

A call to the; ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should cause content for the allocation to be; transferred from working to executor memory, and permissions to be run. A call; to ``abandon`` should result in both kinds of memory being deallocated. On successful finalization, the ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should; construct a ``FinalizedAlloc`` object (an opaque uint64_t id that the; ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` can use to identify executor memory for deallocation); and pass it to the ``OnFinalized`` callback.

JITLink is a library for :ref:`jit_linking`. It was built to support the :doc:`ORC JIT; APIs<ORCv2>` and is most commonly accessed via ORC's ObjectLinkingLayer API.

It is an ORC layer that; allows objects to be added to a ``JITDylib``, or emitted from some higher level; program representation. When an object is emitted, ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` uses; JITLink to construct a ``LinkGraph`` (see :ref:`constructing_linkgraphs`) and; calls JITLink's ``link`` function to link the graph into the executor process. The ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` class provides a plugin API,; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``, which users can subclass in order to inspect and; modify ``LinkGraph`` instances at link time, and react to important JIT events; (such as an object being emitted into target memory). This enables many features; and optimizations that were not possible under MCJIT or RuntimeDyld. ObjectLinkingLayer Plugins; --------------------------. The ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin`` class provides the following methods:. * ``modifyPassConfig`` is called each time a LinkGraph is about to be linked. It; can be overridden to install JITLink *Passes* to run during the link process. .. code-block:: c++. void modifyPassConfig(MaterializationResponsibility &MR,; const Triple &TT,; jitlink::PassConfiguration &Config). * ``notifyLoaded`` is called before the link begins, and can be overridden to; set up any initial state for the given ``MaterializationResponsibility`` if; needed. .. code-block:: c++. void notifyLoaded(MaterializationResponsibility &MR). * ``notifyEmitted`` is called after the link is complete and code has been; emitted to the executor pr",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

It is an ORC layer that; allows objects to be added to a ``JITDylib``, or emitted from some higher level; program representation.

If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features. For example:. * Relaxation optimizations -- A pre-fixup pass can inspect GOT accesses and PLT; calls and identify situations where the addresses of the entry target and the; access are close enough to be accessed directly. In this case the pass can; rewrite the instruction stream of the containing block and update the fixup; edges to make the access direct. Code for this looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. Error relaxGOTEdges(LinkGraph &G) {; for (auto *B : G.blocks()); for (auto &E : B->edges()); if (E.getKind() == x86_64::GOTLoad) {; auto &GOTTarget = getGOTEntryTarget(E.getTarget());; if (isInRange(B.getFixupAddress(E), GOTTarget)) {; // Rewrite B.getContent() at fixup address from; // MOVQ to LEAQ. // Update edge target and kind.; E.setTarget(GOTTarget);; E.setKind(x86_64::PCRel32);; }; }. return Error::success();; }. * Metadata registration -- Post allocation passes can be used to record the; address range of sections in the target. This can be used to register the; metadata (e.g exception handling frames, language metadata) in the target; once memory has been finalized. .. code-block:: c++.

This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping). Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual`",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

In ORC,; reported failures are propagated to queries pending on definitions provided by; the failing link, and also through edges of the dependence graph to any queries; waiting on dependent symbols. .. _connection_to_orc_runtime:. Connection to the ORC Runtime; =============================. The ORC Runtime (currently under development) aims to provide runtime support; for advanced JIT features, including object format features that require; non-trivial action in the executor (e.g. running initializers, managing thread; local storage, registering with language runtimes, etc.). ORC Runtime support for object format features typically requires cooperation; between the runtime (which executes in the executor process) and JITLink (which; runs in the JIT process and can inspect LinkGraphs to determine what actions; must be taken in the executor). For example: Execution of MachO static; initializers in the ORC runtime is performed by the ``jit_dlopen`` function,; which calls back to the JIT process to ask for the list of address ranges of; ``__mod_init`` sections to walk. This list is collated by the; ``MachOPlatformPlugin``, which installs a pass to record this information for; each object as it is linked into the target. .. _constructing_linkgraphs:. Constructing LinkGraphs; =======================. Clients usually access and manipulate ``LinkGraph`` instances that were created; for them by an ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` instance, but they can be created manually:. #. By directly constructing and populating a ``LinkGraph`` instance. #. By using the ``createLinkGraph`` family of functions to create a; ``LinkGraph`` from an in-memory buffer containing an object file. This is how; ``ObjectLinkingLayer`` usually creates ``LinkGraphs``. #. ``createLinkGraph_<Object-Format>_<Architecture>`` can be used when; both the object format and architecture are known ahead of time. #. ``createLinkGraph_<Object-Format>`` can be used when the object format is; ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

In this case the object header; will be inspected to determine both the format and architecture. .. _jit_linking:. JIT Linking; ===========. The JIT linker concept was introduced in LLVM's earlier generation of JIT APIs,; MCJIT. In MCJIT the *RuntimeDyld* component enabled re-use of LLVM as an; in-memory compiler by adding an in-memory link step to the end of the usual; compiler pipeline. Rather than dumping relocatable objects to disk as a compiler; usually would, MCJIT passed them to RuntimeDyld to be linked into a target; process. This approach to linking differs from standard *static* or *dynamic* linking:. A *static linker* takes one or more relocatable object files as input and links; them into an executable or dynamic library on disk. A *dynamic linker* applies relocations to executables and dynamic libraries that; have been loaded into memory. A *JIT linker* takes a single relocatable object file at a time and links it; into a target process, usually using a context object to allow the linked code; to resolve symbols in the target. RuntimeDyld; -----------. In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of relocations that had to be supported. #. It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage.

Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #.

Generic Link Algorithm; ======================. JITLink provides a generic link algorithm which can be extended / modified at; certain points by the introduction of JITLink :ref:`passes`. At the end of each phase the linker packages its state into a *continuation*; and calls the ``JITLinkContext`` object to perform a (potentially high-latency); asynchronous operation: allocating memory, resolving external symbols, and; finally transferring linked memory to the executing process. #. Phase 1. This phase is called immediately by the ``link`` function as soon as the; initial configuration (including the pass pipeline setup) is complete. #. Run pre-prune passes. These passes are called on the graph before it is pruned. At this stage; ``LinkGraph`` nodes still have their original vmaddrs. A mark-live pass; (supplied by the ``JITLinkContext``) will be run at the end of this; sequence to mark the initial set of live symbols. Notable use cases: marking nodes live, accessing/copying graph data that; will be pruned (e.g. metadata that's important for the JIT, but not needed; for the link process). #. Prune (dead-strip) the ``LinkGraph``. Removes all symbols and blocks not reachable from the initial set of live; symbols. This allows JITLink to remove unreachable symbols / content, including; overridden weak and redundant ODR definitions. #. Run post-prune passes. These passes are run on the graph after dead-stripping, but before memory; is allocated or nodes assigned their final target vmaddrs. Passes run at this stage benefit from pruning, as dead functions and data; have been stripped from the graph. However new content can still be added; to the graph, as target and working memory have not been allocated yet.

Memory Management with JITLinkMemoryManager; -------------------------------------------. JIT linking requires allocation of two kinds of memory: working memory in the; JIT process and target memory in the execution process (these processes and; memory allocations may be one and the same, depending on how the user wants; to build their JIT). It also requires that these allocations conform to the; requested code model in the target process (e.g. MachO/x86-64's Small code; model requires that all code and data for a simulated dylib is allocated within; 4Gb). Finally, it is natural to make the memory manager responsible for; transferring memory to the target address space and applying memory protections,; since the memory manager must know how to communicate with the executor, and; since sharing and protection assignment can often be efficiently managed (in; the common case of running across processes on the same machine for security); via the host operating system's virtual memory management APIs. To satisfy these requirements ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` adopts the following; design: The memory manager itself has just two virtual methods for asynchronous; operations (each with convenience overloads for calling synchronously):. .. code-block:: c++. /// Called when allocation has been completed.; using OnAllocatedFunction =; unique_function<void(Expected<std::unique_ptr<InFlightAlloc>)>;. /// Called when deallocation has completed.; using OnDeallocatedFunction = unique_function<void(Error)>;. /// Call to allocate memory.; virtual void allocate(const JITLinkDylib *JD, LinkGraph &G,; OnAllocatedFunction OnAllocated) = 0;. /// Call to deallocate memory.; virtual void deallocate(std::vector<FinalizedAlloc> Allocs,; OnDeallocatedFunction OnDeallocated) = 0;.

Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of relocations that had to be supported. #. It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage. As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations.

As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitlink``) and the tool itself.

A call to the; ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should cause content for the allocation to be; transferred from working to executor memory, and permissions to be run. A call; to ``abandon`` should result in both kinds of memory being deallocated. On successful finalization, the ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should; construct a ``FinalizedAlloc`` object (an opaque uint64_t id that the; ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` can use to identify executor memory for deallocation); and pass it to the ``OnFinalized`` callback. Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

The JIT linker concept was introduced in LLVM's earlier generation of JIT APIs,; MCJIT. In MCJIT the *RuntimeDyld* component enabled re-use of LLVM as an; in-memory compiler by adding an in-memory link step to the end of the usual; compiler pipeline. Rather than dumping relocatable objects to disk as a compiler; usually would, MCJIT passed them to RuntimeDyld to be linked into a target; process. This approach to linking differs from standard *static* or *dynamic* linking:. A *static linker* takes one or more relocatable object files as input and links; them into an executable or dynamic library on disk. A *dynamic linker* applies relocations to executables and dynamic libraries that; have been loaded into memory. A *JIT linker* takes a single relocatable object file at a time and links it; into a target process, usually using a context object to allow the linked code; to resolve symbols in the target. RuntimeDyld; -----------. In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of relocations that had to be supported. #. It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage. As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst

Eliminating these restrictions and limitations was one of the primary motivations; for the development of JITLink. The llvm-jitlink tool; =====================. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is a command line wrapper for the JITLink library.; It loads some set of relocatable object files and then links them using; JITLink. Depending on the options used it will then execute them, or validate; the linked memory. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool was originally designed to aid JITLink development by; providing a simple environment for testing. Basic usage; -----------. By default, ``llvm-jitlink`` will link the set of objects passed on the command; line, then search for a ""main"" function and execute it:. .. code-block:: sh. % cat hello-world.c; #include <stdio.h>. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; printf(""hello, world!\n"");; return 0;; }. % clang -c -o hello-world.o hello-world.c; % llvm-jitlink hello-world.o; Hello, World!.

Pointer values are associated with address ranges according; to the following rules:. - A pointer value is associated with the addresses associated with any; value it is *based* on.; - An address of a global variable is associated with the address range; of the variable's storage.; - The result value of an allocation instruction is associated with the; address range of the allocat",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst

DSO Local Equivalent; --------------------. ``dso_local_equivalent @func``. A '``dso_local_equivalent``' constant represents a function which is; functionally equivalent to a given function, but is always defined in the; current linkage unit. The resulting pointer has the same type as the underlying; function. The resulting pointer is permitted, but not required, to be different; from a pointer to the function, and it may have different values in different; translation units. The target function may not have ``extern_weak`` linkage. ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as such:. - If the function has local linkage, hidden visibility, or is; ``dso_local``, ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as simply a pointer; to the function.; - ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented with a stub that tail-calls the; function. Many targets support relocations that resolve at link time to either; a function or a stub for it, depending on if the function is defined within the; linkage unit; LLVM will use this when available. (This is commonly called a; ""PLT stub"".) On other targets, the stub may need to be emitted explicitly. This can be used wherever a ``dso_local`` instance of a function is needed without; needing to explicitly make the original function ``dso_local``. An instance where; this can be used is for static offset calculations between a function and some other; ``dso_local`` symbol. This is especially useful for the Relative VTables C++ ABI,; where dynamic relocations for function pointers in VTables can be replaced with; static relocations for offsets between the VTable and virtual functions which; may not be ``dso_local``. This is currently only supported for ELF binary formats. .. _no_cfi:. No CFI; ------. ``no_cfi @func``.

Currently, ATT and Intel are; the only supported dialects. An example is:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void asm inteldialect ""eieio"", """"(). In the case that the inline asm might unwind the stack,; the '``unwind``' keyword must be used, so that the compiler emits; unwinding information:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void asm unwind ""call func"", """"(). If the inline asm unwinds the stack and isn't marked with; the '``unwind``' keyword, the behavior is undefined. If multiple keywords appear, the '``sideeffect``' keyword must come; first, the '``alignstack``' keyword second, the '``inteldialect``' keyword; third and the '``unwind``' keyword last. Inline Asm Constraint String; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The constraint list is a comma-separated string, each element containing one or; more constraint codes. For each element in the constraint list an appropriate register or memory; operand will be chosen, and it will be made available to assembly template; string expansion as ``$0`` for the first constraint in the list, ``$1`` for the; second, etc. There are three different types of constraints, which are distinguished by a; prefix symbol in front of the constraint code: Output, Input, and Clobber. The; constraints must always be given in that order: outputs first, then inputs, then; clobbers. They cannot be intermingled. There are also three different categories of constraint codes:. - Register constraint. This is either a register class, or a fixed physical; register. This kind of constraint will allocate a register, and if necessary,; bitcast the argument or result to the appropriate type.; - Memory constraint. This kind of constraint is for use with an instruction; taking a memory operand. Different constraints allow for different addressing; modes used by the target.; - Immediate value constraint.

This kind of constraint will allocate a register, and if necessary,; bitcast the argument or result to the appropriate type.; - Memory constraint. This kind of constraint is for use with an instruction; taking a memory operand. Different constraints allow for different addressing; modes used by the target.; - Immediate value constraint. This kind of constraint is for an integer or other; immediate value which can be rendered directly into an instruction. The; various target-specific constraints allow the selection of a value in the; proper range for the instruction you wish to use it with. Output constraints; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Output constraints are specified by an ""``=``"" prefix (e.g. ""``=r``""). This; indicates that the assembly will write to this operand, and the operand will; then be made available as a return value of the ``asm`` expression. Output; constraints do not consume an argument from the call instruction. (Except, see; below about indirect outputs). Normally, it is expected that no output locations are written to by the assembly; expression until *all* of the inputs have been read. As such, LLVM may assign; the same register to an output and an input. If this is not safe (e.g. if the; assembly contains two instructions, where the first writes to one output, and; the second reads an input and writes to a second output), then the ""``&``""; modifier must be used (e.g. ""``=&r``"") to specify that the output is an; ""early-clobber"" output. Marking an output as ""early-clobber"" ensures that LLVM; will not use the same register for any inputs (other than an input tied to this; output). Input constraints; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Input constraints do not have a prefix -- just the constraint codes.

""``im``""; or ""``{eax}m``"". This means ""choose any of the options in the set"". The; choice of constraint is made independently for each constraint in the; constraint list. 2) Use ""``|``"" between constraint code sets, creating alternatives. Every; constraint in the constraint list must have the same number of alternative; sets. With this syntax, the same alternative in *all* of the items in the; constraint list will be chosen together. Putting those together, you might have a two operand constraint string like; ``""rm|r,ri|rm""``. This indicates that if operand 0 is ``r`` or ``m``, then; operand 1 may be one of ``r`` or ``i``. If operand 0 is ``r``, then operand 1; may be one of ``r`` or ``m``. But, operand 0 and 1 cannot both be of type m. However, the use of either of the alternatives features is *NOT* recommended, as; LLVM is not able to make an intelligent choice about which one to use. (At the; point it currently needs to choose, not enough information is available to do so; in a smart way.) Thus, it simply tries to make a choice that's most likely to; compile, not one that will be optimal performance. (e.g., given ""``rm``"", it'll; always choose to use memory, not registers). And, if given multiple registers,; or multiple register classes, it will simply choose the first one. (In fact, it; doesn't currently even ensure explicitly specified physical registers are; unique, so specifying multiple physical registers as alternatives, like; ``{r11}{r12},{r11}{r12}``, will assign r11 to both operands, not at all what was; intended.).

Fixed Point Arithmetic Intrinsics; ---------------------------------. A fixed point number represents a real data type for a number that has a fixed; number of digits after a radix point (equivalent to the decimal point '.').; The number of digits after the radix point is referred as the `scale`. These; are useful for representing fractional values to a specific precision. The; following intrinsics perform fixed point arithmetic operations on 2 operands; of the same scale, specified as the third argument. The ``llvm.*mul.fix`` family of intrinsic functions represents a multiplication; of fixed point numbers through scaled integers.

For each of these functions, if the result cannot be represented exactly with; the provided scale, the result is rounded.
