If you want to use gArray in the same script as its declaration, you can do so. However, if you want use the script in the interpreter you have to bracket the usage of gArray between #if's, since the definition is not visible. If you add the following preprocessor statements:; #if !defined(__CLING__); int gArray[] = { 2, 3, 4};; #elif defined(__ROOTCLING__); int gArray[];; #endif; gArray will be visible to rootcling but still not visible to Cling. If you use ACLiC, gArray will be available at the command line and be initialized properly by the compiled code.; We recommend you always write scripts with the needed include statements. In most cases, the script will still run with the interpreter. However, a few header files are not handled very well by Cling.; These types of headers can be included in interpreted and compiled mode:. The subset of standard C/C++ headers defined in $ROOTSYS/Cling/include.; Headers of classes defined in a previously loaded library (including ROOT own). The defined class must have a name known to ROOT (i.e. a class with a ClassDef). Hiding header files from rootcling that are necessary for the compiler but optional for the interpreter can lead to a subtle but fatal error. For example:; #ifndef __CLING__; #include ""TTree.h""; #else; class TTree;; #endif. class subTree : public TTree {; };; In this case, rootcling does not have enough information about the TTree class to produce the correct dictionary file. If you try this, rootcling and compiling will be error free, however, instantiating a subTree object from the Cling command line will cause a fatal error. In general, it is recommended to let rootcling see as many header files as possible.; 7.5 Classes Defined By Scripts; Lets create a small class TMyClass and a derived class TChild.

First, let’s see how it is done in the GUI.; 9.2.1.1 The Left Mouse Button; As was just seen moving or resizing an object is done with the left mouse button. The cursor changes its shape to indicate what may be done:; Point the object or one part of it: ; Rotate: ; Resize (exists also for the other directions): ; Enlarge (used for text): ; Move: ; Here are some examples of:; Moving: Resizing: ; Rotating: ; 9.2.1.2 With C++ Statements (Programmatically); How would one move an object in a script? Since there is a tight correspondence between what is seen on the screen and the object in memory, changing the object changes it on the screen. For example, try to do:; root[] a.SetX1(0.9); This should change one of the coordinates of our line, but nothing happens on the screen. Why is that? In short, the canvas is not updated with each change for performance reasons. See “Updating the Pad”.; 9.2.2 Selecting Objects; 9.2.2.1 The Middle Mouse Button; Objects in a canvas, as well as in a pad, are stacked on top of each other in the order they were drawn. Some objects may become “active” objects, which mean they are reordered to be on top of the others. To interactively make an object “active”, you can use the middle mouse button. In case of canvases or pads, the border becomes highlighted when it is active.; 9.2.2.2 With C++ Statements (Programmatically); Frequently we want to draw in different canvases or pads. By default, the objects are drawn in the active canvas. To activate a canvas you can use the TPad::cd() method.; root[] c1->cd(); 9.2.3 Context Menus: the Right Mouse Button; The context menus are a way to interactively call certain methods of an object. When designing a class, the programmer can add methods to the context menu of the object by making minor changes to the header file.; 9.2.3.1 Usin",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This method actually does the event reaction. Its prototype is where px and py are the coordinates at which the event occurred, except if the event is a key press, in which case px contains the key code.; void ExecuteEvent(Int_t event, Int_t px, Int_t py);; Where event is the event that occurs and is one of the following (defined in Buttons.h):; kNoEvent, kButton1Down, kButton2Down,; kButton3Down, kKeyDown, kButton1Up,; kButton2Up, kButton3Up, kButton1Motion,; kButton2Motion, kButton3Motion, kKeyPress,; kButton1Locate, kButton2Locate, kButton3Locate,; kKeyUp, kButton1Double, kButton2Double,; kButton3Double, kMouseMotion, kMouseEnter,; kMouseLeave; We hope the names are self-explanatory.; Designing an ExecuteEvent method is not very easy, except if one wants very basic treatment. We will not go into that and let the reader refer to the sources of classes like TLine or TBox. Go and look at their ExecuteEvent method! We can nevertheless give some reference to the various actions that may be performed. For example, one often wants to change the shape of the cursor when passing on top of an object. This is done with the SetCursor method:; gPad->SetCursor(cursor); The argument cursor is the type of cursor. It may be:; kBottomLeft, kBottomRight, kTopLeft,; kTopRight, kBottomSide, kLeftSide,; kTopSide, kRightSide, kMove,; kCross, kArrowHor, kArrowVer,; kHand, kRotate, kPointer,; kArrowRight, kCaret, kWatch; They are defined in TVirtualX.h and again we hope the names are self-explanatory. If not, try them by designing a small class. It may derive from something already known like TLine.; Note that the ExecuteEvent() functions may in turn; invoke such functions for other objects, in case an object is drawn using other objects. You can also exploit at best the virtues of inheritance. See for example how the class TArrow (derived from TLine) use or redefine the picking functions in its base class.; The last comment is that mous",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This statement calls method of TObject that just adds the pointer of the object, here a histogram, to the list of objects attached to the current pad. Since this is a TObject’s method, every object may be “drawn”, which means attached to a pad.; When is the painting done then ? The answer is: when needed. Every object that derives from TObject has a Paint() method. It may be empty, but for graphical objects, this routine contains all the instructions to paint effectively it in the active pad. Since a Pad has the list of objects it owns, it will call successively the Paint() method of each object, thus re-painting the whole pad on the screen. If the object is a sub-pad, its Paint() method will call the Paint() method of the objects attached, recursively calling Paint() for all the objects. Pad painting. In some cases a pad need to be painted during a macro execution. To force the pad painting gPad->Update() (see next section) should be performed.; The list of primitives stored in the pad is also used to pick objects and to interact with them.; 9.3.1 The Global Pad: gPad; When an object is drawn, it is always in the so-called active pad. For every day use, it is comfortable to be able to access the active pad, whatever it is. For that purpose, there is a global pointer, called gPad. It is always pointing to the active pad. If you want to change the fill color of the active pad to blue but you do not know its name, do this.; root[] gPad->SetFillColor(38); To get the list of colors, go to the paragraph “Color and color palettes” or if you have an opened canvas, click on the View menu, selecting the Colors item.; 9.3.1.1 Finding an Object in a Pad; Now that we have a pointer to the active pad, gPad and that we know this pad contains some objects, it is sometimes interesting to access one of those objects.

Dividing a pad into 6 sub-pads. If pad1 is a pad then, it will divide the pad into 3 columns of 2 sub-pads. The generated sub-pads get names pad1_i where the index i=1 to nxm (in our case pad1_1, pad1_2…pad1_6). The names pad1_1etc… correspond to new variables in Cling, so you may use them as soon as the executed method was pad->Divide(). However, in a compiled program, one has to access these objects. Remember that a pad contains other objects and that these objects may themselves be pads. So we can use the GetPrimitive() method:; TPad* pad1_1 = (TPad*)(pad1->GetPrimitive(""pad1_1"")); One question remains. In case one does an automatic divide, how one can set the default margins between pads? This is done by adding two parameters to Divide(), which are the margins in x and y:; root[] pad1->Divide(3,2,0.1,0.1); The margins are here set to 10% of the parent pad width.; 9.3.5 Updating the Pad; For performance reasons, a pad is not updated with every change. For example, changing the coordinates of the pad does not automatically redraw it. Instead, the pad has a “bit-modified” that triggers a redraw. This bit is automatically set by:. Touching the pad with the mouse - for example resizing it with the mouse.; Finishing the execution of a script.; Adding a new primitive or modifying some primitives for example the name and title of an object.; You can also set the “bit-modified” explicitly with the Modified method:; // the pad has changed; root[] pad1->Modified(); // recursively update all modified pads:; root[] c1->Update(); A subsequent call to TCanvas::Update() scans the list of sub-pads and repaints the pads declared modified. In compiled code or in a long macro, you may want to access an object created during the paint process. To do so, you can force the painting with a TCanvas::Update(). For example, a TGraph creates a histogram (TH1) to paint itself.

The marker constructor is:; TMarker(Double_t x,Double_t y,Int_t marker); The parameters x and y are the marker coordinates and marker is the marker type, shown in the previous figure. Suppose the pointer ma is a valid marker. The marker size is set via ma->SetMarkerSize(size), where size is the desired size. Note, that the marker types 1, 6 and 7 (the dots) cannot be scaled. They are always drawn with the same number of pixels. SetMarkerSize does not apply on them. To have a “scalable dot” a circle shape should be used instead, for example, the marker type 20. The default marker type is 1, if SetMarkerStyle is not specified. It is the most common one to draw scatter plots. Different marker sizes. Different marker sizes. The user interface for changing the marker color, style and size looks like shown in this picture.

The editor can be activated by selecting the Editor menu entry in the canvas View menu or one of the context menu entries for setting line, fill, marker or text attributes. The following object editors are available for the current ROOT version.; 9.7.1 TAxisEditor. This user interface gives the possibility for changing the following axis attributes:. color of the selected axis, the axis’ title and labels;; the length of thick parameters and the possibility to set them on both axis sides (if +- is selected);; to set logarithmic or linear scale along the selected axis with a choice for optimized or more logarithmic labels;; primary, secondary and tertiary axis divisions can be set via the three number fields;; the axis title can be added or edited and the title’s color, position, offset, size and font can be set interactively;; the color, size, and offset of axis labels can be set similarly. In addition, there is a check box for no exponent choice, and another one for setting the same decimal part for all labels. 9.7.2 TPadEditor. It provides the following user interface:; Fixed aspect ratio - can be set for pad resizing.; Edit - sets pad or canvas as editable.; Cross-hair - sets a cross hair on the pad.; TickX - set ticks along the X axis.; TickY - set ticks along the Y axis.; GridX - set a grid along the X axis.; GridY - set a grid along the Y axis.; The pad or canvas border size can be set if a sunken or a raised border mode is; selected; no border mode can be set too. 9.8 Copy and Paste; You can make a copy of a canvas using TCanvas::DrawClonePad.

For example if you were to copy the third pad of surfopt canvas to the top left corner of the target canvas you would have to reset the coordinates of the cloned pad.; 9.9 Legends; Legends for a graph are obtained with a TLegend object. This object points to markers, lines, boxes, histograms, graphs and represent their marker, line, fill attributes. Any object that has a marker or line or fill attribute may have an associated legend. A TLegend is a panel with several entries (class TLegendEntry) and is created by the constructor; TLegend(Double_t x1, Double_t y1, Double_t x2, Double_t y2,; const char *header, Option_t *option); The legend is defined with default coordinates, border size and option. The legend coordinates (NDC) in the current pad are x1, y1, x2, y2. The default text attributes for the legend are:. Alignment = 12 left adjusted and vertically centered; Angle = 0 (degrees); Color = 1 (black); Size = calculate when number of entries is known; Font = helvetica-medium-r-normal scalable font = 42, and bold = 62 for title. The title is a regular entry and supports TLatex. The default is no title (header = 0). The options are the same as for TPave; by default, they are “brand”. Once the legend box is created, one has to add the text with the AddEntry() method:; TLegendEntry* TLegend::AddEntry(TObject *obj,; const char *label,; Option_t *option); The parameters are:. *objis a pointer to an object having marker, line, or fill attributes (a histogram, or a graph); label is the label to be associated to the object; option:; “L” draw line associated with line attributes of obj, if obj inherits from TAttLine.; “P” draw poly-marker associated with marker attributes of obj, if obj inherits TAttMarker.; “F” draw a box with fill associated with fill attributes of obj, if obj inherits TAttFill.

If optdate is non-null, the current date/time will be printed in the canvas. The position of the date string can be controlled by: optdate = 10*format+mode; mode = 1 the date is printed in the bottom/left corner; mode = 2 date is printed in the bottom/right corner; mode = 3 date is printed in the top/right corner; format = 0 (default) date format is like: “Wed Sep 25 17:10:35 2002”; format = 1 date format is: “2002-09-25”; format = 2 date format is: “2002-09-25 17:10:35”. 9.13 3D Viewers; ROOT provides several viewers capable of displaying 3D content:. the Pad - simple line drawing using TPad and associated projection class TView;; GL Viewer - high quality and performance viewer(See “The GL Viewer”);; X3D viewer - simple legacy viewer (See “The X3D Viewer”);; GL-in-pad - combination of basic GL viewer in TPad, with no hardware acceleration. The X3D and GL viewers are created as external windows, associated with a pad, and displaying the same content as it. Only these external viewers are detailed here - for Pad (TPad, TView classes) you should refer to “Graphical Containers: Canvas and Pad” and the class definitions.; All viewers use a common architecture to publish 3D objects to the viewer - described in “Common 3D Viewer Architecture” below. In most cases, you will not need to use this, working instead with a package, such as the “The Geometry Package”, which provides comprehensive, high level functionality to create and place objects into complex 3D scenes, and uses the viewer architecture internally to show the result in your chosen viewer.; 9.13.1 Invoking a 3D viewer; A 3D viewer can be created in a script by passing the appropriate option to Draw()when attaching the dra",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

They allow our simple x3d viewer, and considerably more sophisticated OpenGL one to both work with both geometry libraries (g3d and geom) efficiently.; In addition to external viewers, created in separate windows, this architecture is also used by internal TPad drawing when it requires 3D projections. Publishing to a viewer consists of the following steps:; 1- Create / obtain viewer handle.; 2- Begin scene on viewer.; 3- Fill mandatory parts of TBuffer3D describing object.; 4- Add to viewer.; 5- Fill optional parts of TBuffer3D as requested by viewer.; [ …. repeat 3/4/5 as required for other/child objects]; 6- End scene on viewer.; You should attach the top-level node of your external geometry (or the manager) to a TPad object using TObject::Draw(), and perform the publishing to the viewer in your object’s TObject::Paint() overloaded method. See “Scene Rebuilds”, and example scripts, for more details.; 9.13.4.1 Creating / Obtaining Viewer Handle; External viewers are bound to a TPad object (this may be removed as a requirement in the future). You can create or obtain the current viewer handle via the method:; TVirtualViewer3D * v = gPad->GetViewer3D(""type"");; Here the “type” string defines the viewer type - currently one of:. “ogl” : External GL viewer; “x3d”: External X3D viewer; “pad”: Pad viewer.

You can always test if the scene is already open for object addition with:; viewer->BuildingScene();. Overview of 3D viewer architecture. Note: the x3d viewer does not support rebuilding of scenes - objects added after the first Open/Close Scene pair will be ignored.; 9.13.4.3 Describing Objects - Filling TBuffer3D; The viewers behind the TVirtualViewer3D interface differ greatly in their capabilities e.g. Some support native shape (e.g. spheres/tubes in OpenGL) and can draw these based on an abstract description. Others always require a tessellation description based on TBuffer3D’s kRaw / kRawSizes points/lines/segments sections.; Some need the 3D object positions in the master (world) frame, others can cope with local frames and a translation matrix to place the object",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This enables a viewer, which knows how to draw (tessellate) the shape itself to do so, while providing a generic fallback suitable for all viewers. The rules for client negotiation with the viewer are:. If suitable specialized TBuffer3D class exists, use it, otherwise use TBuffer3D.; Complete the mandatory kCore section.; Complete the kShapeSpecific section if applicable.; Complete the kBoundingBox if you can.; Pass this buffer to the viewer using one of the TBuffer3D::AddObject() methods. If the viewer requires more sections to be completed (kRaw/kRawSizes) TBuffer3D::AddObject() will return flags indicating which ones, otherwise it returns kNone. If requested, you must fill the buffer, mark these sections valid, and call TBuffer3D::AddObject again, to complete adding the object. For example, in out TGeo geometry package, in TGeoPainter::PaintShape, we perform the negotiation with viewer:; TVirtualViewer3D * viewer = gPad->GetViewer3D();; if (shape.IsA() != TGeoCompositeShape::Class()) {; // Does viewer prefer local frame positions?; Bool_t localFrame = viewer->PreferLocalFrame();; // Perform first fetch of buffer from the shape and adding; // it to the viewer; const TBuffer3D &buffer = shape.GetBuffer3D(TBuffer3D::kCore |; TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox |; TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific, localFrame);; Int_t reqSections = viewer->AddObject(buffer, &addDaughters);; // If the viewer requires additional sections fetch from the; // shape (if possible) and add again; if (reqSections != TBuffer3D::kNone) {; shape.GetBuffer3D(reqSections, localFrame);; viewer->AddObject(buffer, &addDaughters);; }; }; The buffer is supplied/filled by the appropriate TShape::GetBuffer3D() and TShape::FillBuffer3D overloads e.g. for a sphere in TGeoSphere.; const TBuffer3D &TGeoSphere::GetBuffer3D(Int_t reqSections,; Bool_t localFrame) const {; // Fills a static 3D buffer and returns",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Add object as a single independent entity in the world reference frame - e.g. a sphere, radius r, at x, y, z.; Repeated placement (copying) in world frame of this locally unique piece of geometry (described in local reference frame) e.g. define a sphere S (radius r), place copy at x1, y1, z1, another copy at x2, y2, z2 etc. The second case is very typical in geometry packages, e.g. ROOT’s TGeo package, GEANT4 etc, where we have very large number repeated placements of relatively few unique “shapes”.; Some viewers (GL Viewer only at present) are able to take advantage of this by identifying unique logical shapes from the fID logical ID member of TBuffer3D. If repeated addition of the same fID is found, the shape is cached already - and the costly tessellation does not need to be sent again. The viewer can also perform internal GL specific caching (display lists) with considerable performance gains in these cases. For this to work correctly the logical object in must be described in TBuffer3D in the local reference frame, complete with the local/master translation. In some cases you will not have a real object you can reasonably set TBuffer3D::fID to, or the object is recycled or temporary. To suppress internal caching in the GL Viewer in these cases, set TBuffer3D::fID to 0 (null).; The viewer indicates it can support local frame objects through the TVirtualViewer3D interface method: PreferLocalFrame(). If this returns kTRUE you can make repeated calls to AddObject(), with TBuffer3D containing the same fID, and different fLocalMaster placements.; For viewers supporting logical/physical objects, the TBuffer3D content refers to the properties of the logical object, with the exception of:. fLocalMaster tran",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The browser shows several folders under //root.; New folders can be added and removed to/from a folder.; 10.2 Why Use Folders?; One reason to use folders is to reduce class dependencies and improve modularity.

It does not write the buffer to a file, it simply populates a buffer with bytes representing the object. This allows us to write the buffer to a file or do anything else we could do with the buffer. For example, we can write it to a socket to send it over the network. This is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is worthwhile to emphasize the need and advantage of separating the creation of the buffer from its use. Let us look how a buffer is written to a file. The dictionary for a class needs to be loaded before any object of that type can be saved.; The TObject::Write method does the following:. Creates a TKey object in the current directory; Creates a TBuffer object which is part of the newly created TKey; Fills the TBuffer with a call to the class::Streamer method; Creates a second buffer for compression, if needed; Reserves space by scanning the TFree list. At this point, the size of the buffer is known.; Writes the buffer to the file; Releases the TBuffer part of the key. In other words, the TObject::Write calls the Streamer method of the class to build the buffer. The buffer is in the key and the key is written to disk. Once written to disk the memory consumed by the buffer part is released. The key part of the TKey is kept. A diagram of a streamed TH1F in the buffer. The key consumes about 60 bytes, whereas the buffer, since it contains the object data, can be very large.; 11.3.9 Ignore Object Streamers; Your class can ignore the TObject Streamerwith the MyClass->Class::IgnoreOb",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

For example, there is a problem with the following scenario: a class Foo has a TClonesArray of Bar objects the Foo object is written with split=0 to Tree T1.

In this case the StreamerInfo for the class Bar is created in optimized mode in such a way that data members of the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In a new program, T1 is read and a new Tree T2 is created with the object Foo in split > 1.; When the T2branch is created, the StreamerInfo for the class Bar is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The optimized Bar StreamerInfo is going to be used to read the TClonesArray in T1. The result will be Bar objects with data member values not in the right sequence. The solution to this problem is to call BypassStreamer(kFALSE) for the TClonesArray. In this case, the normal Bar::Streamer function will be called. The Bar::Streamer function works OK independently if the Bar StreamerInfohad been generated in optimized mode or not.; 11.4 Pointers and References in Persistency; An object pointer as a data member presents a challenge to the streaming software. If the object pointed to is saved every time, it could create circular dependencies and consume a large amount of disk space. The network of references must be preserved on disk and recreated upon reading the file.; If you use independent I/O operations for pointers and their referenced objects you can use the TRef class. Later in this section is an example that compares disk space, memory usage, and I/O times of C++ pointers and TRefs. In general, a TRef is faster than C++ but the advantage of a C++ pointer is that it is already C++.; 11.4.1 Streaming C++ Pointers; When ROOT encounters a pointer data member it calls the Streamer of the object and labels it with a unique object identifier. The object identifier is unique for one I/O operation.

ROOT schema evolution mechanism is automatic and handled by the StreamerInfo.; 11.5.6 Manual Data Model Evolution Capabilities; The automatic data model schema evolution implemented in ROOT makes it possible to read back the serialized data object in the situation when the definition of the classes those objects represent changed slightly (some of the data members were removed or some new ones added). It is also possible to manually specify the rules for more sophisticated data transformations done while reading to load the serialized objects into data structures that changed quite significantly.; ROOT provides two interface enabling users to specify the conversion rules. The first way is to define a rule in the dictionary file and the second way is to insert it to the TClass object using the C++ API.; There are two types of conversion rules. The first of them, the normal rules, are the ones that should be used in the most of the cases. They provide a buffered input data and an address of the in-memory target object and allow user to specify the conversion function mapping the data being read to the output format. The second type of the rules, the raw rules, also provide the pointer to the target object but the input is a raw TBuffer object containing the input data member declared as an input to the rule.

It supports nine levels of compression. The default for ROOT is one. The compression level can be set with the method TFile::SetCompressionLevel. The experience with this algorithm shows that a compression level of 1.3 for raw data files and around two on most DST files is the optimum. The choice of one for the default is a compromise between the time it takes to read and write the object vs. the disk space savings.; To specify no compression, set the level to zero.; We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small compared to the total processing time. If the I/O operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it may compress the data by a factor of 10. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression may have a large impact on the program’s performance.; The compression factor, i.e. the savings of disk space, varies with the type of data. A buffer with a same value array is compressed so that the value is only written once. For example, a track has the mass of a pion that it is always the same, and the charge of the pion that is either positive or negative. For 1000 pions, the mass will be written only once, and the charge only twice (positive and negative). When the data is sparse, i.e. when there are many zeros, the compression factor is also high.

In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects, ROOT has designed the TTree and TNtuple classes specifically for that purpose. The TTree class is optimized to reduce disk space and enhance access speed. A TNtuple is a TTree that is limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a TTree on the other hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to all the simple types.; When using a TTree, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is important to realize that each object is not written individually, but rather collected and written a bunch at a time.; This is where the TTree takes advantage of compression and will produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the TTree contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects can be compressed.; The TTree reduces the header of each object, but it still contains the class name.

Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the TTree contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects can be compressed.; The TTree reduces the header of each object, but it still contains the class name. Using compression, the class name of each same-class object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using a TTree and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned off, you will not see these large savings.; The TTree is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from any other branch. Now, assume that Px and Py are data members of the event, and we would like to compute Px2 + Py2 for every event and histogram the result.; If we had saved the million events without a TTree we would have to:. read each event in its entirety into memory; extract the Px and Py from the event; compute the sum of the squares; fill a histogram. We would have to do that a million times! This is very time consuming, and we really do not need to read the entire event, every time. All we need are two little data members (Px and Py). On the other hand, if we use a tree with one branch containing Px and another branch containing Py, we can read all values of Px and Py by only reading the Px and Py branches. This makes the use of the TTree very attractive.; 12.2 A Simple TTree; This script builds a TTree from an ASCII file containing statistics about the staff at CERN.

You can build a folder structure and create a tree with branches for each of the sub-folders:; TTree folder_tree(""MyFolderTree"",""/MyFolder"");; The second argument ""/MyFolder""is the top folder, and the “/” signals the TTree constructor that this is a folder not just the title. You fill the tree by placing the data into the folder structure and calling TTree::Fill.; 12.7.2 Tree and TRef Objects; MyTree->BranchRef();; This call requests the construction of an optional branch supporting table of references (TRefTable). This branch (TBranchRef) will keep all the information needed to find the branches containing referenced objects at each Tree::Fill, the branch numbers containing the referenced objects are saved in the table of references. When the Tree header is saved (via TTree::Write for example), the branch is saved, keeping the information with the pointers to the branches having referenced objects. Enabling this optional table, allow TTree::Draw to automatically load the branches needed to dereference a TRef (or TRefArray) object.; 12.7.3 Autosave; Autosave gives the option to save all branch buffers every n byte. We recommend using Autosave for large acquisitions. If the acquisition fails to complete, you can recover the file and all the contents since the last Autosave.

In case an expression is specified, the equivalent expression must be computed when calling GetEntryWithIndex(). To build an index with only majorname, specify minorname=""0"" (default).; Note that once the index is built, it can be saved with the TTree object with:; tree.Write(); //if the file has been open in ""update"" mode; The most convenient place to create the index is at the end of the filling process just before saving the tree header. If a previous index was computed, it is redefined by this new call.; Note that this function can also be applied to a TChain. The return value is the number of entries in the Index (< 0 indicates failure).; 12.8 Branches; The organization of branches allows the designer to optimize the data for the anticipated use. The class for a branch is called TBranch. If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches. If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates on it. A variable on a TBranch is called a leaf (yes - TLeaf). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that branches of the same TTree can be written to separate files. To add a TBranch to a TTree we call the method TTree::Branch(). Note that we DO NOT use the TBranch constructor.; The TTree::Branch method has several signatures. The branch type differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a TList, or an array of objects.

In case of many branches (say more than 100), you should adjust the buffer size accordingly. A recommended buffer size is 32000 bytes if you have less than 50 branches. Around 16000 bytes if you have less than 100 branches and 4000 bytes if you have more than 500 branches. These numbers are recommended for computers with memory size ranging from 32MB to 256MB. If you have more memory, you should specify larger buffer sizes. However, in this case, do not forget that your file might be used on another machine with a smaller memory configuration.; 12.10.1.2 Performance Considerations when Splitting a Branch; A split branch is faster to read, but slightly slower to write. The reading is quicker because variables of the same type are stored consecutively and the type does not have to be read each time. It is slower to write because of the large number of buffers as described above. See ""; Performance Benchmarks"" for performance impact of split and non-split mode.; 12.10.1.3 Rules for Splitting; When splitting a branch, variables of different types are handled differently. Here are the rules that apply when splitting a branch. If a data member is a basic type, it becomes one branch of class TBranchElement.; A data member can be an array of basic types. In this case, one single branch is created for the array.; A data member can be a pointer to an array of basic types. The length can vary, and must be specified in the comment field of the data member in the class definition. See “Input/Output”.; Pointer data member are not split, except for pointers to a TClonesArray. The TClonesArray (pointed to) is split if the split level is greater than two.

The examples are:. tree1.C: a tree with several simple (integers and floating point) variables.; tree2.C: a tree built from a C structure (struct). This example uses the Geant3 C wrapper as an example of a FORTRAN common block ported to C with a C structure.; tree3.C: in this example, we will show how to extend a tree with a branch from another tree with the Friends feature. These trees have branches with variable length arrays. Each entry has a variable number of tracks, and each track has several variables.; tree4.C: a tree with a class (Event). The class Event is defined in $ROOTSYS/test. In this example we first encounter the impact of splitting a branch. Each script contains the main function, with the same name as the file (i.e. tree1), the function to write - tree1w, and the function to read - tree1r. If the script is not run in batch mode, it displays the tree in the browser and tree viewer. To study the example scripts, you can either execute the main script, or load the script and execute a specific function. For example:; // execute the function that writes, reads, shows the tree; root[] x tree1.C; // use ACLiC to build shared library, check syntax, execute; root[] x tree1.C++; // Load the script and select a function to execute; root[] L tree1.C; root[] tree1w(); root[] tree1r(); 12.14 Example 1: A Tree with Simple Variables; This example shows how to write, view, and read a tree with several simple (integers and floating-point) variables.; 12.14.1 Writing the Tree; Below is the function that writes the tree (tree1w).

Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification. Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We encourage you to use TTree::AddFriend rather than adding a branch manually.; 12.16.2 TTree::AddFriend; A tree keeps a list of friends. In the context of a tree (or a chain), friendship means unrestricted access to the friends data. In this way it is much like adding another branch to the tree without taking the risk of damaging it. To add a friend to the list, you can use the TTree::AddFriend method. The TTree (tree) below has two friends (ft1 and ft2) and now has access to the variables a,b,c,i,j,k,l and m. The AddFriend method has two parameters, the first is the tree name and the second is the name of the ROOT file where the friend tree is saved. AddFriend automatically opens the friend file. If no file name is given, the tree called ft1 is assumed to be in the same file as the original tree.; tree.AddFriend(""ft1"",""friendfil",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

TEntryList, however, uses considerably less memory for storage, and is optimized for both very high and very low selectivity of cuts (see TEntryListBlock class description for the details of internal storage). Unlike the TEventList, TEntryList makes a distinction between indices from a TChain and from a TTree. While a TEntryList for a TTree can be seen as just a list of numbers, a TEntryList for a TChain is a collection of TEntryList(s) for the TTree(s) that constitute this TChain. Such “sub-lists” can be extracted by calling the function; TEntryList::GetEntryList(const char *treename, const char *filename); and then be used to construct a new TEntryList for a new TChain, or processed independently as normal TEntryList(s) for TTree(s). This modularity makes TEntryList much better suited for PROOF processing than the TEventList.; 12.20.10.2 Using an Event List; A TEventList or a TEntryList can be used to limit the TTree to the events in the list.

The methods SetEventList and SetEntryList tell the tree to use the list and hence limit all subsequent calls to Draw, Scan, Process, Query, Principal and CopyTree methods to the entries in the list. In general, it affects the GetEntryNumber method and all functions using it for looping over the tree entries. The GetEntry and GetEntries methods are not affected. Note, that in the SetEventList method, the TEventList argument is internally transformed into a TEntryList, and this operation, in case of a TChain, requires loading of all the tree headers. In this example, we create a list with all entries with more than 600 tracks and then set it so that the tree will use this list. To reset the TTree to use all events use SetEventList(0) or SetEntryList(0). Let’s look at an example. First, open the file and draw the fNtrack. root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root"");; root[] TTree *T = (TTree*)f->Get(""T"");; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack"");. Now, put the entries with over 600 tracks into a TEntryList called myList. We get the list from the current directory and assign it to a variable list. root[] T->Draw("">>myList"",""fNtrack > 600"",""entrylist"");; root[] TEntryList *list=(TEntryList*)gDirectory->Get(""myList"");. Instruct the tree T to use the new list and draw it again. Note that this is exactly the same Draw command.

In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to deal with machine independent binary files. On Linux, this also includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an event when split=1.; Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7 Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program Event will report the write performance. You can measure the read performance by executing the scripts eventa and eventb. The performance depends not only of the processor type, but also of the disk devices (local, NFS, AFS, etc.).; 12.24 Chains. A TChain object is a list of ROOT files containing the same tree.

The latest developments have been concentrated in providing first versions of the MathCore and MathMore libraries, included in ROOT v5.08. Other recent developments include the new version of MINUIT, which has been re-designed and re-implemented in the C++ language. It is integrated in ROOT. In addition, an optimized package for describing small matrices and vector with fixed sizes and their operation has been developed (SMatrix). The structure is shown in the following picture. Math libraries and packages. 13.1 MathCore Library; MathCore provides a collection of functions and C++ classes for numerical computing. This library includes only the basic mathematical functions and algorithms and not all the functionality required by the physics community. A more advanced mathematical functionality is provided by the MathMore library. The current set of included classes, which are provided in the ROOT::Math namespace are:. Basic special functions like the gamma, beta and error function.; Mathematical functions used in statistics, such as the probability density functions and the cumulative distributions functions (lower and upper integral of the pdf’s).; Generic function classes and interfaces for evaluating one-dimensional (ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctiononeDim) and multi-dimensional functions (ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim) and parametric function",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

These interfaces define the integrator functionality with abstract methods to set the function, to compute the integral or to set the integration tolerance. These methods must be implemented in the concrete classes existing for the different integration algorithms. The user cannot create directly these virtual integrator interfaces. He needs to create the ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim class for integrating one-dimensional functions and ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim for multi-dimensional functions. Through the ROOT Plug-In Manager, the user can initialize ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim or ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim with any of the concrete integration classes without dealing with them directly. These two classes provide the same interface as in VirtualIntegratorOneDim and VirtualIntegratorMultiDim, but with the possibility to choose in the constructor, which method will be used to perform the integration.; The method to set the function to be integrated, must be of the function interface type described before. ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDimFunction is used for ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim and The only difference between the ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim and ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim resides in the dimensionality of that function and some specific that will be seen afterwards for the one dimensional one. ROOT::Math Numerical Integrator classes. The rest of the classes shown above in the diagram are the specialized classes provided. Each one implements a different method that will be explained in detail. It is important to notice that the two grayed classes (the one which name starts by GSL) are part of the MathMore library.

It is possible to specify the begin and end of the iterator or the begin and the size.

In the case of a small matrix, a faster direct inversion is used.

The user can define customized matrix operations through the classes TElementActionD and TElementsPosActionD. Overview of matrix classes. Reference to different views of the matrix can be created through the classes on the right-hand side, see “Matrix Views”. These references provide a natural connection to vectors.; Matrix decompositions (used in equation solving and matrix inversion) are available through the classes on the left-hand side (see “Matrix Decompositions”). They inherit from the TDecompBase class. The Eigen Analysis is performed through the classes at the top, see “Matrix Eigen Analysis”. In both cases, only some matrix types can be analyzed. For instance, TDecompChol will only accept symmetric matrices as defined TMatrixDSym. The assignment operator behaves somewhat different than of most other classes. The following lines will result in an error:; TMatrixD a(3,4);; TMatrixD b(5,6);; b = a;; It required to first resize matrix b to the shape of a.; TMatrixD a(3,4);; TMatrixD b(5,6);; b.ResizeTo(a);; b = a;; 14.2 Matrix Properties; A matrix has five properties, which are all set in the constructor:. precision - float or double.

It gives the user a tool to monitor and steer the operations its default value is \(\varepsilon\) where \(1+\varepsilon=1\).; If you do not want to be bothered by the following considerations, like in most other linear algebra packages, just set the tolerance with SetTol to an arbitrary small number. The tolerance number is used by each decomposition method to decide whether the matrix is near singular, except of course SVD that can handle singular matrices. This will be checked in a different way for any decomposition. For instance in LU, a matrix is considered singular in the solving stage when a diagonal element of the decomposed matrix is smaller than fTol. Here an important point is raised. The Decompose() method is successful as long no zero diagonal element is encountered. Therefore, the user could perform decomposition and only after this step worry about the tolerance number.; If the matrix is flagged as being singular, operations with the decomposition will fail and will return matrices or vectors that are invalid. If one would like to monitor the tolerance parameter but not have the code stop in case of a number smaller than fTol, one could proceed as follows:; TVectorD b = ..;; TMatrixD a = ..;; .; TDecompLU lu(a);; Bool_t ok;; TVectorD x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; Int_t nr = 0;; while (!ok) {; lu.SetMatrix(a);; lu.SetTol(0.1*lu.GetTol());; if (nr++ > 10) break;; x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; }; if (x.IsValid()); cout << ""solved with tol ="" << lu.GetTol() << endl;; else; cout << ""solving failed "" << endl;; The observant reader will notice that by scaling the complete matrix by some small number the decomposition will detect a singular matrix.

Next figure shows the CPU time for these four operations as a function of the matrix size:. A*B The execution time is measured for the sum of A * Bsym, Bsym* A and A * B. Notice the matrix_size3 dependence of execution time. CLHEP results are hampered by a poor implementation of symmetric matrix multiplications. For instance, for general matrices of size 100x100, the time is 0.015 sec. while A * Bsym takes 0.028 sec and Bsym* A takes 0.059 sec.

In order to gain speed the CLHEP algorithm stores its permutation info of the pivots points in a static array, making multi-threading not possible. GSL uses LU decomposition without the implicit scaling of Crout. Therefore, its accuracy is not as good. For instance a (10x10) Hilbert matrix has errors 10 times larger than the LU Crout result. In ROOT v4.0, the user can choose between the Invert() and IvertFast() routines, where the latter is using the Cramer algorithm for sizes<7x7. The speed graph shows the result for InvertFast(). A*x=b the execution time is measured for solving the linear equation A*x=b. The same factorizations are used as in the matrix inversion. However, only 1 forward/back-substitution has to be used instead of msize as in the inversion of (msize x msize) matrix. As a consequence the same differences are observed but less amplified.

These include:. Next Returns the next member of the collection or 0 if no more members.; Reset Resets the iterator so that Next returns the first object. 16.4 A Collectable Class; By default, all objects of TObject derived classes can be stored in ROOT containers. However, the TObject class provides some member functions that allow you to tune the behavior of objects in containers. For example, by default two objects are considered equal if their pointers point to the same address. This might be too strict for some classes where equality is already achieved if some or all of the data members are equal. By overriding the following TObject member functions, you can change the behavior of objects in collections:. IsEqual()is used by the FindObject()collection method. By default, IsEqual() compares the two object pointers.; Compare()returns -1, 0 or 1 depending if the object is smaller, equal or larger than the other object. By default, a TObject has not a valid Compare() method.; IsSortable()returns true if the class is sort able (i.e. if it has a valid Compare() method). By default, a TObject is not sort able.; Hash()returns a hash value.

Objects can be directly accessed via an index. The array expands automatically when objects are added. At creation time one specifies the default array size (default = 16) and lower bound (default = 0). Resizing involves a re-allocation and a copy of the old array to the new. This can be costly if done too often. If possible, set initial size close to expected final size. Index validity is always checked (if you are 100% sure and maximum performance is needed you can use UnCheckedAt() instead of At() or operator[]). If the stored objects are sort able the array can be sorted using Sort(). Once sorted, efficient searching is possible via the BinarySearch() method.

You will notice that this is a bit more complex that just creating the “world” since several other volumes are created and put together in a hierarchy. The purpose here is just to learn how to interact with a geometry that is already built, but just few hints on the building steps in this example might be useful. The geometry here represents the word ROOT that is replicated in some symmetric manner. You might for instance ask some questions after having a first look:; Q: “OK, I understand the first lines that load the libGeom library and create a geometry manager object. I also recognize from the previous example the following lines creating some materials and media, but what about the geometrical transformations below?”; A: As explained before, the model that we are trying to create is a hierarchy of volumes based on containment. This is accomplished by positioning some volumes inside others. Any volume is an un-positioned object in the sense that it defines only a local frame (matching the one of its shape). In order to fully define the mother-daughter relationship between two volumes one has to specify how the daughter will be positioned inside. This is accomplished by defining a local geometrical transformation of the daughter with respect to the mother coordinate system. These transformations will be subsequently used in the example.; Q: “I see the lines defining the top level volume as in the previous example, but what about the other volumes named REPLICA and",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html
https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html:882349,Performance,perform,performing,882349," the letters R, O and T. Why one have to define so many volumes to make an R?”; A: Well, in real life some objects have much more complex shapes that an R. The modeller cannot just know all of them; the idea is to make a complex object by using elementary building blocks that have known shapes (called primitive shapes). Gluing these together in the appropriate way is the user responsibility.; Q: “I am getting the global picture but not making much out of it… There are also a lot of calls to TGeoVolume::AddNode() that I do not understand.”; A: A volume is positioned inside another one by using this method. The relative geometrical transformation as well as a copy number must be specified. When positioned, a volume becomes a node of its container and a new object of the class TGeoNode is automatically created. This method is therefore the key element for the creation of a hierarchical link between two volumes. As it will be described further on in this document, there are few other methods performing similar actions, but let us keep things simple for the time being. In addition, notice that there are some visualization-related calls in the example followed by a final TGeoVolume::Draw()call for the top volume. These are explained in details in the section “Visualization Settings and Attributes”. At this point, you will probably like to see how this geometry looks like.

However, there are certain functionalities that work with the assumption that the used lengths are expressed in centimeters. This is the case for shape capacity or volume weight computation. The same is valid when using the ROOT geometry as navigator for an external transport MC package (e.g. GEANT) via the VMC interface.; Other units in use: All angles used for defining rotation matrices or some shape parameters are expressed in degrees. Material density is expressed in [g/cm3].; 18.3.2 Primitive Shapes; 18.3.2.1 Boxes - TGeoBBox Class; Normally a box has to be built only with 3 parameters: DX,DY,DZ representing the half-lengths on X, Y and Z-axes. In this case, the origin of the box will match the one of its reference frame and the box will range from: -DX to DX on X-axis, from -DY to DY on Y and from -DZ to DZ on Z. On the other hand, any other shape needs to compute and store the parameters of their minimal bounding box. The bounding boxes are essential to optimize navigation algorithms. Therefore all other primitives derive from TGeoBBox. Since the minimal bounding box is not necessary centered in the origin, any box allows an origin translation (Ox,Oy,Oz). All primitive constructors automatically compute the bounding box parameters. Users should be aware that building a translated box that will represent a primitive shape by itself would affect any further positioning of other shapes inside. Therefore it is highly recommendable to build non-translated boxes as primitives and translate/rotate their corresponding volumes only during positioning stage.; TGeoBBox(Double_t dx,Double_t dy,Double_t dz,Double_t *origin=0);.

The supported Boolean operations are union (+), intersection (*) and subtraction(-). Composite shapes derive from the base TGeoShape class, therefore providing all shape features: computation of bounding box, finding if a given point is inside or outside the combination, as well as computing the distance to entering/exiting. They can be directly used for creating volumes or used in the definition of other composite shapes.; Composite shapes are provided in order to complement and extend the set of basic shape primitives. They have a binary tree internal structure, therefore all shape-related geometry queries are signals propagated from top level down to the final leaves, while the provided answers are assembled and interpreted back at top. This CSG (composite solid geometry) hierarchy is effective for small number of components, while performance drops dramatically for large structures. Building a complete geometry in this style is virtually possible but highly not recommended.; 18.3.3.1 The Structure of Composite Shapes; A composite shape can always be looked as the result of a Boolean operation between only two shape components. All information identifying these two components as well as their positions with respect to the frame of the composite is represented by an object called Boolean node. A composite shape has a pointer to such a Boolean node. Since the shape components may also be composites, they will also contain binary Boolean nodes branching out other two shapes in the hierarchy. Any such branch ends-up when the final leaves are no longer composite shapes, but basic primitives. The figure shows the composite shapes structure. The composite shapes structure.

A composite shape example. Composite shapes can be subsequently used for defining volumes. Moreover, these volumes contain other volumes, following the general criteria. Volumes created based on composite shapes cannot be divided.; 18.3.4 Navigation Methods Performed By Shapes; Shapes are named objects and register themselves to the manager class at creation time. This is responsible for their final deletion. Shapes can be created without name if their retrieval by name is no needed. Generally shapes are objects that are useful only at geometry creation stage. The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a given volume and it is always accessible at that level. Several volumes may reference a single shape; therefore its deletion is not possible once volumes were defined based on it.; The navigation features related for instance to tracking particles are performed in the following way: Each shape implement its specific algorithms for all required tasks in its local reference system. Note that the manager class handles global queries related to geometry. However, shape-related queries might be sometimes useful:; Bool_t TGeoShape::Contains(Double_t *point[3]);; The method above returns kTRUE if the point *point is actually inside the shape. The point has to be defined in the local shape reference. For instance, for a box having DX,DY and DZhalf-lengths a point will be considered inside if:; -DX <= point[0] <= DX; -DY <= point[1] <= DY; -DZ <= point[2] <= DZ; Double_t TGeoShape::DistFromInside(Double_t *point[3],; Double_t *dir[3], Int_t iact,Double_t step,Double_t *safe);; The method computes the distance to exiting a shape from a given point inside, along a given direction. This direction is given by its director cosines with respect to the local shape coordinate system.

Supported axes are: X, Y, Z, Rxy, Phi, Rxyz. A given shape cannot be divided however on any axis. The general rule is that that divisions are possible on whatever axis that produces still known shapes as slices. The division of shapes are performed by the call TGeoShape::Divide(), but this operation can be done only via TGeoVolume::Divide() method. In other words, the algorithm for dividing a specific shape is known by the shape object, but is always invoked in a generic way from the volume level. Details on how to do that can be found in the paragraph ‘Dividing volumes’. One can see how all division options are interpreted and which their result inside specific shape classes is.; 18.3.7 Parametric Shapes; Shapes generally have a set of parameters that is well defined at build time. In fact, when the final geometrical hierarchy is assembled and the geometry is closed, all constituent shapes MUST**have well defined and valid parameters. In order to ease-up geometry creation, some parameterizations are however allowed.; For instance let’s suppose that we need to define several volumes having exactly the same properties but different sizes. A way to do this would be to create as many different volumes and shapes.

Whenever positioned inside a mother volume, this will create a normal TGeoVolume object having as shape a box with dz fitting the corresponding dzof the mother shape. Generally, this type of parameterization is used when positioning volumes in containers having a matching shape, but it works also for most reasonable combinations.; 18.4 Geometry Creation; A given geometry can be built in various ways, but one has to follow some mandatory steps. Even if we might use some terms that will be explained later, here are few general rules:. Volumes need media and shapes in order to be created.; Both containers and contained volumes must be created before linking them together, and the relative transformation matrix must be provided.; Any volume have to be positioned somewhere otherwise it will not be considered as part of the geometry.; Visibility or tracking properties of volumes can be provided both at build time or after geometry is closed, but global visualization settings (see section: “The Drawing Package”) should not be provided at build time, otherwise the drawing package will be loaded. There is also a list of specific rules:. Positioned volumes should not extrude their container or intersect with others within this unless it is specified (see section: Overlapping Volumes).; The top volume (containing all geometry trees) must be specified before closing the geometry and must not be positioned - it represents the global reference frame.; After building the full geometry tree, the geometry must be closed (see the method TGeoManager::CloseGeometry()). Voxelization can be redone per volume after this process. The list is much bigger and we will describe in more detail the geometry creation procedure in the following sections. Provided that geometry was successfully built and closed, the TGeoManager class will register itself to ROOT and the logical/physical structures will become immediately browsable.; 18.4.1 The Volume Hierarchy; The basic",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The current physical node is not an object that can be asked for at a given moment, but rather represented by the combination: current node/current global matrix. However, physical nodes have unique ID’s that can be retrieved for a given modeller state. These can be fed back to the modeller in order to force a physical node to become current. The advantage of this comes from the fact that all navigation queries check first the current node; therefore the location of a point in the geometry can be saved as a starting state for later use.; Nodes can be declared as overlapping in case they do overlap with other nodes inside the same container or extrude this container (see also ‘Checking the Geometry’). Non-overlapping nodes can be created with:; TGeoVolume::AddNode(TGeoVolume *daughter,Int_t copy_No,; TGeoMatrix *matr);; The creation of overlapping nodes can be done with a similar prototype:; TGeoVolume::AddNodeOverlap(/*same arguments*/);; When closing the geometry, overlapping nodes perform a check of possible overlaps with their neighbors. These are stored and checked all the time during navigation; therefore, navigation is slower when embedding such nodes into geometry. Nodes have visualization attributes as the volume has. When undefined by users, painting a node on a pad will take the corresponding volume attributes.; 18.4.2 Creating and Positioning Volumes; 18.4.2.1 Making Volumes; As mentioned before, volumes are the basic objects used in building the geometrical hierarchy. They represent objects that are not positioned, but store all information about the placement of the other volumes they may contain. Therefore a volume can be replicated several times in the geometry. As it was explained, in order to create a volume, one has to put together a shape and a medium, which are already defined.; Volumes have to be named by users at creation time.

This is more or less the case for detector geometries of complex experiments, where a ‘flat’ CSG model description cannot scale with the current CPU performances. This is the reason why models like GEANT [1] introduced an additional dimension (depth) in order to reduce the complexity of the problem. This concept is also preserved by the ROOT modeller and introduces a pure geometrical constraint between objects (volumes in our case) - containment. This means in fact that any positioned volume has to be contained by another. Now what means contained and positioned?. We will say that a volume contains a point if this is inside the shape associated to the volume. For instance, a volume having a box shape will contain all points P=(X,Y,Z) verifying the conditions: Abs(Pi)dXi. The points on the shape boundaries are considered as inside the volume. The volume contains a daughter if it contains all the points contained by the daughter.; The definition of containment works of course only with points defined in the local coordinate system of the considered volume.

They represent the link elements in the hierarchy of volumes. Nodes are unique and distinct geometrical objects ONLY from their container point of view. Since volumes can be replicated in the geometry, the same node may be found on different branches.; In order to provide navigation features, volumes have to be able to find the proper container of any point defined in the local reference frame. This can be the volume itself, one of its positioned daughter volumes or none if the point is actually outside. On the other hand, volumes have to provide also other navigation methods such as finding the distances to its shape boundaries or which daughter will be crossed first. The implementation of these features is done at shape level, but the local mother-daughters management is handled by volumes. These build additional optimization structures upon geometry closure. In order to have navigation features properly working one has to follow some rules for building a valid geometry. The daughter volume(s) must not extrude the mother shape. They are allowed however to have a common boundaries.; The volumes positioned in the same container must not overlap with each other. They may touch on one boundaries or shape vertex.

This is not always straightforward to accomplish, especially when instead of A and B we have many more volumes.; In order to avoid these problems, one can use for the difficult cases the class TGeoVolumeAssembly, representing an assembly of volumes. This behaves like a normal container volume supporting other volumes positioned inside, but it has neither shape nor medium. It cannot be used directly as a piece of the geometry, but just as a temporary structure helping temporary assembling and positioning volumes.; If we define now C as an assembly containing A and B, positioning the assembly into D,E and F will actually position only A and Bdirectly into these v",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

We will want now to place symmetrically 1000 chambers on a pad, following a pattern of 20 rows and 50 columns. One way to do this will be to replicate our chamber by positioning it 1000 times in different positions of the pad. Unfortunately, this is far from being the optimal way of doing what we want. Imagine that we would like to find out which of the 1000 chambers is containing a (x,y,z) point defined in the pad reference. You will never have to do that, since the modeller will take care of it for you, but let’s guess what it has to do. The most simple algorithm will just loop over all daughters, convert the point from mother to local reference and check if the current chamber contains the point or not. This might be efficient for pads with few chambers, but definitely not for 1000. Fortunately the modeller is smarter than that and creates for each volume some optimization structures called voxels to minimize the penalty having too many daughters, but if you have 100 pads like this in your geometry you will anyway lose a lot in your tracking performance.

The meaning of the axis index is the following: for all volumes having shapes like box, trd1, trd2, trap, gtraorpara -1, 2, 3 mean X, Y, Z; for tube, tubs, cone, cons -1 means Rxy, 2 means phi and 3 means Z; for pcon and pgon - 2 means phi and 3 means Z; for spheres 1 means Rand 2 means phi.; In fact, the division operation has the same effect as positioning volumes in a given order inside the divided container - the advantage being that the navigation in such a structure is much faster. When a volume is divided, a volume family corresponding to the slices is created. In case all slices can be represented by a single shape, only one volume is added to the family and positioned N times inside the divided volume, otherwise, each slice will be represented by a distinct volume in the family.; Divisions can be also performed in a given range of one axis. For that, one has to specify also the starting coordinate value and the step:; TGeoVolume *slicex = box->Divide(""SLICEX"",1,N,start,step);; A check is always done on the resulting division range: if not fitting into the container limits, an error message is posted. If we will browse the divided volume we will notice that it will contain N nodes starting with index 1 up to N. The first one has the lower X limit at START position, while the last one will have the upper X limit at START+N*STEP. The resulting slices cannot be positioned inside another volume (they are by default positioned inside the divided one) but can be further divided and may contain other volumes:; TGeoVolume *slicey = slicex->Divide(""SLICEY"",2,N1);; slicey->AddNode(other_vol,index,some_matrix);; When doing that, we have to remember that SLICEY represents a family, therefore all members of the family will be divided on Y and the other volume will be added as node inside all.; In the exa",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

One of these is that the structure has to be replicated in several parts of the geometry, or it may simply happen that they really represent a single object, too complex to be described by a primitive shape.; Usually handling structures like these can be easily done by positioning all components in the same container volume, then positioning the container itself. However, there are many practical cases when defining such a container is not straightforward or even possible without generating overlaps with the rest of the geometry. There are few ways out of this:. Defining the container for the structure as “overlapping” (see also "" Overlapping Volumes ""); Representing the container as a composite shape - the Boolean union of all components (see also "" Composite Shapes ""); Using an assembly volume - this will be described in the following. The first two approaches have the disadvantage of penalizing the navigation performance with a factor increasing more than linear of the number of components in the structure.

Due to the self-containment of assemblies, they are very practical to use when a container is hard to define due to possible overlaps during positioning.

Again, the ownership of overlapping regions highly depends on the current track parameters.; We must say that even the overlaps of type A) and B) are allowed in case the corresponding nodes are created using TGeoVolume::AddNodeOverlap() method. Navigation is performed in such cases by giving priority to the non-overlapping nodes. The modeller has to perform an additional search through the overlapping candidates. These are detected automatically during the geometry closing procedure in order to optimize the algorithm, but we will stress that extensive usage of this feature leads to a drastic deterioration of performance.

One can then perform mouse/keyboard actions to change them:. Mouse left-click and drag will rotate the view;; Some keys can be pressed when the view canvas is selected: J/K zoom/un-zoom, U/I move up/down, L/H move left/right. The coordinate axes display as well as changing top or side viewpoints can be activated from the TView context menu: right-click on the picture when no object is selected;. Q: “Every line is black!

Think at using them after each volume creation: myvolume->SetLineColor(Int_t color); otherwise everything is by default black.; Q: “The top volume of my geometry is a box but I see only its content.”; A: By default the drawn volume is not displayed just because we do not want to hide its content when changing the view to HLR or solid mode.

You can change this by using: gGeoManager::SetVisLevel(n);; Not only that, but none of the volumes at intermediate levels (0-2) are visible on the drawing unless they are final ‘leaves’ on their branch (e.g. have no other volumes positioned inside). This behavior is the default one and corresponds to ‘leaves’ global visualization mode (TGeoManager::fVisOption = 1). In order to see on the screen the intermediate containers, one can change this mode: gGeoManager->SetVisOption(0).; Q: “Volumes are highlighted when moving the mouse over their vertices. What does it mean?”; A: Indeed, moving the mouse close to some volume vertices selects it. By checking the Event Status entry in the root canvas Options menu, you will see exactly which is the selected node in the bottom right. Right-clicking when a volume is selected will open its context menu where several actions can be performed (e.g. drawing it).; Q: “OK, but now I do not want to see all the geometry, but just a particular volume and its content.

The global visible level put a limitation on the maximum applied depth. Combined with visibility settings per volume, these can tune quite well what should appear on the screen. However, there are situations when users want to see a volume branch displayed down to the maximum depth, keeping at the same time a limitation or even suppressing others. In order to accomplish that, one should use the volume attribute: Visible daughters. By default, all daughters of all volumes are displayed if there is no limitation related with their level depth with respect to the top drawn volume.; 18.7.3 Ray Tracing; Ray tracing is a quite known drawing technique based on tracking rays from the eye position through all pixels of a view port device. The pixel color is derived from the properties of the first crossed surface, according some illumination model and material optical properties. While there are currently existing quite sophisticated ray tracing models, TGeo is currently using a very simple approach where the light source is matching the eye position (no shadows or back-tracing of the reflected ray).

Ray-tracing example with box-clipping. 18.8 Representing Misalignments of the Ideal Geometry; The ideal positioning of a detector does not match its position in the experimental hall. This generally happens not only for the detector modules, but also for their components. The accurate knowledge of the detector real misalignments can be extremely important for getting close to its designed resolution and the expected tracking efficiency. TGeo offers tools for representing positioning misalignments, applying them to the ideal geometry and performing navigation under these conditions. Detector tracking algorithms can then directly query the geometry for navigation purposes or for retrieving actual misalignment information.; 18.8.1 Physical Nodes; Physical nodes are the actual “touchable” objects in the geometry, representing actually a path of positioned volumes starting with the top node: path=/TOP/A_1/B_4/C_3 , where A, B, C represent names of volumes. The number of physical nodes is given by the total number of possible of branches in the geometry hierarchy. In case of detector geometries and specially for calorimeters this number can be of the order 106-109, therefore it is impossible to create all physical nodes as objects in memory. In TGeo, physical nodes are represented by the class TGeoPhysicalNode and can be created on demand for alignment purposes:; TGeoPhysicalNode(const char* path); The knowledge of the path to the objects that need to be misaligned is essential since there is no",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Depending on the extension of the file, the geometry is exported either as ,root file or .C(.cxx) macro or GDML file in case extension is .gdml.; keynameis the name of the key in the file (default """"); opt = ""v"" is an export voxelization (default), otherwise voxelization is recomputed after loading the geometry, ""g"" this option (default) is taken into account only for exporting to gdml file and it ensures compatibility with Geant4 (e.g. it adds extra plane to incorrectly set polycone, it checks whether offset of Phi division is in (-360;0> range, …), for this gdml export there are two more option, that are not set by default: ""f"" and ""n"". If none of this two options are set, then names of solids and volumes in resulting gdml file will have incremental suffix (e.g. TGeoBBox_0x1, TGeoBBox_0x2, …). If ""f"" option is set then then suffix will contain pointer of object (e.g. TGeoBBox_0xAAAAA01, …). Finally if option ""n"" is set then no suffix will be added, though in this case uniqueness of the names is not ensured and it can cause that file will be invalid.

This includes navigation queries at shape level, global geometrical queries and optimization mechanisms.; 18.10.1 Finding the State Corresponding to a Location (x,y,z); For reminder, a geometry state is a ‘touchable’ object in the geometry hierarchy. It is represented by a path like: /TOP_1/A_1/B_3/C_1, where B_3 for instance is a copy of volume B positioned inside volume A. A state is always associated to a transformation matrix M of the touchable with respect to the global reference frame (obtained by piling-up all local transformations of nodes in the branch with respect to their containers). The current state and the corresponding global matrix are updated whenever the geometry depth is modified. The global transformations corresponding to all nodes in the current branch are kept in an array: (MTOP_1, MA_1, MB_3, …). Navigation in the geometry hierarchy. The elementary operations for changing the state are:; TGeoManager::CdUp();; TGeoManager::CdDown(i);; TGeoManager::CdTop(); The current state accounting and global matrix handling a",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Its interoperability with other programming languages, both for extending Python as well as embedding it, is excellent and many existing third-party applications and libraries have therefore so-called “Python bindings.” PyROOT provides Python bindings for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of user-level objects from one interpreter to the other. PyROOT enables access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from the python interpreter.; 19.1 PyROOT Overview; The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming, including high performance and distributed parallel code (see http://www.scipy.org). It is the second most popular scripting language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a “glue language”: practically every library and application these days comes with Python bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated).; PyROOT, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary.

PyROOT enables access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from the python interpreter.; 19.1 PyROOT Overview; The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming, including high performance and distributed parallel code (see http://www.scipy.org). It is the second most popular scripting language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a “glue language”: practically every library and application these days comes with Python bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated).; PyROOT, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus the “glue-ing” of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or applications that provide Python bindings. Further, PyROOT can be loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary) access to Python classes. The best way to understand the benefits of PyROOT is through a few examples.; 19.1.1 Glue-ing Applications; The PyQt library, see http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt, provides Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI framework ( http://www.trolltech.com). With PyROOT and PyQt, adding ROOT application layer code to a Qt GUI, becomes children play. The following example shows how a Python class can be used to have ROOT code respond to a click on a Qt widget.; # Glue-ing Qt and ROOT through Python; import sys, ROOT; from qt import *. theApp = QApplication( sys.argv); box = QVBox(); box.resize(QSize(40,10).expandedTo(box.minimumSizeHint())). class myButton(QPushButton):; def __init__( self,label,master):; QPushButton.__init__(self,label,master); self.setFont( QFont('Times',18,QFont.Bold)). def browse(self):; self.b = ROOT.TBrowser(). bb = myButton('browser',box); QObject.connect( bb,SIGNAL('clicked()'),bb.browse). theA",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Currently, ROOT objects and built-in types can cross the boundary between the two interpreters, but other objects are much more restricted. For example, for a Python object to cross, it has to be a class instance, and its class has to be known to Cling first (i.e. the class has to cross first, before the instance can).

An example session should make this clear:; >>> from ROOT import *; >>> gROOT # directly available; <ROOT.TROOT object at 0x399c30>; >>> gMinuit # library not yet loaded: not available; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in ?; NameError: name 'gMinuit' is not defined; >>> TMinuit # use of TMinuit class forces auto-loading; <class '__main__.TMinuit'>; >>> gMinuit # now gMinuit is available; <__main__.TMinuit object at 0x1458c70>; >>> not not gMinuit # but it is the null pointer, until set; False; >>> g = TMinuit(); >>> not not gMinuit; True; It is also possible to create globals interactively, either by executing a Cling macro, or by a call to gROOT.ProcessLine(). These globals are made available in the same way: either use them directly after creation in ‘from ROOT import *’ more, or get them from the ROOT namespace after an ‘import ROOT’.; As of 5.08, the behaviour of ROOT globals is the same as python globals, which is sometimes counterintuitive: since they are references, they can be changed only if done so directly through their containing module. The following session shows that in detail:; >>> from ROOT import *; >>> print(gDebug); 0; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'gDebug = 7;' ); >>> print(gDe",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The following session shows that in detail:; >>> from ROOT import *; >>> print(gDebug); 0; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'gDebug = 7;' ); >>> print(gDebug); 0 # local gDebug is unchanged; >>> gDebug = 5 # changes _local_ reference only; >>> print(gDebug); 5 # locally correct, but ...; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'cout << gDebug << endl;' ); 7 # ... ROOT global unchanged; >>> import ROOT; >>> print(ROOT.gDebug); 7 # still the old value (not '5'); >>> ROOT.gDebug = 3 # changes ROOT module reference; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'cout << gDebug << endl;' ); 3 # ROOT global properly changed; >>>; The above is another good reason to prefer ‘import ROOT’ over ‘from ROOT import *’.; 19.1.5.4 Access to Python; The access to Python from Cling goes through the TPython class, or directly if a Python object or class has crossed the border. The TPython class, which looks approximately like this:; class TPython {. public:; // load a Python script as if it were a macro; static void LoadMacro(const char* name);. // execute a Python statement (e.g. ""import ROOT""); static void Exec(const char* cmd);. // evaluate a Python expression (e.g. ""1+1""); static const TPyReturn& Eval(const char* expr);. // bind a ROOT object with, at the Python side, the name ""label""; static bool Bind(TObject* obj,const char* label);. // enter an interactive Python session (exit with ^D); static void Prompt();; };; LoadMacro(const char* name) - the argument is a name of a Python file that is to be executed ('execfile'), after which any new classes are automatically made available to Cling. Since it is non-selective, use with care.; ExecScript(const char* name,int argc=0,const char** argv=0) - the argument is a name of a python file that is to be executed (‘execfile’) in a private namespace to minimize side-effects.

The school of thought where pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this path.; Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use TLorentzVector instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing, make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may be gained by using psyco, see the next link: http://psyco.sourceforge.net, a Python just in time compiler (JIT). Note, however, that psyco is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since psyco optimizes Python, not PyROOT calls; it generally does not improve performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls. Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot.; Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that member function and an association of this method with 'self'.

The developer must explicitly lock access to objects shared between threads. No other thread can write to a locked object unless it is unlocked. The developer needs to lock local objects. The spirit, if not the letter of this definition, requires the user of the library only to be familiar with the semantic content of the objects in use. Locking access to objects that are being shared due to extra-semantic details of implementation (for example, copy-on-write) should remain the responsibility of the library.; All public and protected functions are reentrant. The library provides protection against multiple threads trying to modify static and global data used within the library. The preferred way of providing this protection is to use mutex locks. The library also locks an object before writing to it. The developer is not required to explicitly lock or unlock a class object (static, global or local) to perform a single operation on the object. Note that even multithread safe level II hardly relieves the user of the library from the burden of locking. A thread suffers from deadlock if it is blocked waiting for a condition that will never occur. Typically, this occurs when one thread needs to access a resource that is already locked by another thread, and that other thread is trying to access a resource that has already been locked by the first thread. In this situation, neither thread is able to progress; they are deadlocked.; A multiprocessor is a hardware system with multiple processors or multiple, simultaneous execution units.

The picture above provides kind of borders to avoid.; 25.6 Layout Management; The layout process is an integral part of any GUI. When you create a simple message window, laying out its few buttons and text widgets is quite simple. However, this process becomes increasingly difficult if you have to implement large GUI’s with many widgets that should behave properly when the GUI is resized or uses a different font type or size. Layout management is the process of determining the size and position of every widget in a container.; A layout manager is an object that performs layout management for the widgets within a container. You already know that when adding a component (child widget) to a container (parent widget) you can provide alignment hints (or rely on the default ones). These hints are used by the layout manager to correctly position the widgets in the container. The TGLayoutManager is an abstract class providing the basic layout functionality. The layout classes hierarchy. The base “container” class is TGCmpositeFrame. You can easily change the layout manager using the SetLayoutManager(TGLayoutManager *l) method. Setting the proper layout manager for each container is the first step you have to do. The container uses that layout manager to position and size the components before they are painted. ROOT currently provides the layout managers shown on the picture above.; The next important step is to provide hints about every widget in the container, i.e. to provide positions and right amount of space between the components.

TGButton is an abstract class defining the general button behavior: width, height, state, its group, tool tip text, etc.; There are two main groups of buttons: command buttons with a text or graphics inside that indicate the action to be accomplished and option buttons well known as radio and check buttons that select or change properties. The first group is presented in ROOT by TGPictureButton and TGTextButton classes. They yield an action as soon as they are clicked. It can be opening/closing a dialog box or invoking a specific function in an application. Remember the Draw button from the example. The radio and check buttons from the second group are used to sel",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

A button that prompts more information for users has the label generally followed by ellipsis (…). As we saw the hot strings “&Draw” and “&Exit” define the text labels “Draw” and “Exit” and keyboard mnemonics Alt+D, Alt+E for their selection. The letter D and E appear underlined on the screen. All text buttons should have a unique shortcut key with the exception of OK and Cancel.; These buttons are usually placed within a window to provide fast access to frequently used or critical commands. They help in situations where a command is not available through the menu bar. You already know that a command string can be passed in the text button via the constructor:; TGTextButton(const TGWindow *p, const char *s, const char *cmd,; Int_t id, GContext_t norm, FontStruct_t font,; UInt_t options);; A button label can be changed by SetText(new_label). There are important guidelines to be followed about a button label. The text has to provide a meaningful description of the performed action. The single-word label should be used whenever possible, only two-three words for clarity, if necessary. Do not number labels. Always follow all platform presentation and usage guidelines for standard button functions. Let’s remember a few standard names and definitions of well known buttons:; OK - any changed information in a window is accepted and the window is closed;; Cancel - closes window without implementing submitted changes;; Reset- resets defaults and cancels any changed information that has not be submitted;; Apply - any changed information is accepted and again displayed in the window that remains open;; Close - closes the window;; Help - opens online Help.; Below are examples of text buttons.

The menu system classes are TGMenuBar, TGMenuTitle, TGPopupMenu, and TGMenuEntry.; The TGMenuBar class implements a menu bar widget. It is used to specify and provide access to common and frequently used application actions described in menu titles, implemented by TGMenuTitle class. The menu bar is the highest-level of the menu system and it is a starting point for all interactions. Also, it is always visible and allows using the keyboard equivalents. The geometry of the menu bar is automatically set to the parent widget, i.e. the menu bar automatically resizes itself so that it has the same width as its parent (typically TGMainFrame).; The menu bar is as a container for its menus - objects of the type TGPopupMenu. Popup menus can appear in a menu bar. They can be a sub-menu of another popup menu (cascading menus) or can be standalone (as a context menu). They are made of one or more menu items choices.

The selected choices should be visible - you have several choices to do this:. to mark selected choices with a check mark or highlight them; to provide a summary list box to the right of the list box, containing the selected choices; to provide a display-only text control indicating the number of selected choices (its position should be justified upper-right above the list box); if the actions Select All or Deselect All must be quickly or frequently performed, use command buttons. 25.8.7 Combo Boxes; A combo box is as single-selection list box that shows only the currently selected entry and a prompt button displayed as a downward arrow. The prompt button provides a visual cue that a list box is hidden. Its main advantage is consuming of quite a bit of screen space. When the user clicks on it, a list pops up, from which a new choice can be made. After a new item is chosen the combo box folds again showing the new selection. The combo box widget is represented by the user callable class TGComboBox. The class TGComboBoxPopup is a service class. The combo box constructor is very similar to the list box one. The first parameter is a parent widget pointer again, the second - an integer value that will be used as combo box ID.

It is a long rectangular bar, initially empty, that fills with a color as a process is being performed. The filled-in area indicates the percentage of the process that has been completed. You should use this widget for waits exceeding one minute. For a very time consuming operation it is better to break the operation into subtasks and provide a progress bar for each of them. A progress bar may be oriented horizontally or vertically. The horizontally oriented progress bar fills with a color from left to right; the vertically oriented - from bottom to top. A percent complete message provides an indication of the completed part of the process. It is a good practice to include some descriptive text of the process to keep users informed and entertained while they are waiting for process completion.; The picture below shows the progress bars you can create using the classes TGProgressBar, TGHProgressBar, and TGHProgressBar.; // vertical frame with three horizontal progressive bars; TGVerticalFrame *vframe = new TGVerticalFrame(fMain, 10, 10)",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The editor complexity can be reduced by splitting it into discrete units of so-called object editors. Any object editor provides an object specific GUI. The main purpose of the ROOT graphics editor is the organization of the object editors’ appearance and the task sequence between them.; 25.9.1 Object Editors; Every object editor follows a simple naming convention: to have as a name the object class name concatenated with ‘Editor’ (e.g. for TGraph objects the object editor is TGraphEditor). Thanks to the signals/slots communication mechanism and to the method DistancetoPrimitive() that computes a ‘‘distance’’ to an object from the mouse position, it was possible to implement a signal method of the canvas that says which is the selected object and to which pad it belongs. Having this information the graphics editor loads the corresponding object editor and the user interface is ready for use. This way after a click on ‘axis’—the axis editor is active; a click on a ‘pad’ activates the pad editor, etc.; The algorithm in use is simple and is based on the object-oriented relationship and communication. When the user activates the editor, according to the selected object <obj> in the canvas it looks for a class name <obj>Editor. For that reason, the correct naming is very important. If a class with this name is found, the editor verifies that this class derives from the base editor class TGedFrame. If all checks are satisfied, the editor makes an instance of the object editor.

Derive the code of your object editor from the base editor class TGedFrame.; Keep the correct naming convention: the name of the object editor should be the object class name concatenated with the word ‘Editor'.; Provide a default constructor.; Use the signals/slots communication mechanism for event processing.; Implement the virtual method SetModel(TObject *obj) where all widgets are set with the current object’s attributes.

When a new object of a different class is selected, the unneeded GED-frames are cached in memory for potential reuse. The frames are deleted automatically when the editor is closed.; Note: A deep cleanup is assumed for all frames put into the editor. This implies:. do not share the layout-hints among GUI components;; do not delete child widgets in the destructor as this is done automatically. 25.9.2.2 Using Several Tabs; Sometimes you might need to use several tabs to organize properly your class-editor. Each editor tab is a resource shared among all the class-editors. Tabs must be created from the constructor of your editor-class by using the method:; TGVerticalFrame* TGedFrame::CreateEditorTabSubFrame(const Text_t *name),; It returns a pointer to a new tab container frame ready for use in your class.

The ROOT implementation uses the ROOT type system. In addition to all features provided by Qt the ROOT version supports connecting slots to a class (as opposed to connecting to a specific object). These slots will be called whenever the specified signal is emitted by any object of the class. Also a slot can have default arguments and be either a class method or a stand-alone function (compiled or interpreted).; 26.2 Basic Concepts; Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.; Signals are emitted by objects when they change their state in a way that may be interesting to the outside world.

One can set HistSize to 0 to disable history line management. There is also implemented an environment variable called ROOT_HIST.

To set Minuit in no graphics mode, call. gMinuit->SetGraphicsMode(kFALSE);; 5.9.1 Basic Concepts of Minuit; The Minuit package acts on a multi parameter FORTRAN function to which one must give the generic name FCN. In the ROOT implementation, the function FCN is defined via the Minuit SetFCN member function when an histogram fitting is invoked. The value of FCN will in general depend on one or more variable parameters.; 5.9.2 The Transformation of Limited Parameters; For variable parameters with limits, Minuit uses the following transformation:; Pint = arcsin(2((Pext-a)/(b-a))-1); Pext = a+((b-a)/(2))(sinPint+1); so that the internal value Pint can take on any value, while the external value Pext can take on values only between the lower limit a and the ext upper limit b. Since the transformation is necessarily non-linear, it would transform a nice linear problem into a nasty non-linear one, which is the reason why limits should be avoided if not necessary. In addition, the transformation does require some computer time, so it slows down the computation a little bit, and more importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into the problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off both become more important as the external value gets closer to one of the limits (expressed as the distance to nearest limit divided by distance between limits). The user must therefore be aware of the fact that, for example, if they put limits of (0, 1010) on a parameter, then the values 0.0 and 1. 0 will be indistinguishable to the accuracy of most machines.; The transformation also affects the parameter error matrix, of course, so Minuit does a transformation of the error matrix (and the ‘’parabolic’’ parameter errors) when there are parameter limits.

This condition, signaled by a Minuit warning message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors unreliable. See the discussion above ‘Getting the right parameter errors with limits’. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors is to use ‘’independent’’ calculations and compare them, or compare the calculated errors with a picture of the function. Theoretically, the covariance matrix for a ‘’physical’’ function must be positive-definite at the minimum, although it may not be so for all points far away from the minimum, even for a well-determined physical problem. Therefore, if MIGRAD reports that it has found a non-positive-definite covariance matrix, this may be a sign of one or more of the following:; 5.9.4.1 A Non-physical Region; On its way to the minimum, MIGRAD may have traversed a region that has unphysical behavior, which is of course not a serious problem as long as it recovers and leaves such a region.; 5.9.4.2 An Underdetermined Problem; If the matrix is not positive-definite even at the minimum, this may mean that the solution is not well defined, for example that there are more unknowns than there are data points, or that the parameterization of the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then Minuit (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely. The error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user must remove the under determinedness by reformulating the parameterization. Minuit cannot do this itself.; 5.9.4.3 Numerical Inaccuracies; It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is due to excessive round off errors in numerical calculations (in the user function), or not enough precision.

Some randomly chosen examples are image analysis, financial movements’ predictions and analysis, or sales forecast and product shipping optimization. In particles physics neural networks are mainly used for classification tasks (signal over background discrimination). A vast majority of commonly used neural networks are multilayer perceptrons. This implementation of multilayer perceptrons is inspired from the MLPfit package, which remains one of the fastest tools for neural networks studies.; 5.12.2 The MLP; The multilayer perceptron is a simple feed-forward network with the following structure showed on the left. It is made of neurons characterized by a bias and weighted links in between - let’s call those links synapses. The input neurons receive the inputs, normalize them and forward them to the first hidden layer. Each neuron in any subsequent layer first computes a linear combination of the outputs of the previous layer. The output of the neuron is then function of that combination with f being linear for output neurons or a sigmoid for hidden layers.; ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

You can pass arguments using .x myScript.C(12, ""A String"").; Alternatively you can load the script and then run a function explicitly:; root [] .L myScript.C; root [] myScript(); The above is equivalent to .x myScript.C.; In a named script, the objects created on the stack are deleted when the function exits. In a common scenario you create a histogram in a named script on the stack. You draw the histogram, but when the function exits the canvas is empty and the histogram has disappeared. To avoid the histogram from disappearing you can create it on the heap (by using new). This will leave the histogram object intact, but the pointer in the named script scope will be “gone”. Since histograms (and trees) are added to the list of objects in the current directory, you can always retrieve them to delete them if needed.; root[] TH1F *h = (TH1F*)gDirectory->Get(""myHist""); // or; root[] TH1F *h = (TH1F*)gDirectory->GetList()->FindObject(""myHist"");; In addition, histograms and trees are automatically deleted when the current directory is closed.

These functions and the dictionary contain the knowledge of the used classes. To do this, rootcling parses all the header files. ROOT has defined some special syntax to inform Cling of certain things, this is done in the comments so that the code still compiles with a C++ compiler.; For example, you have a class with a Draw() method, which will display itself. You would like a context menu to appear when on clicks on the image of an object of this class. The recipe is the following:. The class has to contain the ClassDef/ClassImp macros; For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a comment after the declaration containing *MENU* or *TOGGLE* depending on the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods (setters). The *TOGGLE* comment is used to toggle a boolean data field. In that case, it is safe to call the data field fMyBool where MyBool is the name of the setter SetMyBool. Replace MyBool with your own boolean variable.; You can specify arguments and the data members in which to store the arguments. For example:; class MyClass : public TObject {; private:; int fV1; // first variable; double fV2; // second variable; public:; int GetV1() {return fV1;}; double GetV2() {return fV2;}; void SetV1(int x1) { fV1 = x1;} // *MENU*; void SetV2(double d2) { fV2 = d2;} // *MENU*; void SetBoth(int x1, double d2) {fV1 = x1; fV2 = d2;}.

As you see, TPad defines log scale for the two directions x and y plus z if you want to draw a 3D representation of some function or histogram.; The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:; root[] gPad->SetLogx(1); To reset log in the z direction:; root[] gPad->SetLogz(0); If you have a divided pad, you need to set the scale on each of the sub-pads. Setting it on the containing pad does not automatically propagate to the sub-pads. Here is an example of how to set the log scale for the x-axis on a canvas with four sub-pads:; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas(""MyCanvas"",""My Canvas""); root[] MyCanvas->Divide(2,2); root[] MyCanvas->cd(1); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(2); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(3); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); 9.3.8 WaitPrimitive method; When the TPad::WaitPrimitive() method is called with no arguments, it will wait until a double click or any key pressed is executed in the canvas. A call to gSystem->Sleep(10) has been added in the loop to avoid consuming at all the CPU. This new option is convenient when executing a macro. By adding statements like:; canvas->WaitPrimitive();; You can monitor the progress of a running macro, stop it at convenient places with the possibility to interact with the canvas and resume the execution with a double click or a key press.; 9.3.9 Locking the Pad; You can make the TPad non-editable. Then no new objects can be added, and the existing objects and the pad can not be changed with the mouse or programmatically. By default the TPad is editable.; TPad::SetEditable(kFALSE); 9.4 Graphical Objects; In this paragraph, we describe the various simple 2D graphical objects defined in ROOT.

It is defined by a set of N points in a 2D space. Its constructor is:; TPolyLine(Int_t n,Double_t* x,Double_t* y,Option_t* option); Where n is the number of points, and x and y are arrays of n elements with the coordinates of the points. TPolyLine can be used by it self, but is also a base class for other objects, such as curly arcs.; 9.4.2 Circles and Ellipses; An ellipse can be truncated and rotated. It is defined by its center (x1,y1) and two radii r1 and r2. A minimum and maximum angle may be specified (phimin,phimax). The ellipse may be rotated with an angle theta. All these angles are in degrees. The attributes of the outline line are set via TAttLine, of the fill area - via TAttFill class. They are described in “Graphical Objects Attributes”. Different types of ellipses. When an ellipse sector is drawn only, the lines between the center and the end points of the sector are drawn by default. By specifying the drawn option “only”, these lines can be avoided. Alternatively, the method SetNoEdges() can be called. To remove completely the ellipse outline, specify zero (0) as a line style.; The TEllipse constructor is:; TEllipse(Double_t x1, Double_t y1, Double_t r1, Double_t r2,; Double_t phimin, Double_t phimax, Double_t theta); An ellipse may be created with:; root[] e = new TEllipse(0.2,0.2,0.8,0.3); root[] e->Draw(); 9.4.3 Rectangles; The class TBox defines a rectangle. It is a base class for many different higher-level graphical primitives. Its bottom left coordinates x1, y1 and its top right coordinates x2, y2, defines a box. The constructor is:; TBox(Double_t x1,Double_t y1,Double_t x2,Double_t y2); It may be used as in:; root[] b = new TBox(0.2,0.2,0.8,0.3); root[] b->SetFillColor(5); root[] b->Draw().

Particularly if pages are being generated in some loop, one needs to detect the special cases of first and last page. The “[” and “]” can be used instead of “(” and “)” as shown in the next example.; c1.Print(""file.ps[""); // no actual print; just open file.ps; for (i=0; i<10; ++i) {; // fill canvas for context i; ...; c1.Print(""file.ps""); // actually print canvas to file.ps; } // end loop; c1.Print(""file.ps]""); // no actual print; just close file.ps; The following script illustrates how to open a postscript file and draw several pictures.

Splitting avoids having to do the expensive tessellation on the first pass. 9.13.4.4 Shape Specific TBuffer3D Derived Classes; Currently we provide the following shape specific classes, which the GL Viewer can take advantage of (see TBuffer3D.h and TBuffer3DTypes.h). TBuffer3DSphere - solid, hollow and cut spheres (GL Viewer only supports solid spheres at present - cut / hollow ones will be requested as tessellated objects by client.); TBuffer3DTube - basic tube with inner/outer radius and length.; TBuffer3DTubeSeg - angle tube segment.; TBuffer3DCutTube - angle tube segment with plane cut ends. See the above example from TGeoSphere::GetBuffer3D and also equivalent functions in TGeoTube, TGeoTubeSeg and TGeoCtub. Anyone is free to add new TBuffer3D classes, but it should be clear that one or more viewers will require updating to be able to take advantage of them. Hence we only provide classes which existing viewers can benefit from.

Scene rebuilds will require destruction and recreation of all physical objects. For the second you can specify an identifier from the client side, which must be unique and stable - i.e. the IDs of a published object is consistent, regardless of changes in termination of contained child geometry branches. In this case the viewer can safely cache the physical objects across scene rebuilds, discarding those no longer of interest.; 9.13.4.10 Child Objects; In many geometries there is a rigid containment hierarchy, and so if the viewer is not interested in a certain object due to limits/size then it will also not be interest in any of the contained branch of siblings.

This chapter covers the saving and reading of objects to and from ROOT files. It begins with an explanation of the physical layout of a ROOT file. It includes a discussion on compression, and file recovery. Then we explain the logical file, the class TFile and its methods. We show how to navigate in a file, how to save objects and read them back. We also include a discussion on Streamers. Streamers are the methods responsible to capture an objects current state to save it to disk or send it over the network. At the end of the chapter is a discussion on the two specialized ROOT files: TNetFile and TWebFile.; 11.1 The Physical Layout of ROOT Files; A ROOT file is like a UNIX file directory. It can contain directories and objects organized in unlimited number of levels. It also is stored in machine independent format (ASCII, IEEE floating point, Big Endian byte ordering). To look at the physical layout of a ROOT file, we first create one.

Later in this section is an example that compares disk space, memory usage, and I/O times of C++ pointers and TRefs. In general, a TRef is faster than C++ but the advantage of a C++ pointer is that it is already C++.; 11.4.1 Streaming C++ Pointers; When ROOT encounters a pointer data member it calls the Streamer of the object and labels it with a unique object identifier. The object identifier is unique for one I/O operation. If there is another pointer to the object in the same I/O operation, the first object is referenced i.e. it is not saved again. When reading the file, the object is rebuilt and the references recalculated. Streaming object pointers. In this way, the network of pointers and their objects is rebuilt and ready to use the same way it was used before it was persistent. If the pointer hold the address of an object which in embedded in another object (as opposed to being pointed to by a pointer), the object will be duplicate at read time. To avoid this, make the pointer a transient data member.; 11.4.2 Motivation for the TRef Class; If the object is split into several files or into several branches of one or more TTrees, standard C++ pointers cannot be used because each I/O operation will write the referenced objects, and multiple copies will exist. In addition, if the pointer is read before the referenced object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address these limitations, ROOT offers the TRef class.; TRef allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in a different file. TRef also supports the complex situation where a TFile is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different machine. When a TRef is read before its referenced object, it is null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the TRef points to it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by TRef in the case it is read before its reference object (see“Action on Demand” below).; 11.4.3 Using TRef; A TRef is a lightweight object pointing",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Each TProcessID has a table (TObjArray *fObjects) that keeps track of all referenced objects. If a referenced object has a fUniqueID, a pointer to this unique object may be found using fObjects->At(fUniqueID). In the same way, when a TRef::GetObject is called, GetObject uses its own fUniqueID to find the pointer to the referenced object. See TProcessID::GetObjectWithID and PutObjectWithID.; 11.4.4.2 Object Number; When an object is referenced, a unique identifier is computed and stored in both the fUniqueID of the referenced and referencing object. This uniqueID is computed by incrementing by one the static global in TProcessID::fgNumber. The fUniqueID is the serial object number in the current session. One can retrieve the current fgNumber value by calling the static function TProcessID::GetObjectCount at any time or can set this number by TProcessID::SetObjectCount. To avoid a growing table of fObjects in TProcessID, in case, for example, one processes many events in a loop, it might be necessary to reset the object number at the end of processing of one event. See an example in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx (look at function Build). The value of ObjectNumbermay be saved at the beginning of one event and reset to this original value at the end of the event. These actions may be nested.; saveNumber = TProcessID::GetObjectCount();; ...; TProcessID::SetObjectCount(savedNumber);; 11.4.5 Action on Demand; The normal behavior of a TRef has been described above. In addition, TRef supports “Actions on Demand”. It may happen that the referenced object is not yet in the memory, on a separate file or not yet computed. In this case, TRef is able to execute automatically an action:. Call to a compiled function (static function of member function); Call to an interpreted function; Execution of a Cling script. 11.4.5.1 How to Select This Option?; In the definition of the TRef data member in the original class, do:; TRef fRef; //EXEC:execName points to something; Wh",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This branch (TBranchRef) will keep all the information needed to find the branches containing referenced objects at each Tree::Fill, the branch numbers containing the referenced objects are saved in the table of references. When the Tree header is saved (via TTree::Write for example), the branch is saved, keeping the information with the pointers to the branches having referenced objects. Enabling this optional table, allow TTree::Draw to automatically load the branches needed to dereference a TRef (or TRefArray) object.; 12.7.3 Autosave; Autosave gives the option to save all branch buffers every n byte. We recommend using Autosave for large acquisitions. If the acquisition fails to complete, you can recover the file and all the contents since the last Autosave.

Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification. Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains).

Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification. Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains).

The TTree::Process method is used to specify the selector and the entries. Before we can use TTree::Process we need to make a selector. We can call the TTree::MakeSelector method. It creates two files similar to TTree::MakeClass.; In the resulting files is a class that is a descendent of TSelector and implements the following methods:. TSelector::Begin() - this method is called every time a loop over the tree starts. This is a convenient place to create your histograms.; TSelector::Notify() - it is called at the first entry of a new tree in a chain.; TSelector::Process() - it is called to process an event. It is the user’s responsibility to read the corresponding entry in memory (may be just a partial read). Once the entry is in memory one can apply a selection and if the event is selected histograms can be filled. Processing stops when this function returns kFALSE. It combines the methods TSelector::ProcessCut() and TSelector::ProcessFill() in one, avoiding the necessity to maintain the state in the class to communicate between these two functions. It reduces the information that needs to be shared between them and promotes a more granular data access by reading branches as they are needed.; TSelector::Terminate() - it is called at the end of a loop on a TTree. This is a convenient place to draw and fit your histograms.; TSelector::Version() - this function provides backward compatibility for old versions and support for the future upgrades.; The TSelector, unlike the resulting class from MakeClass, separates the processing into a ProcessCut() and ProcessFill(), so we can limit reading of branches to the ones we need.; When a selector is used with a TChain in methods Process(), ProcessFill(), ProcessCut(), you must use the pointer to the current TTree to call the method GetEntry(entry).

Higher the level, better random properties are obtained at a price of longer CPU time for generating a random number. The level 3 is the default, where any theoretical possible correlation has very small chance of being detected. This generator uses a state of 24 32-bits words.

If one would like to monitor the tolerance parameter but not have the code stop in case of a number smaller than fTol, one could proceed as follows:; TVectorD b = ..;; TMatrixD a = ..;; .; TDecompLU lu(a);; Bool_t ok;; TVectorD x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; Int_t nr = 0;; while (!ok) {; lu.SetMatrix(a);; lu.SetTol(0.1*lu.GetTol());; if (nr++ > 10) break;; x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; }; if (x.IsValid()); cout << ""solved with tol ="" << lu.GetTol() << endl;; else; cout << ""solving failed "" << endl;; The observant reader will notice that by scaling the complete matrix by some small number the decomposition will detect a singular matrix. In this case, the user will have to reduce the tolerance number by this factor. (For CPU time saving we decided not to make this an automatic procedure).; 14.6.2 Condition number; The numerical accuracy of the solution x in Ax = b can be accurately estimated by calculating the condition number k of matrix \(A\), which is defined as:; \(k = ||A||_{1}||A^{-1}||_{1}\) where \(||A||_{1} = \underset{j}{max}(\sum_{i}|A_{ij}|)\); A good rule of thumb is that if the matrix condition number is 10n, the accuracy in x is 15 - n digits for double precision.; Hager devised an iterative method (W.W.

In the end, the compiler leaves it the user to ensure that the types are correct. This only leaves the other alternative: creating a new class each time a new (container organization) / (contained object) combination is needed. To say the least this could be very tedious. Most people faced with this choice would, for each type of container:; Define the class leaving a dummy name for the contained object type. When a particular container was needed, copy the code and then do a global search and replace for the contained class. C++ has a built in template scheme that effectively does just this. For example:; template<class T>; class ArrayContainer {; private:; T *member[10];; ...; };; This is an array container with a 10-element array of pointers to T, it could hold up to 10 T objects. This array is flawed because it is static and hard-coded, it should be dynamic.

This array is flawed because it is static and hard-coded, it should be dynamic. However, the important point is that the template statement indicates that T is a template, or parameterized class. If we need an ArrayContainer for Track objects, it can be created by:; ArrayContainer<Track> MyTrackArrayContainer;; C++ takes the parameter list and substitutes Track for T throughout the definition of the class ArrayContainer, then compiles the code so generated, effectively doing the same we could do by hand, but with a lot less effort.; This produces code that is type safe, but does have different drawbacks:. Templates make code harder to read.; At the time of writing this documentation, some compilers can be very slow when dealing with templates.; It does not solve the problem when a container has to hold a heterogeneous set of objects.; The system can end up generating a great deal of code; each container/object combination has its own code, a phenomenon that is sometimes referred to as code bloat.; The Standard Template Library (STL) is part on ANSI C++, and includes a set of template containers. 17 Physics Vectors; The physics vector classes describe vectors in three and four dimensions and their rotation algorithms.

The new ROOT geometry package is a tool for building, browsing, navigating and visualizing detector geometries. The code works standalone with respect to any tracking Monte-Carlo engine; therefore, it does not contain any constraints related to physics. However, the navigation features provided by the package are designed to optimize particle transport through complex geometries, working in correlation with simulation packages such as GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA.; 18.1 Quick Start: Creating the “world”; This chapter will provide a detailed description on how to build valid geometries as well as the ways to optimize them. There are several components gluing together the geometrical model, but for the time being let us get used with the most basic concepts.; The basic bricks for building-up the model are called volumes.These represent the un-positioned pieces of the geometry puzzle. The difference is just that the relationship between the pieces is not defined by neighbors, but by containment.

Looking at our simple world example, one can see that for creating volumes one needs to create tracking media before.

They provide the definition of the local coordinate system of the volume. Any volume must have a shape. Any shape recognized by the modeller has to derive from the base TGeoShape class, providing methods for:. Finding out if a point defined in their local frame is contained or not by the shape;; Computing the distance to enter/exit the shape from a local point, given a known direction;; Computing the maximum distance in any direction from a local point that does NOT result in a boundary crossing of the shape (safe distance);; Computing the cosines of the normal vector to the crossed shape surface, given a starting local point and an ongoing direction. All the features above are globally managed by the modeller in order to provide navigation functionality. In addition to those, shapes have also to implement additional specific abstract methods:. Computation of the minimal box bounding the shape, given that this box have to be aligned with the local coordinates;; Algorithms for dividing the shape along a given axis. The modeller currently provides a set of 20 basic shapes, which we will call primitives. It also provides a special class allowing the creation of shapes as a result of Boolean operations between primitives. These are called composite shapes and the composition operation can be recursive (combined composites).

The modeller allows however the definition of a single volume having undefined shape parameters.; TGeoManager::Volume(const char *name,const char *shape,Int_t nmed);. name: the name of the newly created volume;; shape:the type of the associated shape. This has to contain the case-insensitive first 4 letters of the corresponding class name (e.g. “tubs” will match TGeoTubeSeg, “bbox” will match TGeoBBox); nmed: the medium number. This will create a special volume that will not be directly used in the geometry, but whenever positioned will require a list of actual parameters for the current shape that will be created in this process. Such volumes having shape parameters known only when used have to be positioned only with TGeoManager::Node() method (see ‘Creating and Positioning Volumes’).; Other case when shape parameterizations are quite useful is scaling geometry structures. Imagine that we would like to enlarge/shrink a detector structure on one or more axes. This happens quite often in real life and is handled by “fitting mother” parameters. This is accomplished by defining shapes with one or more invalid (negative) parameters. For instance, defining a box having dx=10., dy=10., and dz=-1 will not generate an error but will be interpreted in a different way: A special volume TGeoVolumeMulti will be created. Whenever positioned inside a mother volume, this will create a normal TGeoVolume object having as shape a box with dz fitting the corresponding dzof the mother shape. Generally, this type of parameterization is used when positioning volumes in containers having a matching shape, but it works also for most reasonable combinations.; 18.4 Geometry Creation; A given geometry can be built in various ways, but one has to follow some mandatory steps. Even if we might use some terms that will be explained later, here are few general rules:.

When undefined by users, painting a node on a pad will take the corresponding volume attributes.; 18.4.2 Creating and Positioning Volumes; 18.4.2.1 Making Volumes; As mentioned before, volumes are the basic objects used in building the geometrical hierarchy. They represent objects that are not positioned, but store all information about the placement of the other volumes they may contain. Therefore a volume can be replicated several times in the geometry. As it was explained, in order to create a volume, one has to put together a shape and a medium, which are already defined.; Volumes have to be named by users at creation time. Every different name may represent a unique volume object, but may also represent more general a family (class) of volume objects having the same shape type and medium, but possibly different shape parameters. It is the user’s task to provide different names for different volume families in order to avoid ambiguities at tracking time.; A generic family rather than a single volume is created only in two cases: when a parametric shape is used or when a division operation is applied. Each volume in the geometry stores a unique ID corresponding to its family. In order to ease-up their creation, the manager class is providing an API that allows making a shape and a volume in a single step.; 18.4.2.2 Example of Volume Creation; // Making a volume out of a shape and a medium.; TGeoVolume *vol = new TGeoVolume(""VNAME"",ptrShape,ptrMed);. // Making a volume out of a shape but without a defined medium.; TGeoVolume *vol = new TGeoVolume(""VNAME"",ptrShape);. // Making a volume with a given shape in one step; TGeoVolume *vol = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""VNAME"",ptrMed,dx,dy,dz);; TGeoVolume *vol = gGeoManager->MakeTubs(""VNAME"",ptrMed,rmin,rmax,; dz,phi1,phi2);. // See class TGeoManager for the rest of shapes.; // Making a volume with a given shape with a unique prototype; T",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This is more or less the case for detector geometries of complex experiments, where a ‘flat’ CSG model description cannot scale with the current CPU performances. This is the reason why models like GEANT [1] introduced an additional dimension (depth) in order to reduce the complexity of the problem. This concept is also preserved by the ROOT modeller and introduces a pure geometrical constraint between objects (volumes in our case) - containment. This means in fact that any positioned volume has to be contained by another. Now what means contained and positioned?. We will say that a volume contains a point if this is inside the shape associated to the volume. For instance, a volume having a box shape will contain all points P=(X,Y,Z) verifying the conditions: Abs(Pi)dXi. The points on the shape boundaries are considered as inside the volume. The volume contains a daughter if it contains all the points contained by the daughter.; The definition of containment works of course only with points defined in the local coordinate system of the considered volume.

In other words, the limitation in proceeding this way is that D,E, and F must point to the same medium. If this was not the case, we would have to define different virtual volumes for each placement: C, C' and C"", having the same shape but different media matching the corresponding containers. This might not happen so often, but when it does, it forces the creation of several extra virtual volumes. Other limitation comes from the fact that any container is directly used by navigation algorithms to optimize tracking. These must geometrically contain their belongings (positioned volumes) so that these do not extrude its shape boundaries. Not respecting this rule generally leads to unpredictable results. Therefore A and B together must fit into C that has to fit also into D,E, and F. This is not always straightforward to accomplish, especially when instead of A and B we have many more volumes.; In order to avoid these problems, one can use for the difficult cases the class TGeoVolumeAssembly, representing an assembly of volumes. This behaves like a normal container volume supporting other volumes positioned inside, but it has neither shape nor medium. It cannot be used directly as a piece of the geometry, but just as a temporary structure helping temporary assembling and positioning volumes.; If we define now C as an assembly containing A and B, positioning the assembly into D,E and F will actually position only A and Bdirectly into these volumes, taking into account their combined transformations A/B to C and C to D/E/F. This looks much nicer, is it? In fact, it is and it is not. Of course, we managed to get rid of the ‘unnecessary’ volume C in our geometry, but we end-up with a more flat structure for D,E and F (more daughters inside). This can get much worse when extensively used, as in the case: assemblies of assemblies.; For deciding what to choose between using virtual containers or assemblies for a specific case, one can use for both ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The answer provided by the modeller to “Where am I?” is no longer deterministic if there is no priority assigned.; There are two ways out provided by the modeller in such cases and we will illustrate them by examples. Suppose we have 2 crossing tubes that we have to describe. Such a structure cannot be decomposed in a containment schema. This is a typical example of simple structure that can be handled by using composite shapes. What we have to do is to define as shapes the inner and outer parts of the tubes (tubes having Rmin=0,Rmax=inner/outer radius), then to make a composite:; C = (Tub1out+Tub2out)-(Tub1in+Tub2in); On the other hand, if we have an EM calorimeter having a honeycomb structure, Boolean combinations do not help anymore. Here the problem is that we usually have a very large number of cells that are naturally belonging to the same container. This result in a very flat and slow structure for that particular container, which we would very much want to avoid by introducing additional levels in depth. We can describe the basic cell as a hexahedron that we can represent by using a polygon primitive shape. Instead of putting one by one all cells in the same container, we can define rows of such elements, fitting in box-shaped containers. Then we can put row-beside-row inside the container, making life much easier for its navigation algorithms. The problem is that in order to reproduce the honeycomb structure out of rows of cells, we have to overlap row containers. Whoops - we have not obeyed rule No. 2 in positioning. The way out is to position our rows with a special prototype:. ptrCAL->AddNodeOverlap(""ROW"",nRow,matrixRow);; This will instruct the modeller that the daughter ROW inside CAL overlaps with something else. The modeller will check this at closure time and build a list of possibly overlapping candidates. This option is equivalent with the option MANY in GEANT3.; The modeller supports such cases ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

We will designate non-overlapping nodes as ONLY and the others MANY as in GEANT3, where this concept was introduced:. The part of a MANY node B extruding its container A will never be “seen” during navigation, as if B was in fact the result of the intersection of A and B.; If we have two nodes A (ONLY) and B (MANY) inside the same container, all points in the overlapping region of A and B will be designated as belonging to A.; If A an B in the above case were both MANY, points in the overlapping part will be designated to the one defined first. Both nodes must have the same medium.; The slices of a divided MANY will be as well MANY. One needs to know that navigation inside geometry parts MANY nodes is much slower. Any overlapping part can be defined based on composite shapes - might be in some cases a better way out.; 18.4.2.7 Replicating Volumes; What can we do if our chamber contains two identical wires instead of one? What if then we would need 1000 chambers in our detector? Should we create 2000 wires and 1000 chamber volumes? No, we will just need to replicate the ones that we have already created.; chamber->AddNode(wire_co,1,new TGeoTranslation(0.2,0,0));; chamber->AddNode(wire_co,2,new TGeoTranslation(0.2,0,0));; The 2 nodes that we have created inside chamber will both point to a wire_co object, but will be completely distinct: WIRE_CO_1 and WIRE_CO_2. We will want now to place symmetrically 1000 chambers on a pad, following a pattern of 20 rows and 50 columns. One way to do this will be to replicate our chamber by positioning it 1000 times in different positions of the pad. Unfortunately, this is far from being the optimal way of doing what we want. Imagine that we would like to find out which of the 1000 chambers is containing a (x,y,z) point defined in the pad reference.

The owner of such regions cannot be determined based on hierarchical considerations; therefore they will be considered as belonging to the node from which the current track is coming from. When coming from their container, the ownership is totally unpredictable. Again, the ownership of overlapping regions highly depends on the current track parameters.; We must say that even the overlaps of type A) and B) are allowed in case the corresponding nodes are created using TGeoVolume::AddNodeOverlap() method. Navigation is performed in such cases by giving priority to the non-overlapping nodes. The modeller has to perform an additional search through the overlapping candidates. These are detected automatically during the geometry closing procedure in order to optimize the algorithm, but we will stress that extensive usage of this feature leads to a drastic deterioration of performance. In the following we will focus on the non-declared overlaps of type A) and B) since this is the main source of errors during tracking. These are generally non-intended overlaps due to coding mistakes or bad geometry design. The checking package is loaded together with the painter classes and contains an automated overlap checker.**.

The Align() method will actually duplicate the corresponding branch within the logical hierarchy, creating new volumes and nodes. This is mandatory in order to avoid problems due to replicated volumes and can create exhaustive memory consumption if used abusively.; Once aligned, a physical node is ready to be tracked. The operation can be done only after the geometry was closed.; Important NOTE: Calling the Align() method for a physical node changes the node pointers for the stored node branch in the active geometry, Due to this the other defined physical nodes containing elements of this path will be invalid. Example:; TGeoPhysicalNode *pn1 =; gGeoManager->MakePhysicalNode(""/A_1/B_1/C_2"");; TGeoPhysicalNode *pn2 =; gGeoManager->MakePhysicalNode(""/A_1/B_1/C_3"");; ...; pn1->Align(...);; The call to pn1->Align() will invalidate the pointer to the node B_1 in pn2 object.. The way out is to either call pn1->Align() before the creation of pn2, either to use a global method that will correct all existing physical nodes:; void RefreshPhysicalNodes(Bool_t lock = kTRUE); The method above will optionally lock the possibility of doing any further misalignment.; 18.9 Geometry I/O; Once geom",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

MyOtherCondition.Signal() has no effect.; If several threads wait for the signal from the same TCondition MyCondition, at MyCondition.Signal() only one thread will react; to activate a further thread another MyCondition.Signal() is required, etc.; If several threads wait for the signal from the same TCondition MyCondition, at MyCondition.Broadcast() all threads waiting for MyCondition are activated at once. In some tests of MyCondition using an internal mutex, Broadcast() activated only one thread (probably depending whether MyCondition had been signaled before). MyCondition.TimedWait(secs,nanosecs) waits for MyCondition until the absolute time in seconds and nanoseconds since beginning of the epoch (January, 1st, 1970) is reached; to use relative timeouts ‘‘delta’‘, it is required to calculate the absolute time at the beginning of waiting ‘‘now’’; for example:.

Note that even multithread safe level II hardly relieves the user of the library from the burden of locking. A thread suffers from deadlock if it is blocked waiting for a condition that will never occur. Typically, this occurs when one thread needs to access a resource that is already locked by another thread, and that other thread is trying to access a resource that has already been locked by the first thread. In this situation, neither thread is able to progress; they are deadlocked.; A multiprocessor is a hardware system with multiple processors or multiple, simultaneous execution units.

It is a composite frame with a border and a title. The title explains the purpose of the group and should be a noun or noun phrase. Here is an example taken from guitest.C:; groupFrame = new TGGroupFrame(tf,""Options"",kVerticalFrame);; groupFrame->SetTitlePos(TGGroupFrame::kLeft);; The second line sets the title position on the left. You can change it to be centered or right aligned if you use TGGroupFrame::kCenter or TGGroupFrame::kRight as a parameter. Be conservative in the use of borders because of the potential for clutter. Do not place them around single entry fields, single combo boxes, list boxes and groups of command buttons. The design of these widgets provides them with a border. The picture above provides kind of borders to avoid.; 25.6 Layout Management; The layout process is an integral part of any GUI. When you create a simple message window, laying out its few buttons and text widgets is quite simple. However, this process becomes increasingly difficult if you have to implement large GUI’s with many widgets that should behave properly when the GUI is resized or uses a different font type or size. Layout management is the process of determining the size and position of every widget in a container.; A layout manager is an object that performs layout management for the widgets within a container. You already know that when adding a component (child widget) to a container (parent widget) you can provide alignment hints (or rely on the default ones). These hints are used by the layout manager to correctly position the widgets in the container. The TGLayoutManager is an abstract class providing the basic layout functionality.

There are two general ways for the user to interact with an application: the keyboard and the mouse. The Graphical User Interface is as a bridge between the user and the program - it provides methods to detect the user actions and instruments that do something as a reaction of these actions. The user communicates with an application through the window system. The window system reports interaction events to the application. The application in turn forwards them to the currently active window. The objects/widgets receive the events and react to them according to the application functionality. The signals/slot communication mechanism is an advanced object communication concept; it largely replaces the concept of callback functions to handle actions in GUI’s. Signals and slots are just like any object-oriented methods implemented in C++. The objects are the instances of classes that don’t know anything about each other. They interact and allow method calls of other object’s methods. The idea is simple: any object can send out (emit) a signal in certain situations saying that something happened. This is all it does to communicate and it does not know whether anything is interested i",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The first parameter is the window to which the button messages will be sent. Lastly, we create an object of class TGHorizontal3DLine - a horizontal 3D line. It will separate the toolbar from the menu bar because the layout hints we define as kLHintsTop | kLHintsExpandX.; It is user friendly to allow the possibility for the tool bar to be turned on or off (via a menu). If you use a single tool bar, it should fill the complete width of its parent. When using more than one, you should also think about setting the bar size to the end of the most right button. This way other bars can be displayed in the same row below the menu bar.; Tool bar buttons should have equal size, meaningful and unique icons, and short meaningful tool tip text. The related buttons should be grouped together by frequency or sequence of use, or importance. Potentially destructive buttons must be separated from them to avoid accidental activation and potentially catastrophic results. Temporarily not available items should be displayed grayed out.; 25.8.6 List Boxes; The purpose of a list box is to display a collection of items from which single or multiple selection can be made. It is always visible, having a scroll bar when the displayed area is not enough to show all items. The choices may be mutually exclusive (a list box with single selection) or not mutually exclusive (a list box with multiple selection). The proper usage of the list boxes is for selecting values, or objects, or setting attributes. You have to create them to display 4 to 8 choices at one time (3 is a required minimum in case of lack of screen space). The list should contain not more than 40 items accessible by scrolling view (vertical scroll bar). If more are required, you should provide a method for using search criteria or scoping the options. The best list boxes use is for textual data or choices.

Raymond. It means a liberal, informal development style that heavily relies on the diverse and deep talent of the user community. The result is that physicists developed ROOT for themselves; this made it specific, appropriate, useful, and over time refined and very powerful. The development of ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming co-developers.; When it comes to storing and mining large amount of data, physics plows the way with its Terabytes, but other fields and industry follow close behind as they acquiring more and more data over time.

The libraries are designed and organized to minimize dependencies, such that you can load just enough code for the task at hand rather than having to load all libraries or one monolithic chunk. The core library (libCore.so) contains the essentials; it is a part of all ROOT applications. In the Figure 1-2 you see that libCore.so is made up of base classes, container classes, meta information classes, operating system specific classes, and the ZIP algorithm used for compression of the ROOT files.; The Cling library (libCling.so) is also needed in all ROOT applications, and even by libCore. A program referencing only TObject only needs libCore; libCling will be opened automatically. To add the ability to read and write ROOT objects one also has to load libRIO. As one would expect, none of that depends on graphics or the GUI.; Library dependencies have different consequences; depending on whether you try to build a binary, or you just try to access a class that is defined in a library.; 1.6.2.2 Linktime Library Dependencies; When building your own executable you will have to link against the libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by root-config -glibs; the graphics libraries are retuned by root-config --libs. These commands are commonly used in Makefiles. Using root-config instead of enumerating the libraries by hand allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT library names change you will not need to change your Makefile.; A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates, fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core libraries (libCore, libRIO), libHist and libTree.

Try to draw the function sin(x)/x again. Every object in a window (which is called a canvas) is, in fact, a graphical object in the sense that you can grab it, resize it, and change its characteristics with a mouse click. For example, bring the cursor over the x-axis. The cursor changes to a hand with a pointing finger when it is over the axis. Now, left click and drag the mouse along the axis to the right. You have a very simple zoom.; When you move the mouse over any object, you can get access to selected methods by pressing the right mouse button and obtaining a context menu. If you try this on the function TF1, you will get a menu showing available methods. The other objects on this canvas are the title, a TPaveText object; the x and y-axis, TAxis objects, the frame, a TFrame object, and the canvas a TCanvas object. Try clicking on these and observe the context menu with their methods. A context menu. For example try selecting the SetRange() method and putting -10, 10 in the dialog box fields. This is equivalent to executing f1.SetRange(-10,10) from the command line, followed by f1.Draw(). Here are some other options you can try.; Once the picture suits your wishes, you may want to see the code you should put in a script to obtain the same result. To do that, choose Save / canvas.C entry of the File menu. This will generate a script showing the options set in the current canvas.

The rootalias.C file is loaded but not executed. It typically contains small utility functions. For example, the rootalias.C script that comes with the ROOT distributions (located in $ROOTSYS/tutorials) defines the function edit(char *file). This allows the user to call the editor from the command line. This particular function will start the VI editor if the environment variable EDITOR is not set.; root[0] edit(""c1.C""); For more details, see $ROOTSYS/tutorials/rootalias.C.; 2.7.2 History File; You can use the up and down arrow at the command line, to access the previous and next command. The commands are recorded in the history file $HOME/.root_hist. It is a text file, and you can edit, cut, and paste from it. You can specify the history file in the system.rootrc file, by setting the Rint.Historyoption. You can also turn off the command logging in the system.rootrc file with the option: Rint.History: -; The number of history lines to be kept can be set also in .rootrc by:; Rint.HistSize: 500; Rint.HistSave: 400; The first value defines the maximum of lines kept; once it is reached all, the last HistSave lines will be removed.

A call to TH1::Fit adds the fitted function to this list. Given a histogram h, one can retrieve the associated function with:; TF1 *myfunc = h->GetFunction(""myfunc"");; 5.5.2 Access to the Fit Parameters and Results; If the histogram (or graph) is made persistent, the list of associated functions is also persistent. Retrieve a pointer to the function with the TH1::GetFunction() method. Then you can retrieve the fit parameters from the function (TF1) with calls such as:; root[] TF1 *fit = hist->GetFunction(function_name);; root[] Double_t chi2 = fit->GetChisquare();; // value of the first parameter; root[] Double_t p1 = fit->GetParameter(0);; // error of the first parameter; root[] Double_t e1 = fit->GetParError(0);; Using the fit option S one can access the full result of the fit including the covariance and correlation matrix.

In addition TFitResult derives from TNamed and can be conveniently stored in a file.; When fitting an histogram ( a TH1 object) or a graph (a TGraph object) it is possible to return a TFitResult via the TFitResultPtr object, which behaves as a smart pointer to a TFitResult. TFitResultPtr is the return object by TH1::Fit or TGraph::Fit. By default the TFitResultPtr contains only the status of the fit and can be obtained by an automatic conversion of the TFitResultPtr to an integer.; If the fit option S is instead used, TFitResultPtr contains the TFitResult and behaves as a smart pointer to it. This is an example:; int fitStatus = hist->Fit(myFunction); // TFitResultPtr contains only the fit status. TFitResultPtr r = hist->Fit(myFunction,""S""); // TFitResultPtr contains the TFitResult; TMatrixDSym cov = r->GetCovarianceMatrix(); // to access the covariance matrix; Double_t chi2 = r->Chi2(); // to retrieve the fit chi2; Double_t par0 = r->Parameter(0); // retrieve the value for the parameter 0; Double_t err0 = r->ParError(0); // retrieve the error for the parameter 0; r->Print(""V""); // print full information of fit including covariance matrix; r->Write(); // store the result in a file; 5.8 The Minimization packages; As explained before various minimization packages can be used when fitting in ROOT. We have seen before how to configure the Fitter class to use different minimization packages and different minimization options. When using the Fit method the minimization package (and its options) can be selected using the static methods of the ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions class. For example to select Minuit2 instead of Minuit for fitting an histogram do:; ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""Minuit2"");; // fit the histogram histo with the gaussian pre-defined function; histo->Fit(""gaus"");; In the following we will give some brief description of the minimization packages.

For example, in the case of TArrow, the base class TLine is declared as public:; class TArrow : public TLine { ...; This means that all methods of TArrow will be able to access all methods of TLine, but this will be also true for anybody in the outside world.

Even the classes that we could derive from TArrow will not see it. On the other hand, if we declare the method Draw() as public, everybody will be able to see it and use it. You see that the character public or private does not depend of the type of argument. It can be a data member, a member function, or even a class. For example, in the case of TArrow, the base class TLine is declared as public:; class TArrow : public TLine { ...; This means that all methods of TArrow will be able to access all methods of TLine, but this will be also true for anybody in the outside world. Of course, this is true if TLine accepts the outside world to see its methods/data members.

See Resetting the Interpreter Environment in the chapter “Cling the C++ Interpreter”.; 7 The C++ Interpreter Cling. ROOT has a C++ interpreter called cling built in. It is used for the prompt, both C++ and Python. It also serves as a source of information to store C++ objects, and provides the back-end for ROOT’s signal/slot and plug-in mechanisms.; This chapter focuses on the parts of cling that you will encounter while interacting with ROOT.; 7.1 The ROOT Prompt; Start up a ROOT session by typing root at the system prompt.; $ root; -------------------------------------------------------------------------; | Welcome to ROOT 6.10/01 http://root.cern.ch |; | (c) 1995-2017, The ROOT Team |; | Built for macosx64 |; | From heads/v6-10-",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This will automatically take care of the clean up. See “Input/Output”.; 7.2.1 Executing a Script From a Script; You may want to execute a script conditionally inside another script. To do it you need to call the interpreter and you can do that with TROOT::ProcessLine(). The example $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/cernstaff.C calls a script to build the root file if it does not exist:; void cernstaff() {; if (gSystem->AccessPathName(""cernstaff.root"")) {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".x cernbuild.C"");; }; ProcessLine takes a parameter, which is a pointer to an int or to a TInterpreter::EErrorCode to let you access the interpreter error code after an attempt to interpret. This will contain the error as defined in enum TInterpreter::EErrorCode with TInterpreter::kSuccess being the value for a successful execution.; 7.2.2 Executing a Script From the Invocation; Instead if starting ROOT and running a script on the prompt you can also pass it to ROOT in its invocation:; $ root -l -b 'myCode.C(""some String"", 12)'; The exact kind of quoting depends on your shell; the one shown here works for bash-like shells.; ROOT can evaluate any expression as part of the invocation; another version of the previous example can be spelled like this:; $ root -l -b -e 'gROOT->ProcessLine("".x myCode.C(\""some String\"", 12)"");'; 7.3 C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting; In the next example, we demonstrate three of the most important extensions ROOT and Cling make to C++.

The answer is: when needed. Every object that derives from TObject has a Paint() method. It may be empty, but for graphical objects, this routine contains all the instructions to paint effectively it in the active pad. Since a Pad has the list of objects it owns, it will call successively the Paint() method of each object, thus re-painting the whole pad on the screen. If the object is a sub-pad, its Paint() method will call the Paint() method of the objects attached, recursively calling Paint() for all the objects. Pad painting. In some cases a pad need to be painted during a macro execution.

The method GetPrimitive() of TPad, i.e. TPad::GetPrimitive(const char* name) does exactly this. Since most of the objects that a pad contains derive from TObject, they have a name. The following statement will return a pointer to the object myobjectname and put that pointer into the variable obj. As you can see, the type of returned pointer is TObject*.; root[] obj = gPad->GetPrimitive(""myobjectname""); (class TObject*)0x1063cba8; Even if your object is something more complicated, like a histogram TH1F, this is normal. A function cannot return more than one type. So the one chosen was the lowest common denominator to all possible classes, the class from which everything derives, TObject. How do we get the right pointer then? Simply do a cast of the function output that will transform the output (pointer) into the right type. For example if the object is a TPaveLabel:; root[] obj = (TPaveLabel*",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

For example if the object is a TPaveLabel:; root[] obj = (TPaveLabel*)(gPad->GetPrimitive(""myobjectname"")); (class TPaveLabel*)0x1063cba8; This works for all objects deriving from TObject. However, a question remains. An object has a name if it derives from TNamed, not from TObject. For example, an arrow (TArrow) doesn’t have a name. In that case, the “name” is the name of the class. To know the name of an object, just click with the right button on it. The name appears at the top of the context menu. In case of multiple unnamed objects, a call to GetPrimitive(""className"") returns the instance of the class that was first created. To retrieve a later instance you can use GetListOfPrimitives(), which returns a list of all the objects on the pad. From the list you can select the object you need.; 9.3.1.2 Hiding an Object; Hiding an object in a pad can be made by removing it from the list of objects owned by that pad. This list is accessible by the GetListOfPrimitives() method of TPad. This method returns a pointer to a TList. Suppose we get the pointer to the object, we want to hide, call it obj (see paragraph above). We get the pointer to the list:; root[] li = gPad->GetListOfPrimitives(); Then remove the object from this list:; root[] li->Remove(obj); The object will disappear from the pad as soon as the pad is updated (try to resize it for example). If one wants to make the object reappear:; root[] obj->Draw(); Caution, this will not work with composed objects, for example many histograms drawn on the same plot (with the option “same”). There are other ways! Try to use the method described here for simple objects.; 9.3.2 The Coordinate Systems of a Pad; There are coordinate systems in a TPad: user coordinates, normalized coordinates (NDC), and pixel coordinates. Pad coordinate systems. 9.3.2.1 The User Coordinate System; The most common is the user coordinate system.

This means that they are independent of the user coordinates system, in particular if you have already drawn for example a histogram in the mother pad. The only thing left is to draw the pad:; root[] spad1->Draw(); If you want more sub-pads, you have to repeat this procedure as many times as necessary.; 9.3.4.2 Dividing a Canvas into Sub-Pads; The manual way of dividing a pad into sub-pads is sometimes very tedious. There is a way to automatically generate horizontal and vertical sub-pads inside a given pad.; root[] pad1->Divide(3,2). Dividing a pad into 6 sub-pads. Dividing a pad into 6 sub-pads. If pad1 is a pad then, it will divide the pad into 3 columns of 2 sub-pads. The generated sub-pads get names pad1_i where the index i=1 to nxm (in our case pad1_1, pad1_2…pad1_6). The names pad1_1etc… correspond to new variables in Cling, so you may use them as soon as the executed method was pad->Divide(). However, in a compiled program, one has to access these objects. Remember that a pad contains other objects and that these objects may themselves be pads. So we can use the GetPrimitive() method:; TPad* pad1_1 = (TPad*)(pad1->GetPrimitive(""pad1_1"")); One question remains. In case one does an automatic divide, how one can set the default margins between pads? This is done by adding two parameters to Divide(), which are the margins in x and y:; root[] pad1->Divide(3,2,0.1,0.1); The margins are here set to 10% of the parent pad width.; 9.3.5 Updating the Pad; For performance reasons, a pad is not updated with every change.

For example, changing the coordinates of the pad does not automatically redraw it. Instead, the pad has a “bit-modified” that triggers a redraw. This bit is automatically set by:. Touching the pad with the mouse - for example resizing it with the mouse.; Finishing the execution of a script.; Adding a new primitive or modifying some primitives for example the name and title of an object.; You can also set the “bit-modified” explicitly with the Modified method:; // the pad has changed; root[] pad1->Modified(); // recursively update all modified pads:; root[] c1->Update(); A subsequent call to TCanvas::Update() scans the list of sub-pads and repaints the pads declared modified. In compiled code or in a long macro, you may want to access an object created during the paint process. To do so, you can force the painting with a TCanvas::Update(). For example, a TGraph creates a histogram (TH1) to paint itself. In this case the internal histogram obtained with TGraph::GetHistogram() is created only after the pad is painted. The pad is painted automatically after the script is finished executing or if you force the painting with TPad::Modified() followed by a TCanvas::Update(). Note that it is not necessary to call TPad::Modified() after a call to Draw(). The “bit-modified” is set automatically by Draw(). A note about the “bit-modified” in sub pads: when you want to update a sub pad in your canvas, you need to call pad->Modified() rather than canvas->Modified(), and follow it with a canvas->Update(). If you use canvas->Modified(), followed by a call to canvas->Update(), the sub pad has not been declared modified and it will not be updated.

The syntax is the same as the TeX’s one.; The script $ROOTSYS/tutorials/graphics/tmathtex.C:; gives the following output:. A TMathText example. TMathText uses plain TeX syntax and uses “\” as control instead of “#”. If a piece of text containing “\” is given to TLatex then TMathText is automatically invoked. Therefore, as histograms’ titles, axis titles, labels etc … are drawn using TLatex, the TMathText syntax can be used for them also.; 9.5 Axis; The axis objects are automatically built by various high level objects such as histograms or graphs. Once build, one may access them and change their characteristics. It is also possible, for some particular purposes to build axis on their own. This may be useful for example in the case one wants to draw two axis for the same plot, one on the left and one on the right.; For historical reasons, there are two classes representing axis. TAxis * axis is the axis object, which will be returned when calling the TH1::GetAxis() method.; TAxis *axis = histo->GetXaxis(); Of course, you may do the same for Y and Z-axis. The graphical representation of an axis is done with the TGaxis class. The histogram classes and TGraph generate instances of this class. This is internal and the user should not have to see it.; 9.5.1 Axis Title; The axis title is set, as with all named objects, by; axis->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want"");; When the axis is embedded into a histogram or a graph, one has to first extract the axis object:; h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want""); 9.5.2 Axis Options and Characteristics; The axis optio",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This table is a linked list, which can be accessed from the gROOT object (see TROOT::GetListOfColors()). Each color has an index and when a basic color is defined, two “companion” colors are defined: the dark version and the bright version. Two static functions are available that return the bright or dark color number corresponding to a given color index. If these variants don’t already exist, they are created as needed:; Int_t dark = TColor::GetColorDark(color_index);; Int_t bright = TColor::GetColorBright(color_index);; The dark and bright colors are used to give 3-D effects when drawing various boxes (see TWbox, TPave, TPaveText, TPaveLabel, etc).

The TProcessID title consists of a TUUID object, which provides a globally unique identifier. The TUUID class implements the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), also known as GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). A UUID is 128 bits long, and if generated according to this algorithm, is either guaranteed to be different from all other UUID generated until 3400 A.D. or extremely likely to be different.; The TROOT constructor automatically creates a TProcessID. When a TFile contains referenced objects, the TProcessID object is written to the file. If a file has been written in multiple sessions (same machine or not), a TProcessID is written for each session. The TProcessID objects are used by TRef to uniquely identify the referenced TObject.; When a referenced object is read from a file (its bit kIsReferenced is set), this object is entered into the objects table of the corresponding TProcessID. Each TFile has a list of TProcessIDs (see TFile::fProcessIDs) also accessible from TProcessID::fgPIDs (for all files). When this object is deleted, it is removed from the table via the cleanup mechanism invoked by the TObject destructor. Each TProcessID has a table (TObjArray *fObjects) that keeps track of all referenced objects. If a referenced object has a fUniqueID, a pointer to this unique object may be found using fObjects->At(fUniqueID). In the same way, when a TRef::GetObject is called, GetObject uses its own fUniqueID to find the pointer to the referenced object. See TProcessID::GetObjectWithID and PutObjectWithID.; 11.4.4.2 Object Number; When an object is referenced, a unique identifier is computed and stored in both the fUniqueID of the referenced and referencing object.

The efficiency is due to having a single pointer fPID for all TRefs in the array. It has a dynamic compact table of fUniqueIDs. We recommend that you use a TRefArray rather then a collection of TRefs.; Example:. Suppose a TObjArray *mytracks containing a list of Track objects.; Suppose a TRefArray *pions containing pointers to the pion tracks in mytracks. This list is created with statements like: pions->Add(track);; Suppose a TRefArray *muons containing pointers to the muon tracks in mytracks. The 3 arrays mytracks,pions and muons may be written separately.; 11.5 Schema Evolution; Schema evolution is a problem faced by long-lived data. When a schema changes, existing persistent data can become inaccessible unless the system provides a mechanism to access data created with previous versions of the schema. In the lifetime of collaboration, the class definitions (i.e. the schema) are likely to change frequently. Not only can the class itself change, but any of its parent classes or data member classes can change also. This makes the support for schema evolution necessary.; ROOT fully supports schema evolution. The next figure below illustrates some of the scenarios. The ROOT schema evolution. The top half represents different versions of the shared library with the class definitions. These are the in-memory class versions. The bottom half represents data files that contain different versions of the classes.

To make the numbers more significant, the macro was modified to create 1000 histograms. We have included two more examples to show the impact of compression on Trees in the next chapter.; 11.6.1 Using the General Open Function of TFile; To make life simple we provide a general function to open any type of file (except shared memory files of class TMapFile). This functionality is provided by the static TFile::Open() function:; TFile *TFile::Open(const Text_t *name,Option_t *option="""",; const Text_t *title="""",Int_t compress,Int_t netopt); Depending on the name argument, the function returns a TFile or one of its derivations, for example a TNetXNGFile or a TDavixFile object. In case a URL specifies a local file, a TFile object will be returned (and of course no login information is needed). The arguments of the Open() function are the same as the ones for the TFile constructor.; Using ReOpen() method it is possible to reopen a file with a different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE, RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either “READ” or “UPDATE”. The method returns:. 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;; 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or there were wrong input arguments);; -1 in case of failure.

In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects, ROOT has designed the TTree and TNtuple classes specifically for that purpose. The TTree class is optimized to reduce disk space and enhance access speed. A TNtuple is a TTree that is limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a TTree on the other hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to all the simple types.; When using a TTree, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is important to realize that each object is not written individually, but rather collected and written a bunch at a time.; This is where the TTree takes advantage of compression and will produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the TTree contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects can be compressed.; The TTree reduces the header of each object, but it still contains the class name.

Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the TTree contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects can be compressed.; The TTree reduces the header of each object, but it still contains the class name. Using compression, the class name of each same-class object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using a TTree and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned off, you will not see these large savings.; The TTree is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from any other branch. Now, assume that Px and Py are data members of the event, and we would like to compute Px2 + Py2 for every event and histogram the result.; If we had saved the million events without a TTree we would have to:. read each event in its entirety into memory; extract the Px and Py from the event; compute the sum of the squares; fill a histogram. We would have to do that a million times! This is very time consuming, and we really do not need to read the entire event, every time. All we need are two little data members (Px and Py). On the other hand, if we use a tree with one branch containing Px and another branch containing Py, we can read all values of Px and Py by only reading the Px and Py branches. This makes the use of the TTree very attractive.; 12.2 A Simple TTree; This script builds a TTree from an ASCII file containing statistics about the staff at CERN.

Once the branches are defined, the script reads the data from the ASCII file into C variables and fills the tree. The ASCII file is closed, and the ROOT file is written to disk saving the tree. Remember, trees (and histograms) are created in the current directory, which is the file in our example. Hence a f->Write()saves the tree.; 12.3 Show an Entry with TTree::Show; An easy way to access one entry of a tree is the use the TTree::Show method.

The TClonesArray (pointed to) is split if the split level is greater than two. When the split level is one, the TClonesArray is not split.; If a data member is a pointer to an object, a special branch is created. The branch will be filled by calling the class Streamer function to serialize the object into the branch buffer.; If a data member is an object, the data members of this object are split into branches according to the split-level (i.e. split-level > 2).; Base classes are split when the object is split.; Abstract base classes are never split.; All STL containers are supported. // STL vector of vectors of TAxis*; vector<vector<TAxis *> > fVectAxis;; // STL map of string/vector; map<string,vector<int> > fMapString;; // STL deque of pair; deque<pair<float,float> > fDequePair;. C-structure data members are not supported in split mode.; An object that is not split may be slow to browse.; A STL container that is not split will not be accessible in the browser. 12.10.2 Exempt a Data Member from Splitting; If you are creating a branch with an object and in general you want the data members to be split, but you want to exempt a data member from the split. You can specify this in the comment field of the data member:; class Event : public TObject {; private:; EventHeader fEvtHdr; //|| Don't split the header; 12.10.3 Adding a Branch to Hold a TClonesArray; ROOT has two classes to manage arrays of objects. The TObjArray can manage objects of different classes, and the TClonesArray that specializes in managing objects of the same class (hence the name Clones Array). TClonesArray takes advantage of the constant size of each element when adding the elements to the array. Instead of allocating memory for each new object as it is added, it reuses the memory. Here is an example of the time a TClonesArray can save over a TObjArray. We have 100,000 events, and each has 10,000 tracks, which gives 1,000,000,000 tracks.

After this script is executed we have a ROOT file called tree1.root with a tree called t1. There is a possibility to fill branches one by one using the method TBranch::Fill(). In this case you do not need to call TTree::Fill() method. The entries can be set by TTree::SetEntries(Double_t n). Calling this method makes sense only if the number of existing entries is null.; 12.14.2 Viewing the Tree. The tree1.root file and its tree in the browser and a leaf histogram. In the right panel of the ROOT object browse are the branches: ev, px, py, pz, and random. Note that these are shown as leaves because they are “end” branches with only one leaf. To histogram a leaf, we can simply double click on it in the browser. This is how the tree t1 looks in the Tree Viewer. Here we can add a cut and add other operations for histogramming the leaves. See “The Tree Viewer”. For example, we can plot a two dimensional histogram. The tree viewer. 12.14.3 Reading the Tree; The tree1r function shows how to read the tree and access each entry and each leaf. We first define the variables to hold the read values.; Float_t px, py, pz;; Then we tell the tree to populate these variables when reading an entry. We do this with the method TTree::SetBranchAddress. The first parameter is the branch name, and the second is the address of the variable where the branch data is to be placed. In this example, the branch name is px. This name was given when the tree was written (see tree1w). The second parameter is the address of the variable px.; t1->SetBranchAddress(""px"",&px);; 12.14.3.1 GetEntry; Once the branches have been given the address, a specific entry can be read into the variables with the method TTree::GetEntry(n). It reads all the branches for entry (n) and populates the given address accordingly. By default, GetEntry() reuses the space allocated by the previous object for each branch. You can force the previous object to be automatically deleted if you call mybranch.SetAutoDelete(kTRUE) (",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification. Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains).

Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance.

They use the human ability to spot un-symmetry. Example of spider plot. Variables are represented on individual axes displayed along a circle. For each variable the minimum value sits on the circle’s center, and the maximum on the circle’s radius. Spider plots are not suitable for an accurate graph reading since, by their nature, it can be difficult to read out very detailed values, but they give quickly a global view of an event in order to compare it with the others. In ROOT the spider plot facility is accessed from the tree viewer GUI. The variables to be visualized are selected in the tree viewer and can be scanned using the spider plot button. The tree viewer Graphical User Interface and the Spider Plot Editor. The spider plot graphics editor provides two tabs to interact with the spider plots’ output: the tab “Style” defining the spider layout and the tab “Browse” to navigate in the tree.; 12.20.8.2 Parallel Coordinates Plots. The Parallel Coordinates Plots are a common way of studying and visualizing multiple variables data sets. They were proposed by in A.Inselberg in 1981 as a new way to represent multi-dimensional information. In traditional Cartesian coordinates, axes are mutually perpendicular. In Parallel coordinates, all axes are parallel which allows representing data in much more than three dimensions.

It creates two files similar to TTree::MakeClass.; In the resulting files is a class that is a descendent of TSelector and implements the following methods:. TSelector::Begin() - this method is called every time a loop over the tree starts. This is a convenient place to create your histograms.; TSelector::Notify() - it is called at the first entry of a new tree in a chain.; TSelector::Process() - it is called to process an event. It is the user’s responsibility to read the corresponding entry in memory (may be just a partial read). Once the entry is in memory one can apply a selection and if the event is selected histograms can be filled. Processing stops when this function returns kFALSE. It combines the methods TSelector::ProcessCut() and TSelector::ProcessFill() in one, avoiding the necessity to maintain the state in the class to communicate between these two functions. It reduces the information that needs to be shared between them and promotes a more granular data access by reading branches as they are needed.; TSelector::Terminate() - it is called at the end of a loop on a TTree. This is a convenient place to draw and fit your histograms.; TSelector::Version() - this function provides backward compatibility for old versions and support for the future upgrades.; The TSelector, unlike the resulting class from MakeClass, separates the processing into a ProcessCut() and ProcessFill(), so we can limit reading of branches to the ones we need.; When a selector is used with a TChain in methods Process(), ProcessFill(), ProcessCut(), you must use the pointer to the current TTree to call the method GetEntry(entry).

The original chain has access to all variables in its friends. We can use the TChain::Draw method as if the values in the friends were in the original chain. To specify the chain to use in the Draw method, use:; <chainname>.<branchname>.<varname>; If the variable name is enough to identify uniquely the variable, you can leave out the chain and/or branch name.

The following unordered collections are available:. THashTable; TMap. 16.2 Iterators: Processing a Collection; The concept of processing all the members of a collection is generic, i.e. independent of any specific representation of a collection. To process each object in a collection one needs some type of cursor that is initialized and then steps over each member of the collection in turn. Collection objects could provide this service but there is a snag: as there is only one collection object per collection there would only be one cursor. Instead, to permit the use of as many cursors as required, they are made separate classes called iterator. For each collection class there is an associated iterator class that knows how to sequentially retrieve each member in turn. The relationship between a collection and its iterator is very close and may require that the iterator has full access to the collection (i.e. it is a friend class). In general iterator will be used via the TIter wrapper class. For example:. TList TListIter; TMap TMapIter. 16.3 Foundation Classes; All collections are based on the fundamental classes: TCollection and TIterator. They are so generic that it is not possible to create objects from them; they are only used as base classes for other classes (i.e. they are abstract base classes).; The TCollection class provides the basic protocol (i.e. the minimum set of member functions) that all collection classes have to implement.

However, the TObject class provides some member functions that allow you to tune the behavior of objects in containers. For example, by default two objects are considered equal if their pointers point to the same address. This might be too strict for some classes where equality is already achieved if some or all of the data members are equal. By overriding the following TObject member functions, you can change the behavior of objects in collections:. IsEqual()is used by the FindObject()collection method. By default, IsEqual() compares the two object pointers.; Compare()returns -1, 0 or 1 depending if the object is smaller, equal or larger than the other object. By default, a TObject has not a valid Compare() method.; IsSortable()returns true if the class is sort able (i.e. if it has a valid Compare() method). By default, a TObject is not sort able.; Hash()returns a hash value. It needs to be implemented if an object has to be stored in a collection using a hashing technique, like THashTable, THashList and TMap. By default, Hash() returns the address of the object. It is essential to choose a good hash function.

Objects can be directly accessed via an index. The array expands automatically when objects are added. At creation time one specifies the default array size (default = 16) and lower bound (default = 0). Resizing involves a re-allocation and a copy of the old array to the new. This can be costly if done too often. If possible, set initial size close to expected final size. Index validity is always checked (if you are 100% sure and maximum performance is needed you can use UnCheckedAt() instead of At() or operator[]). If the stored objects are sort able the array can be sorted using Sort(). Once sorted, efficient searching is possible via the BinarySearch() method.

In the right panel, we will see all the volumes contained by TOP (if the same is positioned 4 times we will get 4 identical items). This rule will apply to any clicked volume in the hierarchy. Note that right clicking a volume item activates the volume context menu containing several specific methods. We will call the volume hierarchy developed in this way as the logical geometry graph. The volume objects are nodes inside this graph and the same volume can be accessed starting from different branches.; On the other hand, the real geometrical objects that are seen when visualizing or tracking the geometry are depicted in the TOP_1 branch.

This is responsible for their final deletion. Shapes can be created without name if their retrieval by name is no needed. Generally shapes are objects that are useful only at geometry creation stage. The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a given volume and it is always accessible at that level. Several volumes may reference a single shape; therefore its deletion is not possible once volumes were defined based on it.; The navigation features related for instance to tracking particles are performed in the following way: Each shape implement its specific algorithms for all required tasks in its local reference system. Note that the manager class handles global queries related to geometry. However, shape-related queries might be sometimes useful:; Bool_t TGeoShape::Contains(Double_t *point[3]);; The method above returns kTRUE if the point *point is actually inside the shape.

It defines a global pointer gGeoManager in order to be fully accessible from external code. The manager class is the owner of all geometry objects defined in a session; therefore, users must not try to control their deletion. It contains lists of media, materials, transformations, shapes and volumes. A special case is the one of geometrical transformations. When creating a matrix or a translation, this is by default owned by external objects. The manager class becomes owner of all transformations used for positioning volumes. In order to force the ownership for other transformations, one can use TGeoMatrix::RegisterYourself() method. Do not be therefore surprised that some transformations cannot be found by name when creating a composite shape for instance if you did not register them after creation.; Logical nodes (positioned volumes) are created and destroyed by the TGeoVolume class. Physical nodes and their global transformations are subjected to a caching mechanism due to the sometimes very large memory requirements of logica",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This is linked with ROOT graphical libraries loaded on demand in order to control visualization actions.; 18.5 Navigation and Tracking; Tracking is the feature allowing the transport of a given particle knowing its kinematics. A state is determined by any combination of the position \(\vec{r}\) and direction \(\vec{n}\) with respect to the world reference frame. The direction \(\vec{n}\) must be a unit vector having as components the director cosines. The full classification of a given state will provide the following information: the deepest physical node containing the position vector, the distance to the closest boundary along the direction vector, the next physical node after propagating the current point with this distance and the safety distance to the nearest boundary. This information allows the propagation of particles inside a detector geometry by taking into account both geometrical and physical constraints.; We will hereby describe the user interface of TGeo to access tracking functionality. This allows either developing a tracker for simple navigation within a given geometry, either interfacing to an external tracking engine such as GEANT. Note that the abstract interface for external trackers can be found in $ROOTSYS/vmc folder and it can be used to run GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA-based simulations (*) by using directly a geometry described with ROOT.; The interface methods related to tracking are incorporated into TGeoManager class and implemented in the navigator class TGeoNavigator. In order to be able to start tracking, one has to define the initial state providing the starting point \(\vec{r_0}\) and direction \(\vec{n_0}\) . There are several ways of doing that.; 18.5.1 TGeoNavigator Class; One geometry may have several independent navigators to query to localize points or compute distances.

Each geometry query affects these variables, so the only way in testing several navigation alternatives and remembering the active navigation state is to use parallel navigation. The following paragraphs will describe the usage of a single navigator. All setters/getters for navigation state parameters as well as navigation queries provided by TGeoNavigator are interfaced by TGeoManager and will act on the current navigator.; 18.5.2 Initializing the Starting Point; The current point (x,y,z) known by the modeller is stored as Double_t fCurrentPoint[3] by t",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

We will call this navigation history management, which in most of the cases can be performed by handling the state identifiers. For quite big geometries, state indexing is not possible anymore and will be automatically disabled by the modeller. Fortunately there is a backup solution working in any condition: the modeller maintains a stack of states that is internally used by its own navigation algorithms, but user code is also allowed to access it. This works on any stack principle by using PUSH and POP calls and user code is responsible for popping the pushed states in order to keep the stack clean.; // push the current state in the stack; Int_t index = gGeoManager->PushPath();; // push state and current point; Int_t index = gGeoManager->PushPoint();; // retrieves the last pushed state (decrements stack index); gGeoManager->PopPath();; // the same but retrieves also the point location; gGeoManager->PopPoint();; // just decrement stack index without changing state; gGeoManager->PopDummy();; // retrieves a state at given index without changing stack index; gGeoManager->PopPath(Int_t index);; 18.5.7 Navigation Queries; After initializing the current state related to a given point and direction defined in MARS (‘Where am I?'), one can query for several geometrical quantities.

They generally apply only to the visible parts of the drawn geometry in order to ease geometry checking, and their implementation is in the TGeoChecker class. The checking package contains an overlap checker and several utility methods that generally have visualization outputs.; 18.6.1 The Overlap Checker; An overlap is any region in the Euclidian space being contained by more than one positioned volume. Due to the containment scheme used by the modeller, all points inside a volume have to be also contained by the mother therefore are overlapping in that sense. This category of overlaps is ignored due to the fact that any such point is treated as belonging to the deepest node in the hierarchy. Extruding volumes. A volume containment region is in fact the result of the subtraction of all daughters.

This library is dynamically loaded by the plug-in manager only when drawing features are requested. The geometrical structures that can be visualized are volumes and volume hierarchies.; The main component of the visualization system is volume primitive painting in a ROOT pad. Starting from this one, several specific options or subsystems are available, like: X3D viewing using hidden line and surface removal algorithms, OpenGL viewing* or ray tracing.; The method TGeoManager::GetGeomPainter()loads the painting library in memory.; This is generally not needed since it is called automatically by TGeoVolume::Draw() as well as by few other methods setting visualization attributes.; 18.7.1 Drawing Volumes and Hierarchies of Volumes; The first thing one would like to do after building some geometry is to visualize the volume tree. This provides the fastest validation check for most common coding or design mistakes. As soon as the geometry is successfully closed, one should draw it starting from the top-level volume:; //... code for geometry building; root[] gGeoManager->CloseGeometry();; root[] gGeoManager->GetMasterVolume()->Draw();; Doing this ensures that the original top-level volume of the geometry is drawn, even if another volume is currently the geometry root. OK, I suppose you already did that with your simple geometry and immediately noticed a new ROOT canvas popping-up and having some more or less strange picture inside. Here are few questions that might come:; Q: “The picture is strangely rotated; where are the coordinate axes?”; A: If drawn in a new canvas, any view has some default viewpoint, center of view and size. One can then perform mouse/keyboard actions to change them:. Mouse left-click and drag will rotate the view;; Some keys can be pressed when the view canvas is selected: J/K zoom/un-zoom, U/I move up/down, L/H move left/right.

The pixel color is derived from the properties of the first crossed surface, according some illumination model and material optical properties. While there are currently existing quite sophisticated ray tracing models, TGeo is currently using a very simple approach where the light source is matching the eye position (no shadows or back-tracing of the reflected ray). In future we are considering providing a base class in order to be able to derive more complex models.; Due to the fact that the number of rays that have to be tracked matches the size in pixels of the pad, the time required by this algorithm is proportional to the pad size. On the other hand, the speed is quite acceptable for the default ROOT pad size and the images produced by using this technique have high quality. Since the algorithm is practically using all navigation features, producing ray-traced pictures is also a geometry validation check. Ray tracing can be activated at volume level as the normal Draw().

This means that the region inside the clipping shape is subtracted from the current drawn geometry (become invisible). In order to activate clipping, one has to first define the clipping shape(s):; 1. TGeoShape *clip1, *clip2, ...; One might switch between several clipping shapes.

The returned node is the next crossed one, but the physical path (state) AFTER crossing the boundary is not determined. In order to find out this new state, one has to propagate the point with a distance slightly bigger that the computed step value (which is accurate within numerical precision). A method that performs this task finding the next location is TGeoManager::Step(), described in "" Making a Step "", but users may implement more precise methods to insure post-step boundary crossing.; 18.11 Geometry Graphical User Interface; The geombuilder package allows you to create and edit geometries. The package provides a library of all GUI classes related to geometry. Each editable geometry class TGeoXXX have a correspondent editor TGeoXXXEditor that provides a graphics user interface allowing to edit some (or all) parameters of a geometry object. The editable objects are geometry manager, volumes, nodes, shapes, media, materials and matrices. The interfaces provide also access to specific functionality of geometry objects. The editing mechanism is based on ROOT GED (Graphics Editors) functionality and the library is loaded using the plug-in mechanism.; 18.11.1 Editing a Geometry; There are two different use cases having different ways of invoking the geometry editors.

Its interoperability with other programming languages, both for extending Python as well as embedding it, is excellent and many existing third-party applications and libraries have therefore so-called “Python bindings.” PyROOT provides Python bindings for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of user-level objects from one interpreter to the other. PyROOT enables access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from the python interpreter.; 19.1 PyROOT Overview; The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming, including high performance and distributed parallel code (see http://www.scipy.org). It is the second most popular scripting language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a “glue language”: practically every library and application these days comes with Python bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated).; PyROOT, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus the “glue-ing” of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or applications that provide Python bindings. Further, PyROOT can be loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary) access to Python classes.

Further, PyROOT can be loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary) access to Python classes. The best way to understand the benefits of PyROOT is through a few examples.; 19.1.1 Glue-ing Applications; The PyQt library, see http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt, provides Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI framework ( http://www.trolltech.com). With PyROOT and PyQt, adding ROOT application layer code to a Qt GUI, becomes children play. The following example shows how a Python class can be used to have ROOT code respond to a click on a Qt widget.; # Glue-ing Qt and ROOT through Python; import sys, ROOT; from qt import *. theApp = QApplication( sys.argv); box = QVBox(); box.resize(QSize(40,10).expandedTo(box.minimumSizeHint())). class myButton(QPushButton):; def __init__( self,label,master):; QPushButton.__init__(self,label,master); self.setFont( QFont('Times',18,QFont.Bold)). def browse(self):; self.b = ROOT.TBrowser(). bb = myButton('browser',box); QObject.connect( bb,SIGNAL('clicked()'),bb.browse). theA",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Currently, ROOT objects and built-in types can cross the boundary between the two interpreters, but other objects are much more restricted. For example, for a Python object to cross, it has to be a class instance, and its class has to be known to Cling first (i.e. the class has to cross first, before the instance can). All other cross-coding is based on strings that are run on the Python interpreter and vise-versa.; With the ROOT v4.00/06 and later, the TPython class will be loaded automatically on use, for older editions, the libPyROOT.so needs to be loaded first before use. It is possible to switch between interpreters by calling TPython::Prompt() on the ROOT side, while returning with ^D (EOF). State is preserved between successive switches, and string based cross calls can nest as long as shared resources are properly handled.; // Example: accessing the Python interpreter from ROOT; // either load PyROOT explicitly or rely on auto-loading; root[] gSystem->Load( ""libPyROOT"" );; root[] TPython::Exec(""print1+1"");; 2. // create a TBrowser on the Python side, and transfer it back and forth; root[] TBrowser* b = (void*)TPython::Eval(""ROOT.TBrowser()"");; (class TObject*)0x8d1daa0; root[] TPython::Bind(b,""b"");. // builtin variables can cross-over (after the call i==2); root[] int i = TPython::Eval( ""1+1"" );; root[] i; (int)2; 19.1.4 Installation; There are several ways of obtaining PyROOT, and which is best depends on your specific situation. If you work at CERN, you can use the installation available on afs. Otherwise, you will want to build from source, as PyROOT is not build by default in the binaries distributed from the ROOT project site. If you download the ROOT binaries, take care to download and install the Python distribution from http://www.python.org/ against which they were built.; 19.1.4.1 Environment Settings; ROOT installations with the build of PyROOT enabled are available from the CERN afs ce",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Furthermore, because of this approach, <tab>-completion will usually not be available until after the first use (and hence creation) of a class.; Access to class static functions, public data members, enums, etc. is as expected. Many more example uses of ROOT classes from Python can be found in the tutorials directory in the ROOT distribution. The recipes section contains a description on working with your own classes (see “Using Your Own Classes”).; 19.1.5.2 Access to STL Classes; The STL classes live in the ROOT.std namespace (or, if you prefer to get them from there, in the ROOT module directly, but doing so makes the code less clear, of course). Be careful in their use, because Python already has types called “string” and “list.”; In order to understand how to get access to a templated class, think of the general template as a meta class. By instantiating the meta class with the proper parameters, you get an actual class, which can then be used to create object instances. An example usage:; >>> from ROOT import std; >>> v = std.vector(int)(); >>> for i in range(0,10):; ... v.push_back(i); ...; >>> for i in v:; ... print(i, end=' '); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; >>>; >>> list(v); [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; >>>; The parameters to the template instantiation can either be an actual type or value (as is used here, “int”), or a string representation of the parameters (e.g. “‘double’”), or a mixture of both (e.g. “‘TCanvas, 0’” or “‘double’, 0” ). The “std::vector<int>” class is one of the classes builtin by default into the Cling extension dlls. You will get a non-functional class (instances of which can still be passed around to C++) if the corresponding dictionary doesn’t exist.; 19.1.5.3 Access to ROOT Globals; Most globals and global functions can be imported directly fr",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The following session shows that in detail:; >>> from ROOT import *; >>> print(gDebug); 0; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'gDebug = 7;' ); >>> print(gDebug); 0 # local gDebug is unchanged; >>> gDebug = 5 # changes _local_ reference only; >>> print(gDebug); 5 # locally correct, but ...; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'cout << gDebug << endl;' ); 7 # ... ROOT global unchanged; >>> import ROOT; >>> print(ROOT.gDebug); 7 # still the old value (not '5'); >>> ROOT.gDebug = 3 # changes ROOT module reference; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'cout << gDebug << endl;' ); 3 # ROOT global properly changed; >>>; The above is another good reason to prefer ‘import ROOT’ over ‘from ROOT import *’.; 19.1.5.4 Access to Python; The access to Python from Cling goes through the TPython class, or directly if a Python object or class has crossed the border. The TPython class, which looks approximately like this:; class TPython {. public:; // load a Python script as if it were a macro; static void LoadMacro(const char* name);. // execute a Python statement (e.g. ""import ROOT""); static void Exec(const char* cmd);. // evaluate a Python expression (e.g. ""1+1""); static const TPyReturn& Eval(const char* expr);. // bind a ROOT object with, at the Python side, the name ""label""; static bool Bind(TObject* obj,const char* label);. // enter an interactive Python session (exit with ^D); static void Prompt();; };; LoadMacro(const char* name) - the argument is a name of a Python file that is to be executed ('execfile'), after which any new classes are automatically made available to Cling. Since it is non-selective, use with care.; ExecScript(const char* name,int argc=0,const char** argv=0) - the argument is a name of a python file that is to be executed (‘execfile’) in a private ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

If a ROOT type is returned, an explicit cast to void* is needed to assign the return value to a local pointer (which may have a different type), whereas builtin types will be cast implicitly, if possible, to the type of the local variable to which they are assigned.; Bind(TObject* obj,const char* label) - transfer a ROOT object from the Cling to the Python interpreter, where it will be referenced with a variable called “label”.; Prompt() - Transfer the interactive prompt to Python.; With the ROOT v4.00/06 and later, the TPython class will be loaded automatically on use, for older editions, the libPyROOT.so needs to be loaded first with gSystem->Load() before use. Refer back to the other example of the use of TPython that was given in “Access to Python from ROOT”.; To show in detail how Python access can be used, an example Python module is needed, as follows:; print('creating class MyPyClass ... '); class MyPyClass:; def __init__(self):; print('in MyPyClass.__init__'); self._browser = None; def gime(self, what):; return what; This module can now be loaded into a Cling session, the class used to instantiate objects, and their member functions called for showing how different types can cross:; root[] TPython::LoadMacro(""MyPyClass.py"");; creating class MyPyClass ...; root[] MyPyClass m;; in MyPyClass.__init__; root[] char* s = m.gime(""aap"");; root[] s; (char* 0x41ee7754)""aap""; Note that the LoadMacro() call makes the class automatically available, such that it can be used directly. Otherwise, a gROOT->GetClass() call is required first.; 19.1.5.5 Callbacks; The simplest way of setting a callback to Python from Cling, e.g. for a button, is by providing the execution string. See for example tutorials/pyroot/demo.py that comes with the ROOT installation:; # [..]; bar = ROOT.TControlBar('vertical','Demos'); bar.AddBu",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

After the fit, you can retrieve the fit parameters from the TF1 instance. For example:; from ROOT import TF1, TH1F, TCanvas. class Linear:; def __call__( self, x, par ):; return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]. # create a linear function for fitting; f = TF1('pyf3',Linear(),-1.,1.,2). # create and fill a histogram; h = TH1F('h','test',100,-1.,1.); f2 = TF1('cf2','6.+x*4.5',-1.,1.); h.FillRandom('cf2',10000). # fit the histo with the python 'linear' function; h.Fit(f). # print results; par = f.GetParameters(); print('fit results: const =', par[0], ',pitch =', par[1]); 19.1.9 Working with Trees; Next to making histograms, working with trees is probably the most common part of any analysis. The TTree implementation uses pointers and dedicated buffers to reduce the memory usage and to speed up access. Consequently, mapping TTree functionality to Python is not straightforward, and most of the following features are implemented in ROOT release 4.01/04 and later only, whereas you will need 5.02 if you require all of them.; 19.1.9.1 Accessing an Existing Tree; Let us assume that you have a file containing TTrees, TChains, or TNtuples and want to read the contents for use in your analysis code. This is commonly the case when you work with the result of the reconstruction software of your experiment (e.g. the combined ntuple in ATLAS). The following example code outlines the main steps (you can run it on the result of the tree1.C macro):; from ROOT import TFile. # open the file; myfile = TFile('tree1.root'). # retrieve the ntuple of interest; mychain = myfile.Get('t1'); entries = mychain.GetEntriesFast(). for jentry in xrange(entries):; # get the next tree in the chain and verify; ientry = mychain.LoadTree(jentry); if ientry < 0:; b",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

For example:; # loop over array tree element; for d in mychain.mydoubles:; print(d). # direct access into an array tree element; i5 = mychain.myints[5]; 19.1.9.2 Writing a Tree; Writing a ROOT TTree in a Python session is a little convoluted, if only because you will need a C++ class to make sure that data members can be mapped, unless you are working with built-in types.

However, data members of such objects that are of built-in types, still require something extra since they are normally translated to Python primitive types on access and hence their address cannot be taken. For that purpose, there is the AddressOf() function.

File descriptors; Signal actions; Shared libraries; Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes, semaphores, or shared memory). 23.1.2 Thread Properties; A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include the following properties:. Stack; Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority); Set of pending and blocked signals; Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, errno. In multi-threaded systems, errno is no longer a global variable, but usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific errno value. Some other systems may provide other implementations of errno. With respect to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the gPad pointer, which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any thread or the main thread.; Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected. For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all threads.; 23.1.3 The Initial Thread; When a process is created, one thread is automatically created. This thread is called the initial thread or the main thread.

Some actions can be dangerous. For example, when two threads create a histogram object, ROOT allocates memory and puts them to the same collection. If it happens at the same time, the results are undetermined. To avoid this problem, the user has to synchronize these actions with:; TThread::Lock() // Locking the following part of code; ... // Create an object, etc...; TThread::UnLock() // Unlocking; The code between Lock() and UnLock() will be performed uninterrupted. No other threads can perform actions or access objects/collections while it is being executed. The methods TThread::Lock()and TThread::UnLock() internally use a global TMutex instance for locking.; The user may also define their own TMutex MyMutex instance and may locally protect their asynchronous actions by calling MyMutex.Lock() and MyMutex.UnLock().; 23.2.4.2 Synchronous Actions: TCondition; To synchronize the actions of different threads you can use the TCondition class, which provides a signaling mechanism. The TCondition instance must be accessible by all threads that need to use it, i.e. it should be a global object (or a member of the class which owns the threaded methods, see below). To create a TCondition object, a TMutex instance is required for the Wait and TimedWait locking methods.

Widgets created by ROOT GUI classes. Any custom widget can be created by sub classing existing widgets. To achieve a better understanding of the widgets’ properties they are separated by their type and their inheritance. As all of them inherit from TGObject and most from TGWidget, these base classes are described first.; 25.5.1 TGObject; TGObject is the base class for all ROOT GUI classes. It inherits from TObject. The two data members of this class contain important information about X11/Win32 window identifier and the connection to the host’s graphics system. Every GUI element, which derives from TGObject has access to the TGClient via the data member fClient of TGObject. TGClient creates the connection with the host’s graphics system and sets up the complete graphics system for all widgets.; 25.5.2 TGWidget; The widgets base class TGWidget is typically used as a mix-in class via multiple inheritances. Its properties are available for all deriving widgets: TGButton, TGComboBox, TGTab, TGColorPalette, TGColorPick, TGDoubleSlider, TGListTree, TGNumberEntry, TGScrollBar, TGShutterItem, TGTextEntry, TGSlider, TGListBox, TGView.; This class has four data members keeping information about the widget id - important for event processing, the window which handles the widget’s events, the widget status flags and the assigned command (if there is any).

Let’s have a minimal class declaration:; class MyClass {; private:; Int_t fValue;; public:; MyClass() { fValue=0; }; Int_t GetValue() const { return fValue; }; void SetValue(Int_t);; };; It will become the following as interpreted:; class MyClass {; RQ_OBJECT(""MyClass""); private:; Int_t fValue;; public:; MyClass() { fValue=0; }; Int_t GetValue() const { return fValue; }; void SetValue(Int_t); // *SIGNAL*; };; Both class declarations have the same data member and public methods to access the value. By placing the RQ_OBJECT(""MyClass"") macro inside the MyClass body (MyClass is not inherited from TQObject) we allow this class to use the signal/slot communication. Any instance of this class can tell the outside world that the state of its data member has changed by emitting a signal SetValue(Int_t). A possible implementation of MyClass::SetValue() can be:; void MyClass::SetValue(Int_t v) {; if (v != fValue) {; fValue = v;; Emit(""SetValue(Int_t)"",v);; }; }; The line Emit(""SetValue(Int_t)"",v) activates the signal SetValue(Int_t) with argument v. You can use any of the methods TQObject::Emit(""full_method_name"",arguments) to emit a signal. We create two instances of MyClass and connect them together:; MyClass *objA = new MyClass();; MyClass",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

It is possible to pass a parameter by value to a slot method in the following way:; Connect(myButton, ""Pressed()"", ""TH1"", hist, ""SetMaximum(=123) "");; Connect(myButton, ""Pressed()"", ""TH1"", hist, ""Draw(=\""LEGO\"")"");; As you see the parameter’s value is preceded by the equation symbol (=). Please note that this method of passing arguments by value works only if the signal has less arguments than the slot. If the signal method has the same number of arguments, then the slot argument will be overwritten with the signal argument. In the example below, the Draw option would be overwritten in the first line by the emitted signal argument. The second line would be ok, the argument passed by value would not be overwritten.; Connect(myComboBox, ""Selected(const char*)"", ""TTree"", myTree, ""Draw(=\""x\"")"");; Connect(myComboBox, ""Selected(const char*)"", ""TTree"", myTree, ""Draw(const char*, =\"" y==1 \"")"");; In addition, if the signal and slot arguments differ in argument type, passing arguments by value leads to undefined behaviour and illegal memory access, as the signal argument will be casted to another data type. In the example below, if Selected emits Int_t = 1, then ChangeText will try to read a TString at address 0x1.; Connect(myComboBox, ""Selected(Int_t)"", ""TGTextButton"", myButton, ""ChangeText(=\""Hello\"")"");; You have the possibility to destroy a signal/slot connection by using Disconnect() methods. There are three ways to do this:; 1/ to destroy all connections to an object’s signals;; 2/ to destroy all connections to a particular object’s signal; 3/ to detach an object from a specific receiver:; Disconnect(myObgect); // case 1; Disconnect(myObgect, ""mySignal""); // case 2; Disconnect(myObgect,0,myReceiver,0); // case 3; Three parameters of these methods could be replaced by 0. The meaning in these cases would be “any signal”, “any receiving object”, “any slot of the receiving object”, i.e. 0 is u",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

We already used its constructor in the example. The button label indicates the action to be taken when the button is selected or pressed. The text can be a hot string defining a hot key (known as shortcut key also) for this selection. The hot key is an underlined character in a button label that shows the assigned keyboard mnemonic for its choice. A button that prompts more information for users has the label generally followed by ellipsis (…). As we saw the hot strings “&Draw” and “&Exit” define the text labels “Draw” and “Exit” and keyboard mnemonics Alt+D, Alt+E for their selection. The letter D and E appear underlined on the screen. All text buttons should have a unique shortcut key with the exception of OK and Cancel.; These buttons are usually placed within a window to provide fast access to frequently used or critical commands. They help in situations where a command is not available through the menu bar. You already know that a command string can be passed in the text button via the constructor:; TGTextButton(const TGWindow *p, const char *s, const char *cmd,; Int_t id, GContext_t norm, FontStruct_t font,; UInt_t options);; A button label can be changed by SetText(new_label). There are important guidelines to be followed about a button label. The text has to provide a meaningful description of the performed action. The single-word label should be used whenever possible, only two-three words for clarity, if necessary. Do not number labels.

The only disadvantage of the text and picture buttons is that they consume considerable screen space if they are many. Having no more than six command buttons per window or dialog box helps to appropriately balance the application’s effectiveness, its real efficiency, and the operational simplicity.; The classes TGRadioButton and TGCheckButton present the option buttons in ROOT. Like the text buttons, they have text or hot string as a label. Radio buttons are grouped in logical sets of two or more and appear with a text label to the right. The choices are mutually exclusive and only one setting is permitted at one time. They represent visually all alternatives and it is easy to access and compare choices. They facilitate the situations where all alternatives cannot be easily remembered or where displaying the alternatives together helps to understand and select the proper choice. It is very useful to provide a default setting whenever it is possible. When it is not possible to establish a default setting because of the nature of the information, it is better to leave all radio buttons blank. A columnar orientation is the preferred manner of radio buttons presentation. If the vertical space on the window is limited, they can be oriented horizontally. Selection choices should be organized logically in groups.

TGHButtonGroup organize button widgets in a group of one horizontal row, TGVButtonGroup in a group of one column. You can also organize buttons in rows and columns using the provided constructor and TGMatrixLayout.; Do not use a radio button to indicate the presence or absence of a state - use a check box instead. To have the check button “Event Status” and to set it as selected we need to write:; TGCheckButton *estat = new TGCheckButton(p, ""Event Status"",1);; estat->SetState(kButtonDown);; Check boxes show the selected choices and any number of them can be selected, including none. Their proper usage is for setting attributes, properties or values; also for data or choices that are discrete, small and fixed in number, not easily remembered. With check boxes all alternatives are visible: it is easy to access and compare choices because they can all be seen together. Each option acts as a switch and can be either “on” or “off”. It is never changed in contents. Checkboxes differ from radio buttons in that they permit selection of more than one alternative. Each box can be switched on or off independently. These buttons can be used alone or grouped in sets. It is good practice to provide default settings for check boxes whenever it is possible. This can be done by:; SetState(EButtonState state); The parameter state can be one of kButtonUp, kButtonDown, kButtonEngaged, kButtonDisabled.; Check boxes can be used to affect other controls. The contents of a list can, for example, be filtered by setting a check box. In any case, use a check box only when both states of a choice are clearly opposite and unambiguous. If opposite states are not clear, it is better to use two radio buttons.; Choice description, i.e. check box label, must be clear, meaningful, fully spelled out, and displayed in mi",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The step size can be selected with control and shift keys:. –small step (1 unit/factor of 3); Shift medium step (10 units/factor of 10); Controllarge step (100 units/factor of 30); Shift+Controlhuge step (1000 units/factor of 100). The steps are either linear or logarithmic. The default behavior is set when the entry field is created, but it can be changed by pressing the alt key at the same time.; 25.8.4 Menus; Menus provide a list of commands or options helping the user to select and to perform a task. The menu system classes are TGMenuBar, TGMenuTitle, TGPopupMenu, and TGMenuEntry.; The TGMenuBar class implements a menu bar widget. It is used to specify and provide access to common and frequently used application actions described in menu titles, implemented by TGMenuTitle class. The menu bar is the highest-level of the menu system and it is a starting point for all interactions. Also, it is always visible and allows using the keyboard equivalents. The geometry of the menu bar is automatically set to the parent widget, i.e. the menu bar automatically resizes itself so that it has the same width as its parent (typically TGMainFrame).; The menu bar is as a container for its menus - objects of the type TGPopupMenu. Popup menus can appear in a menu bar. They can be a sub-menu of another popup menu (cascading menus) or can be standalone (as a context menu). They are made of one or more menu items choices. When displayed, the menu items are arranged in a vertical list. Usually they correspond to actions (e.g. Open). These items can be labeled with text, graphics or a combination of both.

A menu title should have a one-word name that reflects the purpose of all items within the corresponding popup menu. It should also have a defined character as its unique access key. The second parameter is the popup menu we would like to add. The third one is an object of TGLayoutHints type that defines how the menu title will be laid out in the menu bar.

Potentially destructive buttons must be separated from them to avoid accidental activation and potentially catastrophic results. Temporarily not available items should be displayed grayed out.; 25.8.6 List Boxes; The purpose of a list box is to display a collection of items from which single or multiple selection can be made. It is always visible, having a scroll bar when the displayed area is not enough to show all items. The choices may be mutually exclusive (a list box with single selection) or not mutually exclusive (a list box with multiple selection). The proper usage of the list boxes is for selecting values, or objects, or setting attributes. You have to create them to display 4 to 8 choices at one time (3 is a required minimum in case of lack of screen space). The list should contain not more than 40 items accessible by scrolling view (vertical scroll bar). If more are required, you should provide a method for using search criteria or scoping the options. The best list boxes use is for textual data or choices. They should be wide enough to display fully all items. When it is not possible, break the long items with ellipsis and provide tool tip that displays the full item text.; The list box widget is represented by TGListBox, TGLBContainer, TGLBEntry and TGTextLBEntry classes. Currently entries are simple text strings (TGTextLBEntry). A TGListBox looks a lot like a TGCanvas. It has a TGViewPort containing a TGLBContainer which contains the entries and it also has a vertical scrollbar which becomes visible if there are more items than fit in the visible part of the container. The TGListBox is user callable. The other classes are service classes of the list box.

They are usually generated externally, which poses problems with where to keep the images, and how to keep them up to date. THtml solves this by offering a few special documentation elements: macro and latex directives.; 27.3.1 Latex Directive; Documentation surrounded by the keywords BEGIN_LATEX / END_LATEX will be passed to ROOT Latex engine TLatex. The keywords can be written with small or capital letters (case insensitive). The output will be stored to an image file, which gets automatically included in the documentation.; // This function calculates BEGIN_LATEX; // F(x_{#frac{1}{2}}) = #prod(x < x_{#frac{1}{2}}) = #frac{1}{2}; // END_LATEX; THtml will inject the following picture:. The image file name is generated from the formula and will be unique for all the documentation. It is stored along-side the documentation, and it will be automatically regenerated when the documentation is updated. The handling of the Latex directive is done by the class TDocLatexDirective.; The BEGIN_LATEX keyword can take the following parameters:. fontsize: sets the TLatex font size. The default value is 16.; separator: sets a list of characters for which a new column will be started. This allows aligned, multi-line, multi-column layout, which can be useful for e.g. mathematical derivations. It is unset by default, meaning the Latex directive will only generate one column.; rseparator: like separator, but a regular expression. Columns start with a match of this regular expression. Only one of separator or rseparator can be given.; align: defines the alignment of the columns. Note that the column delim",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

For full details see the file LICENSE in the ROOT distribution.; 28.2 Installing ROOT; To install ROOT you will need to go to the ROOT website at: https://root.cern/install/; You have a choice to download the binaries or the source. The source is quicker to transfer since it is only 31 MB, but you will need to compile and link it. The binaries range from 50 MB to 100 MB depending on the target platform.; 28.3 Choosing a Version; The ROOT developers follow the principle of “release early and release often”, however a very large portion of a user base requires a stable product therefore generally three versions of the system is available for download - new, old and pro:. The new version evolves quickly, with weekly or bi-weekly releases. Use this to get access to the latest and greatest, but it may not be stable. By trying out the new version you can help us converge quickly to a stable version that can then become the new pro version. If you are a new user we would advice you to try the new version.; The pro (production) version is a version we feel comfortable with to exposing to a large audience for serious work. The change rate of this version is much lower than for the new version, it is about 3 to 6 months.; The old version is the previous pro version that people might need for some time before switching the new pro version. The old change rate is the same as for pro. 28.4 Installing Precompiled Binaries; The binaries are available for downloading from https://root.cern/install/. Once downloaded you need to unzip and de-tar the file. For example, if you have downloaded ROOT v5.30 for Linux-SLC5:; % gunzip root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar.gz; % tar xvf root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar; This will create the directory root.

They had lead successful projects such as PAW, PIAF, and GEANT, and they knew PAW the twenty-year-old FORTRAN libraries had reached their limits. Although still very popular, these tools could not scale up to the challenges offered by the Large Hadron Collider, where the data is a few orders of magnitude larger than anything seen before.; At the same time, computer science had made leaps of progress especially in the area of Object Oriented Design, and René and Fons were ready to take advantage of it.; ROOT was developed in the context of the NA49 experiment at CERN. NA49 has generated an impressive amount of data, around 10 Terabytes per run. This rate provided the ideal environment to develop and test the next generation data analysis.; ROOT was, and still is, developed in the “Bazaar style”, a term from the book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” by Eric S. Raymond. It means a liberal, informal development style that heavily relies on the diverse and deep talent of the user community. The result is that physicists developed ROOT for themselves; this made it specific, appropriate, useful, and over time refined and very powerful. The development of ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming co-developers.; When it comes to storing and mining large amount of data, physics plows the way with its Terabytes, but other fields and industry follow close behind as they acquiring more and more data over time.

More users find more bugs, because they stress the program in different ways. By now, after ten years, the age of ROOT is quite mature. Most likely, you will find the features you are looking for, and if you have found a hole, you are encouraged to participate in the dialog and post your suggestion or even implementation on the ROOT forum.; 1.1 The ROOT forum; If you have a question, it is likely that it has been asked, answered, and stored in the ROOT Forum.

You also have to learn the framework interfaces, which in this analogy is the same as learning how to use a telephone.; If you are interested in doing physics, a good HEP framework will save you much work. Next is a list of the more commonly used components of ROOT: Command Line Interpreter, Histograms and Fitting, Writing a Graphical User Interface, 2D Graphics, Input/Output , Collection Classes, Script Processor.; There are also less commonly used components, as: 3D Graphics, Parallel Processing (PROOF), Run Time Type Identification (RTTI), Socket and Network Communication, Threads.; 1.4.1.1 Advantages of Frameworks; The benefits of frameworks can be summarized as follows:. Less code to write - the programmer should be able to use and reuse the majority of the existing code. Basic functionality, such as fitting and histogramming are implemented and ready to use and customize.; More reliable and robust code - the code inherited from a framework has already been tested and integrated with the rest of the framework.; More consistent and modular code - the code reuse provides consistency and common capabilities between programs, no matter who writes them. Frameworks make it easier to break programs into smaller pieces.; More focus on areas of expertise - users can concentrate on their particular problem domain. They do not have to be experts at writing user interfaces, graphics, or networking to use the frameworks that provide those services. 1.4.2 Why Object-Oriented?; Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to Procedure-Oriented Programming:. Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity for reuse.; Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify objects.; Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the relationships among them.; Complexity is reduced because there is little growth of ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The rootalias.C file is loaded but not executed. It typically contains small utility functions. For example, the rootalias.C script that comes with the ROOT distributions (located in $ROOTSYS/tutorials) defines the function edit(char *file). This allows the user to call the editor from the command line. This particular function will start the VI editor if the environment variable EDITOR is not set.; root[0] edit(""c1.C""); For more details, see $ROOTSYS/tutorials/rootalias.C.; 2.7.2 History File; You can use the up and down arrow at the command line, to access the previous and next command. The commands are recorded in the history file $HOME/.root_hist. It is a text file, and you can edit, cut, and paste from it. You can specify the history file in the system.rootrc file, by setting the Rint.Historyoption. You can also turn off the command logging in the system.rootrc file with the option: Rint.History: -; The number of history lines to be kept can be set also in .rootrc by:; Rint.HistSize: 500; Rint.HistSave: 400; The first value defines the maximum of lines kept; once it is reached all, the last HistSave lines will be removed. One can set HistSize to 0 to disable history line management. There is also implemented an environment variable called ROOT_HIST. By setting ROOT_HIST=300:200 the above values can be overriden - the first value corresponds to HistSize, the (optional) second one to HistSave. You can set ROOT_HIST=0 to disable the history.; 2.7.3 Tracking Memory Leaks; You can track memory usage and detect leaks by monitoring the number of objects that are created and deleted (see TObjectTable).

In case of divisions, binomial errors are also supported.; 3.7 Projections; One can make:. a 1-D projection of a 2-D histogram or profile. See TH2::ProfileX, TH2::ProfileY,TProfile::ProjectionX, TProfile2D::ProjectionXY, TH2::ProjectionX, TH2::ProjectionY .; a 1-D, 2-D or profile out of a 3-D histogram see TH3::ProjectionZ, TH3::Project3D. These projections can be fit via: TH2::FitSlicesX, TH2::FitSlicesY, TH3::FitSlicesZ.; 3.8 Drawing Histograms; When you call the Draw method of a histogram ( TH1::Draw ) for the first time, it creates a THistPainter object and saves a pointer to painter as a data member of the histogram. The THistPainter class specializes in the drawing of histograms. It allows logarithmic axes (x, y, z) when the CONT drawing option is using. The THistPainter class is separated from the histogram so that one can have histograms without the graphics overhead, for example in a batch program. The choice to give each histogram has its own painter rather than a central singleton painter, allows two histograms to be drawn in two threads without overwriting the painter’s values. When a displayed histogram is filled again, you do not have to call the Draw method again. The image is refreshed the next time the pad is updated. A pad is updated after one of these three actions:. A carriage control on the ROOT command line; A click inside the pad; A call to TPad::Update(). By default, the TH1::Draw clears the pad before drawing the new image of the histogram. You can use the ""SAME"" option to leave the previous display intact and superimpose the new histogram. The same histogram can be drawn with different graphics options in different pads.

It is very difficult to understand the overall shape of data. “n(nx,ny)” allows to change the density of displayed channels. Only the channels coinciding with given nodes are displayed.; The visualization “Angles” can be changed with “a(alpha,beta,view)”: “alpha” is the angle between the bottom horizontal screen line and the displayed space on the right side of the picture and “beta” on the left side, respectively. One can rotate the 3-d space around the vertical axis using the “view” parameter. Allowed values are 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees.; h2->Draw(""SPEC n(40,40) dm(0,1) a(30,30,0)"");; The operator “zs(scale)” changes the scale of the Z-axis. The possible values are:. 0 = Linear (default),; 1 = Log,; 2 = Sqrt. If gPad->SetLogz() has been set, the log scale on Z-axis is set automatically, i.e. there is no need for using the zs() operator. Note that the X and Y axis are always linear.; The operator “ci(r,g,b)” defines the colors increments (r, g and b are floats). For sophisticated shading (Light, Height and LightHeight Display Modes Groups) the color palette starts from the basic pen color (see pa() function). There is a predefined number of color levels (256). Color in every level is calculated by adding the increments of the r , g , b components to the previous level. Using this function one can change the color increments between two neighboring color levels. The function does not apply on the Simple Display Modes Group. The default values are: (1,1,1).; The operator “ca(color_algorithm)” allows to choose the Color Algorithm. To define the colors one can use one of the following color algorithms (RGB, CMY, CIE, YIQ, HVS models).

Bin the KS distances in a histogram, and then take the integral of all the KS values above the value obtained from the original data to Monte Carlo distribution. The number of pseudo-experiments NEXPT is currently fixed at 1000. The function returns the integral.

Excessive numerical round off - be especially careful of exponential and factorial functions which get big very quickly and lose accuracy.; Starting too far from the solution - the function may have unphysical local minima, especially at infinity in some variables. 5.10 Minuit2 Package; Minuit2 is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of the popular MINUIT minimization package. Compared with the TMinuit class, which is a direct conversion from FORTRAN to C++, Minuit2 is a complete redesign and re-implementation of the package. This new version provides all the functionality present in the old FORTRAN version, with almost equivalent numerical accuracy and computational performances. Furthermore, it contains some fixes and small improvements and this new functionality: * The possibility to set single side parameter limits * the FUMILI algorithm (see the next paragraph “FUMILI Minimization Package”), which is an optimized method for least square and log likelihood minimizations.; Minuit2 has been originally developed by M. Winkler and F. James in the SEAL project. More information can be found on the MINUIT Web Site and in particular at the following documentation page at http://www.cern.ch/minuit/doc/doc.html.; A detailed User Guide for Minuit2 exists, describing the API of the internal classes. ROOT uses Minuit2 for fitting via the Minuit2Minimizer class which implements the ROOT::Math::Minimizer interface.; Minuit2 is also distributed as an independent package of ROOT and can be built without any other dependency on the ROOT libraries.; Examples on how to use the Minuit2 and Fumili2 plug-ins are provided in the tutorials’ directory $ROOTSYS/tutorials/fit: minuit2FitBench.C, minuit2FitBench2D.C and minuit2GausFit.C.

The lengths of parallelepiped sides along i-th axis is \(2b_i\), where \(b_i\) is such a value that the functions \(f_j(\vec\theta)\) are quasi-linear all over the parallelepiped.; FUMILI takes into account simple linear inequalities in the form:; \[ \theta_i^{min}\le\theta_i\le\theta^{max}_i\]; They form parallelepiped \(P\) (\(P_0\) may be deformed by \(P\)).

See the image of the Object Browser in the next figure. The ROOT Object Browser. 8.3 Ownership by Other Objects; When an object creates another, the creating object is the owner of the created one. For example:; myHisto->Fit(""gaus""); The call to Fit copies the global TF1 Gaussian function and attaches the copy to the histogram. When the histogram is deleted, the copy is deleted also.; When a pad is deleted or cleared, all objects in the pad with the kCanDelete bit set are deleted automatically. Currently the objects created by the DrawCopy methods, have the kCanDelete bit set and are therefore owned by the pad.; 8.4 Ownership by the User; The user owns all objects not described in one of the above cases. TObject has two bits, kCanDelete and kMustCleanup, that influence how an object is managed (in TObject::fBits). These are in an enumeration in TObject.h. To set these bits do:; MyObject->SetBit(kCanDelete); MyObject->SetBit(kMustCleanup); The bits can be reset and tested with the TObject::ResetBit and TObject::TestBit methods.; 8.4.1 The kCanDelete Bit; The gROOT collections (see above) own their members and will delete them regardless of the kCanDelete bit. In all other collections, when the collection Clear method is called (i.e. TList::Clear()), members with the kCanDelete bit set, are deleted and removed from the collection. If the kCanDelete bit is not set, the object is only removed from the collection but not deleted.; If a collection Delete (TList::Delete()) method is called, all objects in the collection are deleted without considering the kCanDelete bit. It is important to realize that deleting the collection (i.e. delete MyCollection), DOES NOT delete the members of the collection.; If the user specified MyCollection->SetOwner() the collection owns the objects and delete MyCollection will delete all its members. Otherwise, you need to:; // delete all member objects in the collection; MyCollection->Delete();. //",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The subsequent divisions are the methods other parent classes in case of multiple inheritance. For example, see the TPaveText::title context menu. A TPaveText inherits from TAttLine, which has the method SetLineAttributes().; 9.2.3.3 Adding Context Menus for a Class; For a method to appear in the context menu of the object it has to be marked by // *MENU* in the header file. Below is the line from TAttLine.h that adds the SetLineAttribute method to the context menu.; virtual void SetLineAttributes(); // *MENU*; Nothing else is needed, since Cling knows the classes and their methods. It takes advantage of that to create the context menu on the fly when the object is clicking on. If you click on an axis, ROOT will ask the interpreter what are the methods of the TAxis and which ones are set for being displayed in a context menu.; Now, how does the interpreter know this? Remember, when you build a class that you want to use in the ROOT environment, you use rootcling that builds the so-called stub functions and the dictionary. These functions and the dictionary contain the knowledge of the used classes. To do this, rootcling parses all the header files. ROOT has defined some special syntax to inform Cling of certain things, this is done in the comments so that the code still compiles with a C++ compiler.; For example, you have a class with a Draw() method, which will display itself. You would like a context menu to appear when on clicks on the image of an object of this class. The recipe is the following:. The class has to contain the ClassDef/ClassImp macros; For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a comment after the declaration containing *MENU* or *TOGGLE* depending on the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods (setters). The *TOGGLE* comment is used to toggle a boolean data field. In that case, it is safe to call the data field fMyBool where MyBool is the name of the setter",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This function is defined as:; void Range(float x1,float y1,float x2,float y2); The arguments x1, x2 defines the new range in the x direction, and the y1, y2 define the new range in the y-direction.; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas (""MyCanvas""); root[] gPad->Range(-100,-100,100,100); This will set the active pad to have both coordinates to go from -100 to 100, with the center of the pad at (0,0). You can visually check the coordinates by viewing the status bar in the canvas. To display the status bar select Event Status entry in the View canvas menu. The status bar. 9.3.2.2 The Normalized Coordinate System (NDC); Normalized coordinates are independent of the window size and of the user system. The coordinates range from 0 to 1 and (0, 0) corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the pad. Several internal ROOT functions use the NDC system (3D primitives, PostScript, log scale mapping to linear scale). You may want to use this system if the user coordinates are not known ahead of time.; 9.3.2.3 The Pixel Coordinate System; The least common is the pixel coordinate system, used by functions such as DistancetoPrimitive() and ExecuteEvent(). Its primary use is for cursor position, which is always given in pixel coordinates. If (px,py) is the cursor position, px=0 and py=0 corresponds to the top-left corner of the pad, which is the standard convention in windowing systems.; 9.3.2.4 Using NDC for a particular Object; Most of the time, you will be using the user coordinate system. But sometimes, you will want to use NDC. For example, if you want to draw text always at the same place over a histogram, no matter what the histogram coordinates are. There are two ways to do this. You can set the NDC for one object or may convert NDC to user coordinates. Most graphical objects offer an option to be drawn in NDC.

A special set of styles allows handling of various levels of transparency. These are styles number 4000 to 4100, 4000 being fully transparent and 4100 fully opaque. So, suppose you have an existing canvas with several pads. You create a new pad (transparent) covering for example the entire canvas. Then you draw your primitives in this pad. The same can be achieved with the graphics editor. For example:; root[] .x tutorials/hist/h1draw.C; root[] TPad *newpad=new TPad(""newpad"",""Transparent pad"",0,0,1,1);; root[] newpad->SetFillStyle(4000);; root[] newpad->Draw();; root[] newpad->cd();; root[] // create some primitives, etc; 9.3.7 Setting the Log Scale; Setting the scale to logarithmic or linear is an attribute of the pad, not the axis or the histogram. The scale is an attribute of the pad because you may want to draw the same histogram in linear scale in one pad and in log scale in another pad. Frequently, we see several histograms on top of each other in the same pad. It would be very inconvenient to set the scale attribute for each histogram in a pad.; Furthermore, if the logic was set in the histogram class (or each object) the scale setting in each Paint method of all objects should be tested.; If you have a pad with a histogram, a right-click on the pad, outside of the histograms frame will convince you. The SetLogx(), SetLogy() and SetLogz() methods are there. As you see, TPad defines log scale for the two directions x and y plus z if you want to draw a 3D representation of some function or histogram.; The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:; root[] gPad->SetLogx(1); To reset log in the z direction:; root[] gPad->SetLogz(0); If you have a",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This may be useful to draw for example a supplementary axis for a graph. In this case, one has to use the TGaxis class, the graphical representation of an axis. One may use the standard constructor for this kind of objects:; TGaxis(Double_t xmin, Double_t ymin, Double_t xmax, Double_t ymax,; Double_t wmin, Double_t wmax, Int_t ndiv = 510,; Option_t* chopt,Double_t gridlength = 0); The arguments xmin, ymin are the coordinates of the axis’ start in the user coordinates system, and xmax, ymax are the end coordinates. The arguments wmin and wmax are the minimum (at the start) and maximum (at the end) values to be represented on the axis; ndiv is the number of divisions. The options, given by the “chopt” string are the following:. chopt = 'G': logarithmic scale, default is linear.; chopt = 'B': Blank axis (it is useful to superpose the axis). Instead of the wmin,wmax arguments of the normal constructor, i.e. the limits of the axis, the name of a TF1 function can be specified. This function will be used to map the user coordinates to the axis values and ticks.; The constructor is the following:; TGaxis(Double_t xmin, Double_t ymin, Double_t xmax, Double_t ymax,; const char* funcname, Int_t ndiv=510,; Option_t* chopt, Double_t gridlength=0); In such a way, it is possible to obtain exponential evolution of the tick marks position, or even decreasing. In fact, anything you like.; 9.5.6 Orientation of Tick Marks on Axis; Tick marks are normally drawn on the positive side of the axis, however, if xmin = xmax, then negative. chopt = '+': tick marks are drawn on Positive side. (Default); chopt = '-': tick marks are drawn on the negative side.; chopt = '+-': tick marks are drawn on both sides of the axis.; chopt = ‘U': unlabeled axis, default is",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

If a time axis has no specified time offset, the global time offset will be stored in the axis data structure. The histogram limits are in seconds. If wmin and wmax are the histogram limits, the time axis will spread around the time offset value from TimeOffset+wmin to TimeOffset+wmax. Until now all examples had a lowest value equal to 0. The following example demonstrates how to define the histogram limits relatively to the time offset value. Time axis examples. {; // Define the time offset as 2003, January 1st; TDatime T0(2003,01,01,00,00,00);; int X0 = T0.Convert();; gStyle->SetTimeOffset(X0);. // Define the lowest histogram limit as 2002,September 23rd; TDatime T1(2002,09,23,00,00,00);; int X1 = T1.Convert()-X0;. // Define the highest histogram limit as 2003, March 7th; TDatime T2(2003,03,07,00,00,00);; int X2 = T2.Convert(1)-X0;. TH1F * h1 = new TH1F(""h1"",""test"",100,X1,X2);. TRandom r;; for (Int_t i=0;i<30000;i++) {; Double_t noise = r.Gaus(0.5*(X1+X2),0.1*(X2-X1));; h1->Fill(noise);; }. h1->GetXaxis()->SetTimeDisplay(1);; h1->GetXaxis()->SetLabelSize(0.03);; h1->GetXaxis()->SetTimeFormat(""%Y/%m/%d"");; h1->Draw();; }; The output is shown in the next figure. Usually time axes are created automatically via histograms, but one may also want to draw a time axis outside a “histogram context”. Therefore, it is useful to understand how TGaxis works for such axis. The time offset can be defined using one of the three methods described before. The time axis will spread around the time offset value. Actually, it will go from TimeOffset+wmin to TimeOffset+wmax where wmin and wmax are the minimum and maximum values (in seconds) of the axis. Let us take again an example. Having defined “2003, February 28 at 12h”, we would like to see the axis a day before and a day after. A histogram with time axis X.

To cope with these variations the TBuffer3D objects are filled by negotiation with the viewer. TBuffer3D class hierarchy. TBuffer3D classes are conceptually divided into enumerated sections: kCore, kBoundingBox, kRaw - see the class diagram and the file TBuffer3D.h for more details. The TBuffer3D methods SectionsValid(), SetSectionsValid(), ClearSectionsValid() are used to test, set, clear these section validity flags e.g.; buffer.SetSectionsValid(TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific);; ...; if (buffer.SectionsValid(TBuffer3D:: kShapeSpecific)) {; ...; }; The sections found in the base TBuffer3D (kCore/kBoundingBox/kRawSizes/kRaw) are sufficient to describe any tessellated shape in a generic fashion. An additional kShapeSpecific section is added in TBuffer3D derived classes, allowing a more abstract shape description (“a sphere of inner radius x, outer radius y”). This enables a viewer, which knows how to draw (tessellate) the shape itself to do so, while providing a generic fallback suitable for all viewers. The rules for client negotiation with the viewer are:.

Add object as a single independent entity in the world reference frame - e.g. a sphere, radius r, at x, y, z.; Repeated placement (copying) in world frame of this locally unique piece of geometry (described in local reference frame) e.g. define a sphere S (radius r), place copy at x1, y1, z1, another copy at x2, y2, z2 etc. The second case is very typical in geometry packages, e.g. ROOT’s TGeo package, GEANT4 etc, where we have very large number repeated placements of relatively few unique “shapes”.; Some viewers (GL Viewer only at present) are able to take advantage of this by identifying unique logical shapes from the fID logical ID member of TBuffer3D. If repeated addition of the same fID is found, the shape is cached already - and the costly tessellation does not need to be sent again. The viewer can also perform internal GL specific caching (display lists) with considerable performance gains in these cases. For this to work correctly the logical object in must be described in TBuffer3D in the local reference frame, complete with the local/master translation. In some cases you will not have a real object you can reasonably set TBuffer3D::fID to, or the object is recycled or temporary.

Scene rebuilds will require destruction and recreation of all physical objects. For the second you can specify an identifier from the client side, which must be unique and stable - i.e. the IDs of a published object is consistent, regardless of changes in termination of contained child geometry branches.

For a more complex example, which works in both master and local frames, and uses logical/physical division of shape geometry and placement, examine the code under $ROOTSYS/geom - in particular TGeoShape hierarchy, and the painter object TGeoPainter (under geopainter) where the negotiation with the viewer is performed.; 10 Folders and Tasks; 10.1 Folders. A TFolder is a collection of objects visible and expandable in the ROOT object browser. Folders have a name and a title and are identified in the folder hierarchy by an “UNIX-like” naming convention. The base of all folders is //root. It is visible at the top of the left panel in the browser. The browser shows several folders under //root.; New folders can be added and removed to/from a folder.; 10.2 Why Use Folders?; One reason to use folders is to reduce class dependencies and improve modularity. Each set of data has a producer class and one or many consumer classes. When using folders, the producer class places a pointer to the data into a folder, and the consumer class retrieves a reference to the folder.; The consumer can access the objects in a folder by specifying the path name of the",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

At a breakpoint, data structures generated by the execution up this point may be inspected asynchronously and then the execution can be resumed by selecting the “Continue” function of a task.; A task may be active or inactive (controlled by TTask::SetActive). When a task is inactive, its sub tasks are not executed. A task tree may be made persistent, saving the status of all the tasks.; 11 Input/Output. This chapter covers the saving and reading of objects to and from ROOT files. It begins with an explanation of the physical layout of a ROOT file. It includes a discussion on compression, and file recovery. Then we explain the logical file, the class TFile and its methods. We show how to navigate in a file, how to save objects and read them back. We also include a discussion on Streamers. Streamers are the methods responsible to capture an objects current state to save it to disk or send it over the network. At the end of the chapter is a discussion on the two specialized ROOT files: TNetFile and TWebFile.; 11.1 The Physical Layout of ROOT Files; A ROOT file is like a UNIX file directory. It can contain directories and objects organized in unlimited number of levels. It also is stored in machine independent format (ASCII, IEEE floating point, Big Endian byte ordering). To look at the physical layout of a ROOT file, we first create one. This example creates a ROOT file and 15 histograms, fills each histogram with 1000 entries from a Gaussian distribution, and writes them to the file.; {; char name[10], title[20];; TObjArray Hlist(0); // create an array of Histograms; TH1F* h; // create a pointer to a histogram; // make an",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

ROOT tries to find the best free block. If a free block matches the size of the new object to be stored, the object is written in the free block and this free block is deleted from the list. If not, the first free block bigger than the object is used. TFile::fListHead contains a sorted list (TSortedList) of objects in memory. The diagram below illustrates the logical view of the TFile and TKey. ROOT File/Directory/Key description. 11.2.1 Viewing the Logical File Contents; TFile is a descendent of TDirectory, which means it behaves like a TDirectory. We can list the contents, print the name, and create subdirectories. In a ROOT session, you are always in a directory and the directory you are in is called the current directory and is stored in the global variable gDirectory. Let us look at a more detailed example of a ROOT file and its role as the current directory. First, we create a ROOT file by executing a sample script.; root[] .x $ROOTSYS/tutorials/hsimple.C; Now you should have hsimple.root in your directory. The file was closed by the script so we have to open it again to work with it. We open the file with the intent to update it, and list its contents.; root[] TFile f (""hsimple.root"",""UPDATE""); root[] f.ls(); TFile** hsimple.root; TFile* hsimple.root; KEY: TH1F hpx;1 This is the px distribution; KEY: TH2F hpxpy;1 py vs px; KEY: TProf",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

They in turn move up their own inheritance tree and so forth. The simple data members are written to the buffer directly. Eventually the buffer contains all simple data members of all the classes that make up this particular object. Data members that are references (as MyClass &fObj;) are never saved, it is always the responsibility of the object’s constructor to set them properly.; 11.3.1 Automatically Generated Streamers; A Streamerusually calls other Streamers: the Streamerof its parents and data members. This architecture depends on all classes having Streamers, because eventually they will be called. To ensure that a class has a Streamer, rootcling automatically creates one in the ClassDef macro that is defined in $ROOTSYS/include/Rtypes.h. ClassDef defines several methods for any class, and one of them is the Streamer. The automatically generated Streameris complete and can be used as long as no customization is needed.; The Event class is defined in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.h.

WriteBuffer writes the current version number of the Event class, and its contents into the buffer R__b. The Streamercalls TClass::ReadBuffer when reading an Event object. The ReadBuffer method reads the information from buffer R__b into the Event object.; 11.3.2 Transient Data Members (//!); To prevent a data member from being written to the file, insert a “!” as the first character after the comment marks.

However if you want to write your own Streameryou can do so. For some classes, it may be necessary to execute some code before or after the read or write block in the automatic Streamer. For example after the execution of the read block, one can initialize some non persistent members. There are two reasons why you would need to write your own Streamer: 1) if you have a non-persistent data member that you want to initialize to a value depending on the read data members; 2) if you want or need to handle the schema evolution on your own. Note that an alternative for those cases is to consider write a schema evolution rule.; First, you need to tell rootcling not to build a Streamerfor you. The input to the rootcling command (in the makefile) is a list of classes in a LinkDef.h file. For example, the list of classes for Event is listed in $ROOTSYS/test/EventLinkDef.h. The “-” at the end of the class name tells rootcling not to generate a Streamer. In the example, you can see the Event class is the only one for which rootcling is instructed not to generate a Streamer.; #ifdef __ROOTCLING__. #pragma link off all globals;; #pragma link off all classes;; #pragma link off all functions;; #pragma link C++ class EventHeader+;; #pragma link C++ class Event-;; #pragma link C++ class HistogramManager+;; #pragma link C++ class Track+;. #endif; #pragma link C++ class EventHeader+;; The “+” sign tells rootcling to use the new Streamersystem introduced in ROOT 3.0. The following is an example of a customized Streamerfor Event. The Streamer takes a TBuffer as a parameter, and first checks to see if this is a case of reading or writing the buffer.; void Event::Streamer(TBuffer &R__b) {; if (R__b.IsReading()) {; Event::Class()->ReadBuffer(R__b, this);; fTransient = gDirectory; //save current directory; fPt= TMath::Sqrt(fP",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

In addition, if the pointer is read before the referenced object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address these limitations, ROOT offers the TRef class.; TRef allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in a different file. TRef also supports the complex situation where a TFile is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different machine. When a TRef is read before its referenced object, it is null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the TRef points to it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by TRef in the case it is read before its reference object (see“Action on Demand” below).; 11.4.3 Using TRef; A TRef is a lightweight object pointing to any TObject. This object can be used instead of normal C++ pointers in case:. The referenced object R and the pointer P are not written to the same file; P is read before R; R and P are written to different Tree branches. Below is a line from the example in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx.; TRef fLastTrack; //pointer to last track; ...; Track *track = (Track*)fTracks->ConstructedAt(fNtrack++);; track->Set(random);; // Save reference to last Track in the collection of Tracks; fLastTrack = track;; The track and its reference fLastTrack can be written with two separate I/O calls in the same or in different files, in the same or in different branches of a TTree. If the TRef is read and the referenced object has not yet been read, TRef will return a null pointer. As soon as the referenced object will be read, TRef will point to it.; 11.4.4 How Does It Work?; A TRef is itself a TObject with an additional transient pointer fPID. When a TRef is used to point to a TObject*R, for example in a class with; TRef P;; one can do:; P = R; //to set the pointer; When the statement P = Ris executed, the following happens:. The pointer fPID is set to the current TProcessID (see below).; The current ObjectNumber (see below) is incremented by one.; R.fUniqueID",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

In the same way, when a TRef::GetObject is called, GetObject uses its own fUniqueID to find the pointer to the referenced object. See TProcessID::GetObjectWithID and PutObjectWithID.; 11.4.4.2 Object Number; When an object is referenced, a unique identifier is computed and stored in both the fUniqueID of the referenced and referencing object. This uniqueID is computed by incrementing by one the static global in TProcessID::fgNumber. The fUniqueID is the serial object number in the current session. One can retrieve the current fgNumber value by calling the static function TProcessID::GetObjectCount at any time or can set this number by TProcessID::SetObjectCount. To avoid a growing table of fObjects in TProcessID, in case, for example, one processes many events in a loop, it might be necessary to reset the object number at the end of processing of one event. See an example in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx (look at function Build). The value of ObjectNumbermay be saved at the beginning of one event and reset to this original value at the end of the event. These actions may be nested.; saveNumber = TProcessID::GetObjectCount();; ...; TProcessID::SetObjectCount(savedNumber);; 11.4.5 Action on Demand; The normal behavior of a TRef has been described above. In addition, TRef supports “Actions on Demand”. It may happen that the referenced object is not yet in the memory, on a separate file or not yet computed. In this case, TRef is able to execute automatically an action:.

One can compute a pointer to an existing TExec with a name with:; TExec *myExec = gROOT->GetExec(execName);; myExec->SetAction(actionCommand);; The parameter actionCommand is a string containing a Cling instruction. Examples:; myExec->SetAction(""LoadHits()"");; myExec->SetAction("".x script.C"");; When a TRef is de-referenced via TRef::GetObject, its TExec** is automatically executed. The TExec function/script can do one or more of the following:**. Load a file containing the referenced object. This function typically looks in the file catalog.; Compute a pointer to the referenced object and communicate this pointer back to the calling function TRef::SetObject via:. TRef::SetObject(object); As soon as an object is returned to GetObject, the fUniqueID of the TRef is set to the fUniqueID of the referenced object. At the next call to GetObject, the pointer stored in fPid:fObjects[fUniqueID] will be returned directly. An example of action on demand is in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.h:; TRef fWebHistogram; //EXEC:GetWebHistogram; When calling fWebHistogram.GetObject(), the function GetObject will automatically invoke the script GetWebHistogram.C via the interpreter. An example of a GetWebHistogram.C script is shown below:; void GetWebHistogram() {; TFile *f=TFile::Open(""http://root.cern.ch/files/pippa.root"");; f->cd(""DM/CJ"");; TH1 *h6 = (TH1*)gDirectory->Get(""h6"");; h6->SetDirectory(0);; delete f;; TRef::SetObject(h6);; }; In the above example, a call to fWebHistogram.GetObject() executes the script with the function GetWebHistogram.

Objects of the TSchemaRule class represent the rules and their fields have exactly the same meaning as the ones of rules specified in the dictionaries. TSchemaRuleSet objects manage the sets of rules and ensure their consistency. There can be no conflicting rules in the rule sets. The rule sets are owned by the TClass objects corresponding to the target classes defined in the rules and can be accessed using TClass::{Get|Adopt}SchemaRules.; 11.5.7 Manual Schema Evolution; If you have written your own Streamer as described in the section “Streamers with Special Additions”, you will have to manually add code for each version and manage the evolution of your class. When you add or remove data members, you must modify the Streamer by hand. ROOT assumes that you have increased the class version number in the ClassDef statement and introduced the relevant test in the read part of the Streamer. For example, if a new version of the Event class above includes a new member: Int_t fNew the ClassDef statement should be changed to ClassDef(Event,2) and the following lines should be added to the read part of the Streamer:; if (R__v > 1) R__b >> fNew;; else fNew = 0; // set to some default value; If, in the same new version 2 you remove the member fH, you must add the following code to read the histogram object into some temporary object and delete it:; if (R__v) < 2 {; TH1F *dummy = 0;; R__b >> dummy;; delete dummy;; }; Our experience with manual schema evolution shows that it is easy to make and mismatches between Streamer writers and readers are frequent and increase as the number of classes increase. We recommend you use rootcling generated Streamers whenever you can, and profit from the automatic schema evolution.; 11.5.8 Building Class Definitions with the StreamerInfo; A ROOT file’s StreamerInfolist ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Consequently, a ROOT file may contain objects with different compression levels. This table shows four runs of the demo script that creates 15 histograms with different compression parameters. To make the numbers more significant, the macro was modified to create 1000 histograms. We have included two more examples to show the impact of compression on Trees in the next chapter.; 11.6.1 Using the General Open Function of TFile; To make life simple we provide a general function to open any type of file (except shared memory files of class TMapFile). This functionality is provided by the static TFile::Open() function:; TFile *TFile::Open(const Text_t *name,Option_t *option="""",; const Text_t *title="""",Int_t compress,Int_t netopt); Depending on the name argument, the function returns a TFile or one of its derivations, for example a TNetXNGFile or a TDavixFile object. In case a URL specifies a local file, a TFile object will be returned (and of course no login information is needed). The arguments of the Open() function are the same as the ones for the TFile constructor.; Using ReOpen() method it is possible to reopen a file with a different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE, RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either “READ” or “UPDATE”. The method returns:. 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;; 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or there were wrong input arguments);; -1 in case of failure. In the last case the file cannot be used anymore. 11.7 Remotely Access to ROOT Files; ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols ‘root://’ and ‘xrd://’) and a Web server (protocl ‘http://’ or ‘https://’).; The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00.; Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a d",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The XML file is built in memory before being dumped to disk. Like for normal ROOT files, XML files use the same I/O mechanism exploiting the ROOT/Cling dictionary. Any class having a dictionary can be saved in XML format. This first implementation does not support subdirectories or trees.; The shared library libRXML.so may be loaded dynamically via gSystem->Load(""libRXML""). This library is also automatically loaded by the plug-in manager as soon a XML file is created. To create an XTM file, simply specify a filename with an .xml extension when calling TFile::Open. TFile::Open will recognize that you are trying to open an XML file and return a TXMLFile object. When a XML file is open in write mode, one can use the normal TObject::Write to write an object in the file.; // example of a session saving a histogram to a XML file; TFile *f = TFile::Open(""Example.xml"",""recreate"");; TH1F *h = new TH1F(""h"",""test"",1000,-2,2); h->FillRandom(""gaus"");; h->Write();; delete f;; // example of a session saving a histogram to a XML file; TFile *f = TFile::Open(""Example.xml"");; TH1F *h = (TH1F*)f->Get(""h"");; h->Draw();; The canvas can be saved as a XML file format via File menu / Save or Save As menu entries. One can do also:; canvas->Print(""Example.xml"");; 12 Trees; 12.1 Why Should You Use a Tree?; In the “Input/Output” chapter, we saw how objects can be saved in ROOT files. In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects, ROOT has designed the TTree and TNtuple classes specifically for that purpose. The TTree class is optimized to reduce disk space and enhance access speed. A TNtuple is a TTree that is limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a TTree on the other hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to all the simple types.; When using a TTree, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and leafs, are explained a little later in ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

If the acquisition fails to complete, you can recover the file and all the contents since the last Autosave. To set the number of bytes between Autosave you can use the TTree::SetAutosave() method. You can also call TTree::Autosave in the acquisition loop every nentry.; 12.7.4 Trees with Circular Buffers; When a TTree is memory resident, you set it up so that it retains retain only the last few entries. For example, this can be very useful for monitoring purpose.; void TTree::SetCircular(Long64_t maxEntries);; where maxEntries is the maximum number of entries to be kept in the buffers. When the number of entries exceeds this value, the first entries in the Tree are deleted and the buffers used again. An example of a script using a circular buffer is shown below:; void circular() {; gROOT->cd(); //make sure that the Tree is memory resident; TTree *T = new TTree(""T"",""test circular buffers"");; TRandom r;; Float_t px,py,pz;; Double_t random;; UShort_t i;; T->Branch(""px"",&px,""px/F"");; T->Branch(""py"",&py,""py/F"");; T->Branch(""pz"",&pz,""pz/F"");; T->Branch(""random"",&random,""random/D"");; T->Branch(""i"",&i,""i/s"");; T->SetCircular(20000);; for (i = 0; i < 65000; i++) {; r.Rannor(px,py);; pz = px*px + py*py;; random = r.Rndm();; T->Fill();; }; T->Print();; }; 12.7.5 Size of TTree in the File; When writing a TTree to a file, if the file size reaches the value stored in the TTree::GetMaxTreeSize(), the current file is closed and a new file is created. If the original file is named “myfile.root”, subsequent files are named “myfile_1.root”, “myfile_2.root”, etc.; Currently, the automatic change of file is restricted to the case where the tree is in the top level directory. The file should not contain sub-directories. Before switching to a new file, the tree header is written to the current file, then the current file is closed.

If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches. If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates on it. A variable on a TBranch is called a leaf (yes - TLeaf). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that branches of the same TTree can be written to separate files. To add a TBranch to a TTree we call the method TTree::Branch(). Note that we DO NOT use the TBranch constructor.; The TTree::Branch method has several signatures. The branch type differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a TList, or an array of objects. Let’s see some examples. To follow along you will need the shared library libEvent.so. First, check if it is in $ROOTSYS/test. If it is, copy it to your own area.

In the code above, “event” is a structure with one float and three integers and one unsigned integer. You should not assume that the compiler aligns the elements of a structure without gaps.

Each example has a named script in the $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree directory. They are called tree1.C to tree4.C. The examples are:. tree1.C: a tree with several simple (integers and floating point) variables.; tree2.C: a tree built from a C structure (struct). This example uses the Geant3 C wrapper as an example of a FORTRAN common block ported to C with a C structure.; tree3.C: in this example, we will show how to extend a tree with a branch from another tree with the Friends feature. These trees have branches with variable length arrays. Each entry has a variable number of tracks, and each track has several variables.; tree4.C: a tree with a class (Event). The class Event is defined in $ROOTSYS/test. In this example we first encounter the impact of splitting a branch. Each script contains the main function, with the same name as the file (i.e. tree1), the function to write - tree1w, and the function to read - tree1r. If the script is not run in batch mode, it displays the tree in the browser and tree viewer. To study the example scripts, you can either execute the main script, or load the script and execute a specific function. For example:; // execute the function that writes, reads, shows the tree; root[] x tree1.C; // use ACLiC to build shared library, check syntax, execute; root[] x tree1.C++; // Load the script and select a function to execute; root[] L tree1.C; root[] tree1w(); root[] tree1r(); 12.14 Example 1: A Tree with Simple Variables; This example shows how to write, view, and read a tree with several simple (integers and floating-point) variables.; 12.14.1 Writing the Tree; Below is the function that writes the tree (tree1w).

We first define the variables to hold the read values.; Float_t px, py, pz;; Then we tell the tree to populate these variables when reading an entry. We do this with the method TTree::SetBranchAddress. The first parameter is the branch name, and the second is the address of the variable where the branch data is to be placed. In this example, the branch name is px. This name was given when the tree was written (see tree1w). The second parameter is the address of the variable px.; t1->SetBranchAddress(""px"",&px);; 12.14.3.1 GetEntry; Once the branches have been given the address, a specific entry can be read into the variables with the method TTree::GetEntry(n).

A TBranch object is created for each variable in the expression. The total number of rows read from the file is returned.; 12.19 Trees in Analysis; The methods TTree::Draw, TTree::MakeClass and TTree::MakeSelector are available for data analysis using trees. The TTree::Draw method is a powerful yet simple way to look and draw the trees contents. It enables you to plot a variable (a leaf) with just one line of code. However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your analysis. For these cases, you can use TTree::MakeClass. It creates a class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand it to do the logic of your analysis.; The TTree::MakeSelector is the recommended method for ROOT data analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor. With MakeClass the user has control over the event loop, with MakeSelectorthe tree is in control of the event loop.; 12.20 Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw; We will use the tree in cernstaff.root that was made by the macro in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/staff.C.; First, open the file and lists its contents.; root[] TFile f (""cernstaff.root""); root[] f.ls(); TFile** cernstaff.root; TFile* cernstaff.root; KEY: TTree T;1 staff data from ascii file; We can see the TTree“T” in the file. We will use it to experiment with the TTree::Draw method, so let’s create a pointer to it:; root[] TTree *MyTree = T; Cling allows us to get simply the object by using it. Here we define a pointer to a TTree ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html
https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html:588799,Testability,log,logical,588799,"t *(boolean expression)""; If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, the histogram is filled with a weight. If the weight is not explicitly specified it is assumed to be 1.; For example, this selection will add 1 to the histogram if x is less than y and the square root of z is less than 3.2.; ""x<y && sqrt(z)>3.2""; On the other hand, this selection will add x+y to the histogram if the square root of z is larger than 3.2.; ""(x+y)*(sqrt(z)>3.2)""; The Draw method has its own parser, and it only looks in the current tree for variables. This means that any variable used in the selection must be defined in the tree. You cannot use an arbitrary global variable in the TTree::Draw method.; 12.20.2 Using TCut Objects in TTree::Draw; The TTree::Draw method also accepts TCutG objects. A TCut is a specialized string object used for TTree selections. A TCut object has a name and a title. It does not have any data members in addition to what it inherits from TNamed. It only adds a set of operators to do logical string concatenation. For example, assume:; TCut cut1 = ""x<1""; TCut cut2 = ""y>2""; then; cut1 && cut2; //result is the string ""(x<1)&&(y>2)""; Operators =, +=, +, *, !, &&, || are overloaded, here are some examples:; root[] TCut c1 = ""x < 1""; root[] TCut c2 = ""y < 0""; root[] TCut c3 = c1 && c2; root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 || ""x>0""); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 && c2); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", ""(x + y)"" * (c1 && c2)); 12.20.3 Accessing the Histogram in Batch Mode; The TTree::Draw method creates a histogram called htemp and puts it on the active pad. In a batch program, the histogram htemp created by default, is reachable from the current pad.; // draw the histogram; nt->Draw(""x"", ""cuts"");; // get the histogram from the current pad; TH1F *htemp = (TH1F*)gPad->GetPrimitive(""htemp"");; // now we have full use of the histogram; htemp->GetEntries();; If you pipe the result of the TTree::Draw into a histogram, the histogram is also available in the current ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

It does not paint the object on the screen. However, TTree::Draw when called with option “same” gets the current pad coordinates to build an intermediate histogram with the right limits. Since nothing has been painted in the pad yet, the pad limits have not been computed. Calling pad->Update() forces the painting of the pad and allows TTree::Draw to compute the right limits for the intermediate histogram.; 12.20.6 Setting the Range in TTree::Draw; There are two more optional parameters to the TTree::Draw method: one is the number of entries and the second one is the entry to start with. For example, this command draws 1000 entries starting with entry 100:; myTree->Draw(""Cost:Age"", """","""",1000,100);; 12.20.7 TTree::Draw Examples; The examples below use the Event.root file generated by the $ROOTSYS/test/Event executable and the Event, Track, and EventHeader class definitions are in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.h.

Next figure shows the CPU time for these four operations as a function of the matrix size:. A*B The execution time is measured for the sum of A * Bsym, Bsym* A and A * B. Notice the matrix_size3 dependence of execution time. CLHEP results are hampered by a poor implementation of symmetric matrix multiplications. For instance, for general matrices of size 100x100, the time is 0.015 sec. while A * Bsym takes 0.028 sec and Bsym* A takes 0.059 sec. Both GSL and ROOT v4.0 can be setup to use the hardware-optimized multiplication routines of the BLAS libraries. It was tested on a G4 PowerPC. The improvement becomes clearly visible around sizes of (50x50) were the execution speed improvement of the Altivec processor becomes more significant than the overhead of filling its pipe. \(A^{-1}\) Here, the time is measured for an in-place matrix inversion. Except for ROOT v3.10, the algorithms are all based on an LUfactorization followed by forward/back-substitution. ROOT v3.10 is using the slower Gaussian elimination method. The numerical accuracy of the CLHEP routine is poor:. up to 6x6 the numerical imprecise Cramer multiplication is hard-coded. For instance, calculating U=H*H-1, where H is a (5x5) Hilbert matrix, results in off-diagonal elements of \(10^{-7}\) instead of the \(10^{-13}\) using an LUaccording to Crout.; scaling protection is non-existent and limits are hard-coded, as a consequence inversion of a Hilbert matrix for sizes>(12x12) fails.

Many, if not most, of the applications you write will use collections. If you have used parameterized C++ collections or polymorphic collections before, some of this material will be review. However, much of this chapter covers aspects of collections specific to the ROOT system. When you have read this chapter, you will know. How to create instances of collections; The difference between lists, arrays, hash tables, maps, etc.; How to add and remove elements of a collection; How to search a collection for a specific element; How to access and modify collection elements; How to iterate over a collection to access collection elements; How to manage memory for collections and collection elements; How collection elements are tested for equality (IsEqual()); How collection elements are compared (Compare()) in case of sorted collections; How collection elements are hashed (Hash()) in hash tables. 16.1 Understanding Collections; A collection is a group of related objects. You will find it easier to manage a large number of items as a collection. For example, a diagram editor might manage a collection of points and lines. A set of widgets for a graphical user interface can be placed in a collection. A geometrical model can be described by collections of shapes, materials and rotation matrices. Collections can themselves be placed in collections. Collections act as flexible alternatives to traditional data structures of computers science such as arrays, lists and trees.; 16.1.1 General Characteristics; The ROOT collections are polymorphic containers that hold pointers to TObjects, so:. They can only hold objects that inherit from TObject; They retu",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Object ownership is important when it comes to deleting objects; if nobody owns the object it could end up as wasted memory (i.e. a memory leak) when no longer needed. If a collection is deleted, its objects are not. The user can force a collection to delete its objects, but that is the user’s choice.; 16.1.2 Determining the Class of Contained Objects; Most containers may hold heterogeneous collections of objects and then it is left to the user to correctly cast the TObject pointer to the right class. Casting to the wrong class will give wrong results and may well crash the program! Therefore, the user has to be very careful. Often a container only contains one class of objects, but if it really contains a mixture, it is possible to ask each object about its class using the InheritsFrom method.; For example if myObject is a TObject pointer:; if (myObject->InheritsFrom(""TParticle"") {; printf(""myObject is a TParticlen"");; }; As the name suggests, this test works even if the object is a subclass of TParticle. The member function IsA() can be used instead of InheritsFrom to make the test exact. The InheritsFrom and IsA methods use the extensive Run Time Type Information (RTTI) available via the ROOT meta-classes.; 16.1.3 Types of Collections; The ROOT system implements the following basic types of collections: unordered collections, ordered collections and sorted collections. Next figure shows the inheritance hierarchy for the primary collection classes. All primary collection classes derive from the abstract base class TCollection. The inheritance hierarchy of the primary collection classes. 16.1.4 Ordered Collections (Sequences); Sequences are collections that are externally ordered because they maintain internal elements according to the order in which they were added. The following sequences are available:. TList; THashList; TOrdCollection; TObjArray; TClonesArray.

Often a container only contains one class of objects, but if it really contains a mixture, it is possible to ask each object about its class using the InheritsFrom method.; For example if myObject is a TObject pointer:; if (myObject->InheritsFrom(""TParticle"") {; printf(""myObject is a TParticlen"");; }; As the name suggests, this test works even if the object is a subclass of TParticle. The member function IsA() can be used instead of InheritsFrom to make the test exact. The InheritsFrom and IsA methods use the extensive Run Time Type Information (RTTI) available via the ROOT meta-classes.; 16.1.3 Types of Collections; The ROOT system implements the following basic types of collections: unordered collections, ordered collections and sorted collections. Next figure shows the inheritance hierarchy for the primary collection classes. All primary collection classes derive from the abstract base class TCollection. The inheritance hierarchy of the primary collection classes. 16.1.4 Ordered Collections (Sequences); Sequences are collections that are externally ordered because they maintain internal elements according to the order in which they were added. The following sequences are available:. TList; THashList; TOrdCollection; TObjArray; TClonesArray. The TOrdCollection, TObjArray as well as the TClonesArray can be sorted using their Sort() member function (for this, the stored objects must provide a comparison fun",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The Illegal overlaps folder is empty but can be filled after performing a geometry validity check (see section: “Checking the Geometry”). If tracking is performed using TGeo, the folder Tracks might contain user-defined tracks that can be visualized/animated in the geometry context (see section: “Creating and Visualizing Tracks”). Since for the time being we are interested more in the geometrical hierarchy, we will focus on the last two displayed items TOPand TOP_1. These are the top volume and the corresponding top node in the hierarchy.; Double clicking on the TOP volume will unfold all different volumes contained by the top volume. In the right panel, we will see all the volumes contained by TOP (if the same is positioned 4 times we will get 4 identical items). This rule will apply to any clicked volume in the hierarchy. Note that right clicking a volume item activates the volume context menu containing several specific methods. We will call the volume hierarchy developed in this way as the logical geometry graph. The volume objects are nodes inside this graph and the same volume can be accessed starting from different branches.; On the other hand, the real geometrical objects that are seen when visualizing or tracking the geometry are depicted in the TOP_1 branch. These are the nodes of the physical tree of positioned volumes represented by TGeoNode objects. This hierarchy is a tree since a node can have only one parent and several daughters. For a better understanding of the hierarchy, have a look at https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTGeoManager.html.; Just close now the X3D window and focus at the wire frame picture drawn in a pad. Activate Options/Event Status. Moving the mouse in the pad, you will notice that objects are sometimes changing color to red.

This looks much nicer, is it? In fact, it is and it is not. Of course, we managed to get rid of the ‘unnecessary’ volume C in our geometry, but we end-up with a more flat structure for D,E and F (more daughters inside). This can get much worse when extensively used, as in the case: assemblies of assemblies.; For deciding what to choose between using virtual containers or assemblies for a specific case, one can use for both cases, after the geometry was closed:; gGeoManager->SetTopVolume(ptr_D);; gGeoManager->Test();; gGeoManager->RestoreMasterVolume();; The ptr_D is a pointer to volume D containing the interesting structure.

It defines a global pointer gGeoManager in order to be fully accessible from external code. The manager class is the owner of all geometry objects defined in a session; therefore, users must not try to control their deletion. It contains lists of media, materials, transformations, shapes and volumes. A special case is the one of geometrical transformations. When creating a matrix or a translation, this is by default owned by external objects. The manager class becomes owner of all transformations used for positioning volumes. In order to force the ownership for other transformations, one can use TGeoMatrix::RegisterYourself() method. Do not be therefore surprised that some transformations cannot be found by name when creating a composite shape for instance if you did not register them after creation.; Logical nodes (positioned volumes) are created and destroyed by the TGeoVolume class. Physical nodes and their global transformations are subjected to a caching mechanism due to the sometimes very large memory requirements of logical graph expansion. The total number of physical instances of volumes triggers the caching mechanism and the cache manager is a client of TGeoManager. The manager class also controls the drawing/checking package (TGeoPainter client). This is linked with ROOT graphical libraries loaded on demand in order to control visualization actions.; 18.5 Navigation and Tracking; Tracking is the feature allowing the transport of a given particle knowing its kinematics.

Since a node is just a positioned volume, we can then get a pointer to the volume, medium or material objects related to it. Deepest means that B_3 still contains point P (as well as A_1 and TOP_1), but none of the daughters of volume B does. After finding out the node containing the particle, one can check if the geometry state is different compared to the last located point:; Bool_t *TGeoManager::IsSameLocation(); The algorithm for finding where a point is located in geometry is presented in the figure 17-36.; It always starts by checking if the last computed modeller state is the answer. This optimizes the search when continuously tracking a particle. The main actions performed are:. moving up and down in the logical node tree while updating the current node and its global matrix; converting the global position into the local frame of the current node/volume; checking whether the local position lies within the geometrical shape of the current volume - if this is the case continue the search downwards for the daughters of the current node, otherwise search upwards its containers until the top level is reached.; the number of candidate nodes to be checked at a given level is minimized by an additional optimization structure: voxels. This is effective even in case there is only one daughter of the current volume.; in case the current node is declared as possibly overlapping, the method FindInCluster() is invoked. This method checks all different possibilities within the cluster of overlapping candidates. One of the candidates is prioritized if one of the following conditions id fulfilled (in order):; Is declared as non-overlapping (these are anyway searched first); Has at least one daughter that contains the current point; Was already declared as containing the point at a previous step.

It is, of course, also possible (and preferable if you only use the function for plotting) to keep the parameters as data members of the callable instance and use and set them directly from Python.; 19.1.8.2 Fitting Histograms; Fitting a histogram with a Python function is no more difficult than plotting: instantiate a TF1 with the Python callable and supply that TF1 as a parameter to the Fit() member function of the histogram. After the fit, you can retrieve the fit parameters from the TF1 instance. For example:; from ROOT import TF1, TH1F, TCanvas. class Linear:; def __call__( self, x, par ):; return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]. # create a linear function for fitting; f = TF1('pyf3',Linear(),-1.,1.,2). # create and fill a histogram; h = TH1F('h','test',100,-1.,1.); f2 = TF1('cf2','6.+x*4.5',-1.,1.); h.FillRandom('cf2',10000). # fit the histo with the python 'linear' function; h.Fit(f). # print results; par = f.GetParameters(); print('fit results: const =', par[0], ',pitch =', par[1]); 19.1.9 Working with Trees; Next to making histograms, working with trees is probably the most common part of any analysis. The TTree implementation uses pointers and dedicated buffers to reduce the memory usage and to speed up access. Consequently, mapping TTree functionality to Python is not straightforward, and most of the following features are implemented in ROOT release 4.01/04 and later only, whereas you will need 5.02 if you require all of them.; 19.1.9.1 Accessing an Existing Tree; Let us assume that you have a file containing TTrees, TChains, or TNtuples and want to read the contents for use in your analysis code.

One can pass the address of an external mutex to the TCondition constructor:; TMutex MyMutex;; TCondition MyCondition(&MyMutex);; If zero is passed, TCondition creates and uses its own internal mutex:; TCondition MyCondition(0);; You can now use the following methods of synchronization:. TCondition::Wait() waits until any thread sends a signal of the same condition instance: MyCondition.Wait() reacts on MyCondition.Signal() or MyCondition.Broadcast(). MyOtherCondition.Signal() has no effect.; If several threads wait for the signal from the same TCondition MyCondition, at MyCondition.Signal() only one thread will react; to activate a further thread another MyCondition.Signal() is required, etc.; If several threads wait for the signal from the same TCondition MyCondition, at MyCondition.Broadcast() all threads waiting for MyCondition are activated at once. In some tests of MyCondition using an internal mutex, Broadcast() activated only one thread (probably depending whether MyCondition had been signaled before). MyCondition.TimedWait(secs,nanosecs) waits for MyCondition until the absolute time in seconds and nanoseconds since beginning of the epoch (January, 1st, 1970) is reached; to use relative timeouts ‘‘delta’‘, it is required to calculate the absolute time at the beginning of waiting ‘‘now’’; for example:. Ulong_t now,then,delta; // seconds; TDatime myTime; // root daytime class; myTime.Set(); // myTime set to ""now""; now=myTime.Convert(); // to seconds since 1970. Return value wait of MyCondition.TimedWait should be 0, if MyCondition.Signal() was received, and should be nonzero, if timeout was reached. The conditions example shows how three threaded functions are synchronized using TCondition: a ROOT script condstart.C starts the threads, which are defined in a shared library (conditions.cxx, conditions.h).; 23.2.4.3 Xlib Connections; Usually Xlib is not thread safe.

This call tells the Window Manager that it should not resize the window. The option kFixedSize works only for embedded frames like TGCompositeFrame and derived classes (in combination with layout hints).; The TGVerticalFrame and TGHorizontalFrame are composite frames that lay out their child frames in vertical or horizontal way in the same order as they were added and according to their hints preferences.; The TGTransientFrame class defines transient windows that typically are used for dialogs. They extend and complete an interaction within a limited context. Always transient frames are displayed from another window or another dialog. They may appear because of a command button being activated or a menu item being selected. They may also present automatically when an additional input and the user attention are required by a certain condition.; The TGGroupFrame class presents a very convenient frame which surrounds visually a group of logically connected widgets: radio buttons, related check boxes, two or more functionally related controls. It is a composite frame with a border and a title. The title explains the purpose of the group and should be a noun or noun phrase. Here is an example taken from guitest.C:; groupFrame = new TGGroupFrame(tf,""Options"",kVerticalFrame);; groupFrame->SetTitlePos(TGGroupFrame::kLeft);; The second line sets the title position on the left. You can change it to be centered or right aligned if you use TGGroupFrame::kCenter or TGGroupFrame::kRight as a parameter. Be conservative in the use of borders because of the potential for clutter. Do not place them around single entry fields, single combo boxes, list boxes and groups of command buttons. The design of these widgets provides them with a border.

You can assign a command directly as a parameter of the picture button constructor. The picture of TGPictureButton can be changed by:; fPicture->SetPicture(""h2_s.xpm"");; The advantage of command buttons is that they are always visible, providing a reminder of their existence. They can be inscribed with a meaningful description of what they do by TGToolTip(""Some describing text""). Their activation is much easier and faster than using a two-step menu bar/pull-down sequence. The only disadvantage of the text and picture buttons is that they consume considerable screen space if they are many. Having no more than six command buttons per window or dialog box helps to appropriately balance the application’s effectiveness, its real efficiency, and the operational simplicity.; The classes TGRadioButton and TGCheckButton present the option buttons in ROOT. Like the text buttons, they have text or hot string as a label. Radio buttons are grouped in logical sets of two or more and appear with a text label to the right. The choices are mutually exclusive and only one setting is permitted at one time. They represent visually all alternatives and it is easy to access and compare choices. They facilitate the situations where all alternatives cannot be easily remembered or where displaying the alternatives together helps to understand and select the proper choice. It is very useful to provide a default setting whenever it is possible. When it is not possible to establish a default setting because of the nature of the information, it is better to leave all radio buttons blank. A columnar orientation is the preferred manner of radio buttons presentation. If the vertical space on the window is limited, they can be oriented horizontally.

Popup menus can appear in a menu bar. They can be a sub-menu of another popup menu (cascading menus) or can be standalone (as a context menu). They are made of one or more menu items choices. When displayed, the menu items are arranged in a vertical list. Usually they correspond to actions (e.g. Open). These items can be labeled with text, graphics or a combination of both. Each of them should have a character defined as its unique key for access. Grouped logically by their functionality, they are separated visually by menu separators in groups. For example, The File menu is a common menu title for tasks that apply to a file, as Open,Save,Close,Print…; // a popup menu; fMenuFile = new TGPopupMenu(gClient->GetRoot());. // adding menu entries; fMenuFile->AddEntry(""&Open..."",M_FILE_OPEN);; fMenuFile->AddEntry(""&Save"",M_FILE_SAVE);; fMenuFile->AddEntry(""S&ave as..."",M_FILE_SAVEAS);; fMenuFile->AddEntry(""&Close"", -1);. // adding separator; fMenuFile->AddSeparator();. // next group of menu entries; fMenuFile->AddEntry(""&Print"",M_FILE_PRINT);; fMenuFile->AddEntry(""P&rint setup..."",M_FILE_PRINTSETUP);; . . .; fMenuFile->AddSeparator();; fMenuFile->AddEntry(""E&xit"",M_FILE_EXIT);; First we create the File menu by creating an object of classTGPopupMenu and adding menu entries with AddEntry method.

We knew that there is no better way to learn a new programming environment than to use it to write a program that can solve a real problem.

Again, a few weeks later we had another rewrite of the package without templates since we could only compile the version with templates on one single platform using a specific compiler. Finally, after about four months we had a histogramming package that was faster and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based HBOOK histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born ROOT.

Please send your comments, corrections, questions, and suggestions to the rootdoc list: rootdoc@cern.ch; We attempt to give the user insight into the many capabilities of ROOT. The book begins with the elementary functionality and progresses in complexity reaching the specialized topics at the end. The experienced user looking for special topics may find these chapters useful: see “Networking”, “Writing a Graphical User Interface”, “Threads”, and “PROOF: Parallel Processing”.; 1.3 Conventions Used in This Book; We tried to follow a style convention for the sake of clarity. The styles in used are described below.; To show source code in scripts or source files:; {; cout << "" Hello"" << endl;; float x = 3.;; float y = 5.;; int i = 101;; cout <<"" x = ""<<x<<"" y = ""<<y<<"" i = ""<<i<< endl;; }; To show the ROOT command line, we show the ROOT prompt without numbers. In the interactive system, the ROOT prompt has a line number (root[12]); for the sake of simplicity, the line numbers are left off.; root[] TLine l; root[] l.Print(); TLine X1=0.000000 Y1=0.000000 X2=0.000000 Y2=0.000000; Italic bold monotype font indicates a global variable, for example gDirectory.; When a variable term is used, it is shown between angled brackets. In the example below the variable term <library> can be replaced with any library in the $ROOTSYS directory: $ROOTSYS/<library>/inc.; 1.4 The Framework; ROOT is an object-oriented framework aimed at solving the data analysis challenges of high-energy physics. There are two key words in this definition, object oriented and framework. First, we explain what we mean by a framework and then why it is an object-oriented framework.; 1.4.1 What Is a Framework?; Programming inside a framework is a little like living in a city. Plumbing, electricity, telephone, and transportation are services provided by the city.

To have services like telephone and electricity you will need to route the wires to your home. In addition, you cannot build some things yourself. For example, you cannot build a commercial airport on your patch of land. From a global perspective, it would make no sense for everyone to build their own airport. You see you will be very busy building the infrastructure (or framework) before you can use the phone to communicate with your collaborators and have a drink of water at the same time. In software engineering, it is much the same way. In a framework, the basic utilities and services, such as I/O and graphics, are provided. In addition, ROOT being a HEP analysis framework, it provides a large selection of HEP specific utilities such as histograms and fitting. The drawback of a framework is that you are constrained to it, as you are constraint to use the routing algorithm provided by your telephone service. You also have to learn the framework interfaces, which in this analogy is the same as learning how to use a telephone.; If you are interested in doing physics, a good HEP framework will save you much work. Next is a list of the more commonly used components of ROOT: Command Line Interpreter, Histograms and Fitting, Writing a Graphical User Interface, 2D Graphics, Input/Output , Collection Classes, Script Processor.; There are also less commonly used components, as: 3D Graphics, Parallel Processing (PROOF), Run Time Type Identification (RTTI), Socket and Network Communication, Threads.; 1.4.1.1 Advantages of Frameworks; The benefits of frameworks can be summarized as follows:. Less code to write - the programmer should be able to use and reuse the majority of the existing code.

To install ROOT you have the choice to download the binaries or the source. The source is quicker to transfer since it is only ~22 MB, but you will need to compile and link it. The binaries compiled with no debug information range from ~35 MB to ~45 MB depending on the target platform.; The installation and building of ROOT is described in Appendix A: Install and Build ROOT. You can download the binaries, or the source. The GNU g++ compiler on most UNIX platforms can compile ROOT.; Before downloading a binary version make sure your machine contains the right run-time environment. In most cases it is not possible to run a version compiled with, e.g., gcc4.0 on a platform where only gcc 3.2 is installed. In such cases you’ll have to install ROOT from source.; ROOT is currently running on the following platforms: supported platforms. GNU/Linux x86-32 (IA32) and x86-64 (AMD64)(GCC,Intel/icc, Portland/PGCC,KAI/KCC); Intel Itanium (IA64) GNU/Linux (GCC, Intel/ecc, SGI/CC); FreeBSD and OpenBSD (GCC); GNU/Hurd (GCC); HP HP-UX 10.x (IA32) and 11 (IA64) (HP CC, aCC, GCC); IBM AIX 4.1 (xlC compiler, GCC); Sun Solaris for SPARC (SUN C++ compiler, GCC); Sun Solaris for x86 (SUN C++ compiler, KAI/KCC); Compaq Alpha (GCC, KAI/KCC, DEC/CXX); SGI Irix 32 and 64 bits (GCC, KAI/KCC, SGI C++ compiler); Windows >= 95 (Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, Cygwin/GCC); MacOS X PPC, x86-32, x86-64 (GCC, Intel/ICC, IBM/xl); PowerPC with GNU/Linux and GCC, Debian v2; PowerPC64 with GNU/Linux and GCC; ARM with GNU/Linux and GCC; LynxOS. 1.6 The Organization of the ROOT Framework; Now after we know in abstract terms what the ROOT framework is, let us look at the physical directories and files that come with the ROOT installation.

The core library (libCore.so) contains the essentials; it is a part of all ROOT applications. In the Figure 1-2 you see that libCore.so is made up of base classes, container classes, meta information classes, operating system specific classes, and the ZIP algorithm used for compression of the ROOT files.; The Cling library (libCling.so) is also needed in all ROOT applications, and even by libCore. A program referencing only TObject only needs libCore; libCling will be opened automatically. To add the ability to read and write ROOT objects one also has to load libRIO. As one would expect, none of that depends on graphics or the GUI.; Library dependencies have different consequences; depending on whether you try to build a binary, or you just try to access a class that is defined in a library.; 1.6.2.2 Linktime Library Dependencies; When building your own executable you will have to link against the libraries that contain the classes you use. The ROOT reference guide states the library a class is reference guide defined in. Almost all relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by root-config -glibs; the graphics libraries are retuned by root-config --libs. These commands are commonly used in Makefiles. Using root-config instead of enumerating the libraries by hand allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT library names change you will not need to change your Makefile.; A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates, fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core libraries (libCore, libRIO), libHist and libTree. If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically. For example, if the TreeViewer is used, libTreePlayer and all libraries libTreePlayer depends on are loaded also.

Almost all relevant classes can be found in libraries returned by root-config -glibs; the graphics libraries are retuned by root-config --libs. These commands are commonly used in Makefiles. Using root-config instead of enumerating the libraries by hand allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT library names change you will not need to change your Makefile.; A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates, fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core libraries (libCore, libRIO), libHist and libTree. If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically. For example, if the TreeViewer is used, libTreePlayer and all libraries libTreePlayer depends on are loaded also. The dependent libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide’s library dependency graph.

The TPad class is the parent of the TCanvas class. In ROOT, most objects derive from a base class TObject. This class has a virtual method Draw() such as all objects are supposed to be able to be “drawn”. If several canvases are defined, there is only one active at a time. One draws an object in the active canvas by using the statement:; object.Draw(); This instructs the object “object” to draw itself. If no canvas is opened, a default one (named “c1”) is created. In the next example, the first statement defines a function and the second one draws it. A default canvas is created since there was no opened one.

Try to draw the function sin(x)/x again. Every object in a window (which is called a canvas) is, in fact, a graphical object in the sense that you can grab it, resize it, and change its characteristics with a mouse click. For example, bring the cursor over the x-axis. The cursor changes to a hand with a pointing finger when it is over the axis. Now, left click and drag the mouse along the axis to the right. You have a very simple zoom.; When you move the mouse over any object, you can get access to selected methods by pressing the right mouse button and obtaining a context menu. If you try this on the function TF1, you will get a menu showing available methods. The other objects on this canvas are the title, a TPaveText object; the x and y-axis, TAxis objects, the frame, a TFrame object, and the canvas a TCanvas object. Try clicking on these and observe the context menu with their methods. A context menu. For example try selecting the SetRange() method and putting -10, 10 in the dialog box fields.

The THistPainter class specializes in the drawing of histograms. It allows logarithmic axes (x, y, z) when the CONT drawing option is using. The THistPainter class is separated from the histogram so that one can have histograms without the graphics overhead, for example in a batch program. The choice to give each histogram has its own painter rather than a central singleton painter, allows two histograms to be drawn in two threads without overwriting the painter’s values. When a displayed histogram is filled again, you do not have to call the Draw method again. The image is refreshed the next time the pad is updated. A pad is updated after one of these three actions:. A carriage control on the ROOT command line; A click inside the pad; A call to TPad::Update(). By default, the TH1::Draw clears the pad before drawing the new image of the histogram. You can use the ""SAME"" option to leave the previous display intact and superimpose the new histogram. The same histogram can be drawn with different graphics options in different pads. When a displayed histogram is deleted, its image is automatically removed from the pad. To create a copy of the histogram when drawing it, you can use TH1::DrawClone(). This will clone the histogram and allow you to change and delete the original one without affecting the clone.

See “Draw Options” for the list of options.; 3.8.1 Setting the Style; Histograms use the current style gStyle, which is the global object of class TStyle. To change the current style for histograms, the TStyle class provides a multitude of methods ranging from setting the fill color to the axis tick marks.

TH2PolyBin is a very simple class containing the vertices and contents of the polygonal bin as well as several related functions.; Bins are defined using one of the AddBin() methods. The bin definition should be done before filling.; The following very simple macro shows how to build and fill a TH2Poly:; {; TH2Poly *h2p = new TH2Poly();; Double_t x1[] = {0, 5, 5};; Double_t y1[] = {0, 0, 5};; Double_t x2[] = {0, -1, -1, 0};; Double_t y2[] = {0, 0, -1, -1};; Double_t x3[] = {4, 3, 0, 1, 2.4};; Double_t y3[] = {4, 3.7, 1, 4.7, 3.5};; h2p->AddBin(3, x1, y1);; h2p->AddBin(3, x2, y2);; h2p->AddBin(3, x3, y3);; h2p->Fill( 3, 1, 3); // fill bin 1; h2p->Fill(-0.5, -0.5, 7); // fill bin 2; h2p->Fill(-0.7, -0.5, 1); // fill bin 2; h2p->Fill( 1, 3, 5); // fill bin 3; }; More examples can bin found in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/hist/th2poly*.C.

The relationship of two quantities X and Y can be visualized by a two-dimensional histogram or a scatter-plot; its representation is not particularly satisfactory, except for sparse data.

The Fit Panel, which is limited, is best for prototyping. The histogram needs to be drawn in a pad before the Fit Panel is invoked. The method TH1::Fit is more powerful and is used in scripts and programs.; 5.1 The Fit Method; The Fit method is implemented in ROOT for the histogram classes TH1, the sparse histogram classes, THnSparse, the graph classes, TGraph, TGraph2D and TMultiGraph for fitting a collection of Graphs with the same function.; 5.1.1 The TH1::Fit Method; To fit a histogram program",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Only some options apply only for fitting histograms, these are the options “L”, “WL” and “I”. These options apply instead only for TGraph::Fit, the rest of options (appart from “L”, “WL” and “I” are the same). TGraph specific options. “EX0” When fitting a TGraphErrors or a TgraphAsymErrors the errors on the coordinates are not used in the fit; “ROB” in case of linear fitting use the Robust fitting. Compute the LTS regression coefficients (robust (resistant) regression), using the default fraction of good points.; “ROB=0.x” as above, but compute the LTS regression coefficients, using 0.x as a fraction of good points. 5.2 The TF1 function class; Here we will show how to create the TF1 class that is used for fitting histograms and graphs.; 5.2.1 Fit with a Predefined Function; To fit a histogram with a predefined function, simply pass the name of the function in the first parameter of TH1::Fit. For example, this line fits histogram object hist with a Gaussian.; root[] hist.Fit(""gaus"");; The initial parameter values (and eventual limits) for pre-defined functions are set automatically. For overriding the default limits values use the fit option B.; The list of pre-defined functions that can be used with the Fit method is the following:. “gaus” Gaussian function with 3 parameters: f(x) = p0*exp(-0.5*((x-p1)/p2)^2); “expo”An Exponential with 2 parameters: f(x) = exp(p0+p1*x); “polN” A polynomial of degree N, where N is a number between 0 and 9: f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*x2 +...; “chebyshevN” A Chebyshev polynomial of degree N, where N is a number between 0 and 9: f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*(2*x2-1) +...; “landau” Landau function with mean and sigma.

It shows how to use several Gaussian functions with different parameters on separate sub ranges of the same histogram. To use a Gaussian, or any other ROOT built in function, on a sub range you need to define a new TF1. Each is ‘derived’ from the canned function gaus. Fitting a histogram with several Gaussian functions. First, four TF1 objects are created - one for each sub-range:; g1 = new TF1(""m1"",""gaus"",85,95);; g2 = new TF1(""m2"",""gaus"",98,108);; g3 = new TF1(""m3"",""gaus"",110,121);; // The total is the sum of the three, each has 3 parameters; total = new TF1(""mstotal"",""gaus(0)+gaus(3)+gaus(6)"",85,125);; Next, we fill a histogram with bins defined in the array x.; // Create a histogram and set it's contents; h = new TH1F(""g1"",""Example of several fits in subranges"",; np,85,134);; h->SetMaximum(7);; for (int i=0; i<np; i++) {; h->SetBinContent(i+1,x[i]);; }; // Define the parameter array for the total function; Double_t par[9];; When fitting simple functions, such as a Gaussian, the initial values of the parameters are automatically computed by ROOT. In the more complicated case of the sum of 3 Gaussian functions, the initial values of parameters must be set. In this particular case, the initial values are taken from the result of the individual fits. The use of the “+” sign is explained below:; // Fit each function and add it to the list of functions; h->Fit(g1,""R"");; h->Fit(g2,""R+"");; h->Fit(g3,""R+"");. // Get the parameters from the fit; g1->GetParameters(&par[0]);; g2->GetParameters(&par[3]);; g3->GetParameters(&par[6]);. // Use the parameters on the sum; total->SetParameters(par);; h->Fit(total,""R+"");; 5.3.4 Adding Functions to the List; The example $ROOTSYS/tutorials/fit/multifit.C also illustrates how to fit several functions on the same histogram.

They derive from the common generic interface multi-dimensional for function evaluation, ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim. In addition the fitter classes make uses of the generic interfaces for parametric function evaluations, ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim to define the fit model function and use the ROOT::Math::Minimizer interface to perform the minimization of the objective function. More information about the function interface and the multi-dimensional minimization in ROOT is given in the Mathematical Library chapter.; Here we present a detailed description of the ROOT::Fit classes and how to use them. Using these classes instead of the interface provided directly in the ROOT data objects, like TH1::Fit allow are more fine control to configure and customise the fits. For example, using these classes a combined fit of several histograms can be performed.; To understand how these class work, let’s go through a simple example, such as fitting an histogram.; When fitting an histogram, instead of using TH1::Fit we will show in the following hot wo use the ROOT::Fit classes. We will show how to perform the following different type of fits with the histogram data: * a least square fit using the observed errors (Neyman chi-squared); * a least square fit using the expected errors from the function (Pearson chi-squared); * a binned likelihood fit; * an extended unbinned likelihood fits, if the histogram has been set to store in the buffer the original data used to fill it.; Let’s go through all the steps required for performing these fits using the ROOT::Fit::Fitter class. These steps are: 1. Create the input fit data object. 2. Create the input model function. 3. Configure the fit. 4. Perform the data fitting. 5. Examine the result.; 5.7.1 Creating the input fit data; We have two types of input data, binned data (class ROOT::Fit::BinData) used for least square (chi-square) fits of histograms ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The variables in the various Minuit labeled common blocks have been changed to the TMinuit class data members; The internal arrays with a maximum dimension depending on the maximum number of parameters are now data members’ arrays with a dynamic dimension such that one can fit very large problems by simply initializing the TMinuit constructor with the maximum number of parameters; The include file Minuit.h has been commented as much as possible using existing comments in the code or the printed documentation; The original Minuit subroutines are now member functions; Constructors and destructor have been added; Instead of passing the FCN function in the argument list, the addresses of this function is stored as pointer in the data members of the class. This is by far more elegant and flexible in an interactive environment. The member function SetFCN can be used to define this pointer; The ROOT static function Printf is provided to replace all format statements and to print on currently defined output file; The functions SetObjectFit/GetObjectFit can be used inside the FCN function to set/get a referenced object instead of using global variables; By default fGraphicsMode is true.

The figure “The neural net output” shows this plot. The neural net output. As it can be seen, this is a quite efficient technique. As mentioned earlier, neural networks are also used for fitting function. For some application with a cylindrical symmetry, a magnetic field simulation gives as output the angular component of the potential vector A, as well as the radial and z components of the B field.; One wants to fit those distributions with a function in order to plug them into the Geant simulation code. Polynomial fits could be tried, but it seems difficult to reach the desired precision over the full range. One could also use a spline interpolation between known points. In all cases, the resulting field would not be C-infinite.; An example of output (for Br) is shown. First the initial function can be seen as the target. Then, the resulting (normalized) neural net output. In order to ease the learning, the “normalize output” was used here.

This chapter introduces you to some useful insights into C++, to allow you to use some of the most advanced features in ROOT. It is in no case a full course in C++.; 6.1 Classes, Methods and Constructors; C++ extends C with the notion of a class. If you’re used to structures in C, a class is a struct that is a group of related variables, which is extended with functions and routines specific to this structure (class). What is the interest? Consider a struct that is defined this way:; struct Line {; float x1;; float y1;; float x2;; float y2;; }; This structure represents a line to be drawn in a graphical window. (x1,y1) are the coordinates of the first point, (x2,y2) the coordinates of the second point. In the standard C, if you want to draw effectively such a line, you first have to d",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The value of the pointer is set equal to; new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; new, despite its looks, is an operator and creates an object or variable of the type that comes next, Quad in this case, on the heap. Just as with stack objects it has to be initialized by calling its constructor. The syntax requires that the argument list follows the type. This one statement has brought two items into existence, one on the heap and one on the stack. The heap object will live until the delete operator is applied to it.; There is no FORTRAN parallel to a heap object; variables either come or go as control passes in and out of a function or subroutine, or, like a COMMON block variables, live for the lifetime of the program. However, most people in HEP who use FORTRAN will have experience of a memory manager and the act of creating a bank is a good equivalent of a heap object. For those who know systems like ZEBRA, it will come as a relief to learn that objects do not move, C++ does not garbage collect, so there is never a danger that a pointer to an object becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object, it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs.; To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use the “->” operator e.g.:; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; Although we chose to call our pointer my_objptr, to emphasize that it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won’t tolerate an attempt to do something like:; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; As we have seen, heap objects have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be accessed directly.

A multi-line command starts with a { and ends with a }.; Inside continuation, every line has to be correctly terminated with a ; (like in ""real’’ C++).; All objects are created in global scope.; There is no way to back up; you are better off writing a script.; Use .q to exit root. 7.2 Feeding Sources Files To ROOT: C++ Scripts; ROOT script files (often called “Macros”) contain pure C++ code. They can contain a simple sequence of statements like in the multi command line example given above, but also arbitrarily complex class and function definitions.; The most frequent interaction with the ROOT prompt uses .x to “run” a file:; root [] .x myScript.C; This loads myScript.C into the interpreter and calls the function myScript(). You can pass arguments using .x myScript.C(12, ""A String"").; Alternatively you can load the script and then run a function explicitly:; root [] .L myScript.C; root [] myScript(); The above is equivalent to .x myScript.C.; In a named script, the objects created on the stack are deleted when the function exits. In a common scenario you create a histogram in a named script on the stack. You draw the histogram, but when the function exits the canvas is empty and the histogram has disappeared. To avoid the histogram from disappearing you can create it on the heap (by using new). This will leave the histogram object intact, but the pointer in the named script scope will be “gone”. Since histograms (and trees) are added to the list of o",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

For example, in one script you can use ACLiC to compile and load another script.; gROOT->ProcessLine("".L MyScript.C+""); gROOT->ProcessLine("".L MyScript.C++""); 7.4.2 Setting the Include Path; You can get the include path by typing:; root[] .include; You can append to the include path by typing:; root[] .include $HOME/mypackage/include; In a script you can append to the include path:; gSystem->AddIncludePath("" -I$HOME/mypackage/include ""); You can also overwrite the existing include path:; gSystem->SetIncludePath("" -I$HOME/mypackage/include ""); The $ROOTSYS/include directory is automatically appended to the include path, so you do not have to worry about including it. To add library that should be used during linking of the shared library use something like:; gSystem->AddLinkedLibs(""-L/my/path -lanylib"");; This is especially useful for static libraries. For shared ones you can also simply load them before trying to compile the script:; gSystem->Load(""mydir/mylib"");; ACLiC uses the directive fMakeSharedLibs to create the shared library. If loading the shared library fails, it tries to output a list of missing symbols by creating an executable (on some platforms like OSF, this does not HAVE to be an executable) containing the script. It uses the directive fMakeExe to do so. For both directives, before passing them to TSystem::Exec(), it expands the variables $SourceFiles, $SharedLib, $LibName, $IncludePath, $LinkedLibs, $ExeNameand$ObjectFiles. See SetMakeSharedLib() for more information on those variables. When the file being passed to ACLiC is on a read only file system, ACLiC warns the user and creates the library in a temporary directory:; root[] .L readonly/t.C++; Warning in <ACLiC>: /scratch/aclic/subs/./readonly is not writable!; Warning in <ACLiC>: Output will be written to /tmp; Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC>: creating shared library; /tmp//scratch/aclic/subs/./readonly/t_C.so; To select the temporary directory ACLiC lo",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Also, a new interface TSystem::Get/SetBuildDir is introduced to let users select an alternative ‘root’ for building of the ACLiC libraries. For filename/full/path/name/macro.C, the library is created as fBuildDir/full/path/name/macro_C.so.; 7.4.3 Dictionary Generation; You can direct what is added to the dictionary generated by ACLiC in two ways. The simplest way is to add at the end of script (i.e. after the symbols have been defined) something like:; #if defined(__ROOTCLING__); #pragma link C++ class MyOtherClass;; #endif; You can also write this portion of code in a file name MyScript_linkdef.h where the suffix '_linkdef'is the prefix defined by the key ‘ACLiC.Linkdef‘ in the currently used resource file (usually .rootrcor$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc) and the prefix is the name of your script.; The default behavior of rootcling is to not link in (i.e. generate the dictionary for) any of the symbols. In particular, this means that the following lines are, in the general case, unnecessary.; #pragma link off all globals;; #pragma link off all classes;; #pragma link off all functions;; This also means that linking the instantiation of a class template:; #pragma link C++ class mytemplate<int>;; ONLY links this specific class.

You need to request the generation of the iterators explicitly.; See the documentation of rootcling for details how pragma can be used.; NOTE: You should not call ACLiC with a script that has a function called main().; 7.4.4 Intermediate Steps and Files; ACLiC executes two steps and a third one if needed. These are:. Calling rootcling to create a dictionary using rootcling.; Calling the compiler to build the shared library from the script.; If there are errors, it calls the compiler to build a dummy executable to clearly report unresolved symbols. ACLiC makes a shared library with a dictionary containing the classes and functions declared in the script. It also adds the classes and functions declared in included files with the same name as the script file and any of the following extensions: .h, .hh, .hpp, .hxx, .hPP, .hXX. This means that, by default, you cannot combine scripts from different files into one library by using #include statements; you will need to compile each script separately. In a future release, we plan to add the global variables declared in the script to the dictionary also. If you are curious about the specific calls, you can raise the ROOT debug level: gDebug=3 and ACLiC will print these steps. If you need to keep the intermediate files around, for example when debugging the script using gdb, use gDebug=7.; 7.4.5 Moving between Interpreter and Compiler; The best way to develop portable scripts is to make sure you can always run them with both, the int",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

In addition it contains the gHtml object, gMinuit objects, and the array of contours graphs (TGraph) created when calling the Draw method of a histogram with the ""CONT, LIST"" option.; 8.2.2 Access to the Collection Contents; The current content for a collection listed above can be accessed with the corresponding gROOT->GetListOf method (for example gROOT->GetListOfCanvases). In addition, gROOT->GetListOfBrowsables returns a collection of all objects visible on the left side panel in the browser. See the image of the Object Browser in the next figure. The ROOT Object Browser. 8.3 Ownership by Other Objects; When an object creates another, the creating object is the owner of the created one. For example:; myHisto->Fit(""gaus""); The call to Fit copies the global TF1 Gaussian function and attaches the copy to the histogram. When the histogram is deleted, the copy is deleted also.; When a pad is deleted or cleared, all objects in the pad with the kCanDelete bit set are deleted automatically. Currently the objects created by the DrawCopy methods, have the kCanDelete bit set and are therefore owned by the pad.; 8.4 Ownership by the User; The user owns all objects not described in one of the above cases. TObject has two bits, kCanDelete and kMustCleanup, that influence how an object is managed (in TObject::fBits). These are in an enumeration in TObject.h. To set these bits do:; MyObject->SetBit(kCanDelete); MyObject->SetBit(kMustCleanup); The bits can be reset and tested with the TObject::ResetBit and TObject::TestBit methods.; 8.4.1 The kCanDelete Bit; The gROOT collections (see above) own their members and will delete them regardless of the kCanDelete bit. In all other collections, when the collection Clear method is called (i.e. TList::Clear()), members with the kCanDelete bit set, are deleted and removed from the collection.

To interactively make an object “active”, you can use the middle mouse button. In case of canvases or pads, the border becomes highlighted when it is active.; 9.2.2.2 With C++ Statements (Programmatically); Frequently we want to draw in different canvases or pads. By default, the objects are drawn in the active canvas. To activate a canvas you can use the TPad::cd() method.; root[] c1->cd(); 9.2.3 Context Menus: the Right Mouse Button; The context menus are a way to interactively call certain methods of an object. When designing a class, the programmer can add methods to the context menu of the object by making minor changes to the header file.; 9.2.3.1 Using Context Menus; On a ROOT canvas, you can right-click on any object and see the context menu for it. The script hsimple.C draws a histogram. The image below shows the context menus for some of the objects on the canvas. Next picture shows that drawing a simple histogram involves as many as seven objects. When selecting a method from the context menu and that method has options, the user will be asked for numerical values or strings to fill in the option. For example, TAxis::SetTitle will prompt you for a string to use for the axis title. Context menus of different objects in a canvas. 9.2.3.2 Structure of the Context Menus; The curious reader will have noticed that each entry in the context menu corresponds to a method of the class. Look for example to the menu named TAxis::xaxis. xaxis is the name of the object and TAxis the name of its class. If we look at the list of TAxis methods, for example in https://root.cern/doc/master/classTAxis.html, we see the methods SetTimeDisplay() andUnZoom(), which appear also in the context menu.; There are several divisions in the context menu, separated by lines. The top division is a list of the class methods; the second division is a list of the parent class methods.

To retrieve a later instance you can use GetListOfPrimitives(), which returns a list of all the objects on the pad. From the list you can select the object you need.; 9.3.1.2 Hiding an Object; Hiding an object in a pad can be made by removing it from the list of objects owned by that pad. This list is accessible by the GetListOfPrimitives() method of TPad. This method returns a pointer to a TList. Suppose we get the pointer to the object, we want to hide, call it obj (see paragraph above). We get the pointer to the list:; root[] li = gPad->GetListOfPrimitives(); Then remove the object from this list:; root[] li->Remove(obj); The object will disappear from the pad as soon as the pad is updated (try to resize it for example). If one wants to make the object reappear:; root[] obj->Draw(); Caution, this will not work with composed objects, for example many histograms drawn on the same plot (with the option “same”). There are other ways! Try to use the method described here for simple objects.; 9.3.2 The Coordinate Systems of a Pad; There are coordinate systems in a TPad: user coordinates, normalized coordinates (NDC), and pixel coordinates. Pad coordinate systems. 9.3.2.1 The User Coordinate System; The most common is the user coordinate system. Most methods of TPad use the user coordinates, and all graphic primitives have their parameters defined in terms of user coordinates. By default, when an empty pad is drawn, the user coordinates are set to a range from 0 to 1 starting at the lower left corner. At this point they are equivalent of the NDC coordinates (see below). If you draw a high level graphical object, such as a histogram or a function, the user coordinates are set to the coordinates of the histogram. Therefore, when you set a point it will be in the histogram coordinates.; For a newly created blank pad, one may use TPad::Range to set the user coordinate system. This function is defined as:; void Range(float x1,float y1,floa",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Absolute pixel to user; AbsPixeltoX(apx); AbsPixeltoY(apy); AbsPixeltoXY(apx,apy,&ux,&uy); Double_t; Double_t; Double_t ux,uy. Note: all the pixel conversion functions along the Y axis consider that py=0 is at the top of the pad except PixeltoY() which assume that the position py=0 is at the bottom of the pad. To make PixeltoY() converting the same way as the other conversion functions, it should be used the following way (p is a pointer to a TPad):; p->PixeltoY(py - p->GetWh());; 9.3.4 Dividing a Pad into Sub-pads; Dividing a pad into sub pads in order for instance to draw a few histograms, may be done in two ways. The first is to build pad objects and to draw them into a parent pad, which may be a canvas. The second is to automatically divide a pad into horizontal and vertical sub pads.; 9.3.4.1 Creating a Single Sub-pad; The simplest way to divide a pad is to build sub-pads in it. However, this forces the user to explicitly indicate the size and position of those sub-pads. Suppose we want to build a sub-pad in the active pad (pointed by gPad). First, we build it, using a TPad constructor:; root[] spad1 = new TPad(""spad1"",""The first subpad"",.1,.1,.5,.5); One gives the coordinates of the lower left point (0.1, 0.1) and of the upper right one (0.5, 0.5). These coordinates are in NDC. This means that they are independent of the user coordinates system, in particular if you have already drawn for example a histogram in the mother pad. The only thing left is to draw the pad:; root[] spad1->Draw(); If you want more sub-pads, you have to repeat this procedure as many times as necessary.; 9.3.4.2 Dividing a Canvas into Sub-Pads; The manual way of dividing a pad into sub-pads is sometimes very tedious. There is a way to automatically generate horizontal and vertical sub-pads inside a given pad.; root[] pad1->Divide(3,2).

Setting it on the containing pad does not automatically propagate to the sub-pads. Here is an example of how to set the log scale for the x-axis on a canvas with four sub-pads:; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas(""MyCanvas"",""My Canvas""); root[] MyCanvas->Divide(2,2); root[] MyCanvas->cd(1); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(2); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(3); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); 9.3.8 WaitPrimitive method; When the TPad::WaitPrimitive() method is called with no arguments, it will wait until a double click or any key pressed is executed in the canvas. A call to gSystem->Sleep(10) has been added in the loop to avoid consuming at all the CPU. This new option is convenient when executing a macro. By adding statements like:; canvas->WaitPrimitive();; You can monitor the progress of a running macro, stop it at convenient places with the possibility to interact with the canvas and resume the execution with a double click or a key press.; 9.3.9 Locking the Pad; You can make the TPad non-editable.

It is also possible, for some particular purposes to build axis on their own. This may be useful for example in the case one wants to draw two axis for the same plot, one on the left and one on the right.; For historical reasons, there are two classes representing axis. TAxis * axis is the axis object, which will be returned when calling the TH1::GetAxis() method.; TAxis *axis = histo->GetXaxis(); Of course, you may do the same for Y and Z-axis. The graphical representation of an axis is done with the TGaxis class. The histogram classes and TGraph generate instances of this class. This is internal and the user should not have to see it.; 9.5.1 Axis Title; The axis title is set, as with all named objects, by; axis->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want"");; When the axis is embedded into a histogram or a graph, one has to first extract the axis object:; h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want""); 9.5.2 Axis Options and Characteristics; The axis options are most simply set with the styles. The available style options controlling specific axis options are the following:; TAxis *axis = histo->GetXaxis();; axis->SetAxisColor(Color_t color = 1);; axis->SetLabelColor(Color_t color = 1);; axis->SetLabelFont(Style_t font = 62);; axis->SetLabelOffset(Float_t offset = 0.005);; axis->SetLabelSize(Float_t size = 0.04);; axis->SetNdivisions(Int_t n = 510, Bool_t optim = kTRUE);; axis->SetNoExponent(Bool_t noExponent = kTRUE);; axis->SetTickLength(Float_t length = 0.03);; axis->SetTitleOffset(Float_t offset = 1);; axis->SetTitleSize(Float_t size = 0.02);; The getters corresponding to the described setters are also available. The general options, not specific to axis, as for instance SetTitleTextColor() are valid and do have an effect on axis characteristics.; 9.5.3 Setting the Number of Divisions; Use TAxis::SetNdivisions(ndiv,optim) to set the number of divisions for an axis.

When objects are created, their default attributes are taken from the current style. The current style is an object of the class TStyle and can be referenced via the global variable gStyle (in TStyle.h). See the class TStyle for a complete list of the attributes that can be set in one style.; ROOT provides several styles called:. “Default” - the default style; “Plain” - the simple style (black and white); “Bold” - bolder lines; “Video” - suitable for html output or screen viewing. The “Default” style is created by:; TStyle *default = new TStyle(""Default"",""Default Style"");; The “Plain” style can be used if you want to get a “conventional” PostScript output or if you are working on a monochrome display.

For example, you may have created a histogram in a previous session and saved it in a file. Meanwhile, if you have changed the style, the histogram will be drawn with the old attributes. You can force the current style attributes to be set when you read an object from a file by calling ForceStyle before reading the objects from the file.; gROOT->ForceStyle();; When you call gROOT->ForceStyle() and read an object from a ROOT file, the object’s method UseCurrentStyle is called. The attributes saved with the object are replaced by the current style attributes. You call also call myObject->UseCurrentStyle() directly. For example if you have a canvas or pad with your histogram or any other object, you can force these objects to get the attributes of the current style by:; canvas->UseCurrentStyle();; The description of the style functions should be clear from the name of the TStyle setters or getters.

A typical interaction between viewer and client using these, taken from TGeoPainter is:; TVirtualViewer3D * viewer = gPad->GetViewer3D();; // Does viewer prefer local frame positions?; Bool_t localFrame = viewer->PreferLocalFrame();; // Perform first fetch of buffer from the shape and try adding it to the viewer; const TBuffer3D &buffer = shape.GetBuffer3D(TBuffer3D::kCore |; TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox |; TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific,; localFrame);; Int_t reqSections = viewer->AddObject(buffer, &addDaughters);. // If the viewer requires additional sections fetch from the shape; // (if possible) and add again; if (reqSections != TBuffer3D::kNone); shape.GetBuffer3D(reqSections, localFrame);; Together these allow clients to publish objects to any one of the 3D viewers free of viewer specific drawing code. They allow our simple x3d viewer, and considerably more sophisticated OpenGL one to both work with both geometry libraries (g3d and geom) efficiently.; In addition to external viewers, created in separate windows, this architecture is also used by internal TPad drawing when it requires 3D projections. Publishing to a viewer consists of the following steps:; 1- Create / obtain viewer handle.; 2- Begin scene on viewer.; 3- Fill mandatory parts of TBuffer3D describing object.; 4- Add to viewer.; 5- Fill optional parts of TBuffer3D as requested by viewer.; [ …. repeat 3/4/5 as required for other/child objects]; 6- End scene on viewer.; You should attach the top-level node of your external geometry (or the manager) to a TPad object using TObject::Draw(), and perform the publishing to the viewer in your object’s TObject::Paint() overloaded method.

Others always require a tessellation description based on TBuffer3D’s kRaw / kRawSizes points/lines/segments sections.; Some need the 3D object positions in the master (world) frame, others can cope with local frames and a translation matrix to place the object.; Some require bounding boxes for objects - others do not. Similarly some viewer clients are only capable of providing positions in master frame, cannot provide bounding boxes etc. Additionally we do not want to incur the cost of expensive tessellation operations if the viewer does not require them. To cope with these variations the TBuffer3D objects are filled by negotiation with the viewer. TBuffer3D class hierarchy. TBuffer3D classes are conceptually divided into enumerated sections: kCore, kBoundingBox, kRaw - see the class diagram and the file TBuffer3D.h for more details. The TBuffer3D methods SectionsValid(), SetSectionsValid(), ClearSectionsValid() are used to test, set, clear these section validity flags e.g.; buffer.SetSectionsValid(TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific);; ...; if (buffer.SectionsValid(TBuffer3D:: kShapeSpecific)) {; ...; }; The sections found in the base TBuffer3D (kCore/kBoundingBox/kRawSizes/kRaw) are sufficient to describe any tessellated shape in a generic fashion. An additional kShapeSpecific section is added in TBuffer3D derived classes, allowing a more abstract shape description (“a sphere of inner radius x, outer radius y”). This enables a viewer, which knows how to draw (tessellate) the shape itself to do so, while providing a generic fallback suitable for all viewers. The rules for client negotiation with the viewer are:. If suitable specialized TBuffer3D class exists, use it, otherwise use TBuffer3D.; Complete the mandatory kCore section.; Complete the kShapeSpecific section if applicable.; Complete the kBoundingBox if you can.; Pass this buffer to the viewer using one of the TBuffer3D::AddObject() me",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Splitting avoids having to do the expensive tessellation on the first pass. 9.13.4.4 Shape Specific TBuffer3D Derived Classes; Currently we provide the following shape specific classes, which the GL Viewer can take advantage of (see TBuffer3D.h and TBuffer3DTypes.h). TBuffer3DSphere - solid, hollow and cut spheres (GL Viewer only supports solid spheres at present - cut / hollow ones will be requested as tessellated objects by client.); TBuffer3DTube - basic tube with inner/outer radius and length.; TBuffer3DTubeSeg - angle tube segment.; TBuffer3DCutTube - angle tube segment with plane cut ends. See the above example from TGeoSphere::GetBuffer3D and also equivalent functions in TGeoTube, TGeoTubeSeg and TGeoCtub. Anyone is free to add new TBuffer3D classes, but it should be clear that one or more viewers will require updating to be able to take advantage of them. Hence we only provide classes which existing viewers can benefit from. The number of native shapes in GL Viewer will be expanded in the future.; 9.13.4.5 Master / Local Reference Frames; The Core section of TBuffer3D contains two members relating to reference frames:. fLocalFrame: indicates if any positions in the buffer (bounding box and tessellation vertexes) are in local or master (world frame).; fLocalMaster: is a standard 4x4 translation matrix (OpenGL column major ordering) for placing the object into the 3D master frame. If fLocalFrame is false, fLocalMaster should contain an identity matrix. This is set by default, and can be reset using the TBuffer3D::SetLocalMasterIdentity() method.; 9.13.4.6 Bounding Boxes; You are not obliged to complete the kBoundingBox section, as any viewer requiring one internally (GL Viewer) will build it if you do not provide.

However to do this the viewer will force you to provide the (expensive) raw tessellation, and the resulting box will be axis aligned with the overall scene, which is non-ideal for rotated shapes. As we need to support orientated (rotated) bounding boxes, TBuffer3D requires the 6 vertices of the box. We also provide a convenience function, TBuffer::SetAABoundingBox(), for simpler case of setting an axis aligned bounding box. The bounding box should be filled in same frame (local / master) as the rest of the TBuffer3D, and in accordance with fLocalFrame flag.; A typical example from TGeoBBox::FillBuffer3D:; if (reqSections & TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox) {; Double_t halfLengths[3] = { fDX, fDY, fDZ };; buffer.SetAABoundingBox(fOrigin, halfLengths);; if (!buffer.fLocalFrame) {; TransformPoints(buffer.fBBVertex[0], 8);; }; buffer.SetSectionsValid(TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox);; }; 9.13.4.7 Logical and Physical Objects; Some viewers can support two types of object placement:. Add object as a single independent entity in the world reference frame - e.g. a sphere, radius r, at x, y, z.; Repeated placement (copying) in world frame of this locally unique piece of geometry (described in local reference frame) e.g. define a sphere S (radius r), place copy at x1, y1, z1, another copy at x2, y2, z2 etc. The second case is very typical in geometry packages, e.g. ROO",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

In all these cases TBuffer3D::AddObject() returns kNone, as it does for successful addition, indicating it does not require further information about this object. Hence you should not try to make any assumptions about what the viewer did with the object. The viewer may decide to force the client to rebuild (republish) the scene, obtaining a different collection of objects, if the internal viewer state changes .e.g. significant camera move. It does this presently by forcing a repaint on the attached TPad object - hence you should attach you master geometry object to the pad (via TObject::Draw()), and perform the publishing to the viewer in response to TObject::Paint().; 9.13.4.9 Physical IDs; TVirtualViewer3D provides for two methods of object addition:; virtual Int_t AddObject(const TBuffer3D &buffer,; Bool_t * addChildren = 0); virtual Int_t AddObject(UInt_t physicalID,; const TBuffer3D & buffer,; Bool_t *addChildren = 0); If you use the first (simple) case a viewer using logical/physical pairs will generate sequential IDs for each physical object internally. Scene rebuilds will require destruction and recreation of all physical objects. For the second you can specify an identifier from the client side, which must be unique and stable - i.e. the IDs of a published object is consistent, regardless of changes in termination of contained child geometry branches. In this case the viewer can safely cache the physical objects across scene rebuilds, discarding those no longer of interest.; 9.13.4.10 Child Objects; In many geometries there is a rigid containment hierarchy, and so if the viewer is not interested in a certain object due to limits/size then it will also not be interest in any of the contained branch of siblings. Both TBuffer3D::AddObject() methods have an addChildren return parameter.

Both TBuffer3D::AddObject() methods have an addChildren return parameter. The viewer will complete this (if passed) indicating if children of the object just sent are worth sending.; 9.13.4.11 Recycling TBuffer3D; Once add TBuffer3D::AddObject() has been called, the contents are copied to the viewer’s internal data structures. You are free to destroy this TBuffer3D, or recycle it for the next object if suitable.; 9.13.4.12 Examples; For an example of a simple geometry, working in master reference frame examine the code under $ROOTSYS/g3d. For a more complex example, which works in both master and local frames, and uses logical/physical division of shape geometry and placement, examine the code under $ROOTSYS/geom - in particular TGeoShape hierarchy, and the painter object TGeoPainter (under geopainter) where the negotiation with the viewer is performed.; 10 Folders and Tasks; 10.1 Folders. A TFolder is a collection of objects visible and expandable in the ROOT object browser. Folders have a name and a title and are identified in the folder hierarchy by an “UNIX-like” naming convention. The base of all folders is //root. It is visible at the top of the left panel in the browser. The browser shows several folders under //root.; New folders can be added and removed to/from a folder.; 10.2 Why Use Folders?; One reason to use folders is to reduce class dependencies and improve modularity. Each set of data has a producer class and one or many consumer classes. When ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The objects have pointers to each other to access each other’s data. Pointers are an efficient way to share data between classes. However, a direct pointer creates a direct coupling between classes. This design can become a very tangled web of dependencies in a system with a large number of classes. In the second diagram, a reference to the data is in the folder and the consumers refer to the folder rather than each other to access the data. The naming and search service provided by the ROOT folders hierarchy provides an alternative. It loosely couples the classes and greatly enhances I/O operations. In this way, folders separate the data from the algorithms and greatly improve the modularity of an application by minimizing the class dependencies. In addition, the folder hierarchy creates a picture of the data organization. This is useful when discussing data design issues or when learning the data organization. The example below illustrates this point.; 10.3 How to Use Folders; Using folders means to build a hierarchy of folders, posting the reference to the data in the folder by the producer, and creating a reference to the folder by the user.; 10.3.1 Creating a Folder Hierarchy; To create a folder hierarchy you add the top folder of your hierarchy to //root. Then you add a folder to an existing folder with the TFolder::AddFolder method. This method takes two parameters: the name and title of the folder to be added. It returns a pointer of the newly created folder.; The code below creates the folder hierarchy shown in the browser. In this macro, the folder is also added to the list of browsable. This way, it is visible in the browser on the top level.; {; // Add the top folder of my hierary to //root; TFolder *aliroot=gROOT->GetRootFolder()->AddFolder(""aliroot"",; ""aliroot top level folders"");; // Add the hierarchy to the list of browsables; gROOT",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

ExecuteTask will recursively call:. the TTask::Execmethod of the derived class;; the TTask::ExecuteTasks to execute for each task the list of its subtasks;. If the top level task is added to the list of ROOT browsable objects, the tree of tasks can be seen in the ROOT browser. To add it to the browser, get the list of browsable objects first and add it to the collection.; gROOT->GetListOfBrowsables()->Add(run);; The first parameter of the Add method is a pointer to a TTask, the second parameter is the string to show in the browser. If the string is left out, the name of the task is used.; After executing, the script above the browser will look like in this figure.; 10.5 Execute and Debug Tasks; The browser can be used to start a task, set break points at the beginning of a task or when the task has completed. At a breakpoint, data structures generated by the execution up this point may be inspected asynchronously and then the execution can be resumed by selecting the “Continue” function of a task.; A task may be active or inactive (controlled by TTask::SetActive). When a task is inactive, its sub tasks are not executed. A task tree may be made persistent, saving the status of all the tasks.; 11 Input/Output. This chapter covers the saving and reading of objects to and from ROOT files. It begins with an explanation of the physical layout of a ROOT file. It includes a discussion on compression, and file recovery. Then we explain the logical file, the class TFile and its methods. We show how to navigate in a file, how to save objects and read them back. We also include a discussion on Streamers. Streamers are the methods responsible to capture an objects current state to save it to disk or send it over the network. At the end of the chapter is a discussion on the two specialized ROOT files: TNetFile and TWebFile.; 11.1 The Physical Layout of ROOT Files; A ROOT file is like a UNIX file d",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

TH1F; all classes in the TH1F inheritance tree; all classes of the object data members; all classes in the object data members’ inheritance tree. This description is implemented by the TStreamerInfo class, and is often referred to as simply StreamerInfo. You can print a file’s StreamerInfolist with the TFile::ShowStreamerInfo method. Below is an example of the output. Only the first line of each class description is shown. The demo.root example contains only TH1F objects.

It does not write the buffer to a file, it simply populates a buffer with bytes representing the object. This allows us to write the buffer to a file or do anything else we could do with the buffer. For example, we can write it to a socket to send it over the network. This is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is worthwhile to emphasize the need and advantage of separating the creation of the buffer from its use. Let us look how a buffer is written to a file. The dictionary for a class needs to be loaded before any object of that type can be saved.; The TObject::Write method does the following:. Creates a TKey object in the current directory; Creates a TBuffer object which is part of the newly created TKey; Fills the TBuffer with a call to the class::Streamer method; Creates a second buffer for compression, if needed; Reserves space by scanning the TFree list. At this point, the size of the buffer is known.; Writes the buffer to the file; Releases the TBuffer part of the key.

The version number is written to the file in the Streamer by the call TBuffer::WriteVersion. You, as the designer of the class, do not need to do any manual modification in the Streamer.

The time to uncompress an object is small compared to the compression time and is independent of the selected compression level. Note that the compression level may be changed at any time, but the new compression level will only apply to newly written objects. Consequently, a ROOT file may contain objects with different compression levels. This table shows four runs of the demo script that creates 15 histograms with different compression parameters. To make the numbers more significant, the macro was modified to create 1000 histograms. We have included two more examples to show the impact of compression on Trees in the next chapter.; 11.6.1 Using the General Open Function of TFile; To make life simple we provide a general function to open any type of file (except shared memory files of class TMapFile). This functionality is provided by the static TFile::Open() function:; TFile *TFile::Open(const Text_t *name,Option_t *option="""",; const Text_t *title="""",Int_t compress,Int_t netopt); Depending on the name argument, the function returns a TFile or one of its derivations, for example a TNetXNGFile or a TDavixFile object. In case a URL specifies a local file, a TFile object will be returned (and of course no login information is needed). The arguments of the Open() function are the same as the ones for the TFile constructor.; Using ReOpen() method it is possible to reopen a file with a different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE, RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either “READ” or “UPDATE”. The method returns:. 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;; 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or there were wrong input arguments);; -1 i",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects, ROOT has designed the TTree and TNtuple classes specifically for that purpose. The TTree class is optimized to reduce disk space and enhance access speed. A TNtuple is a TTree that is limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a TTree on the other hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to all the simple types.; When using a TTree, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is important to realize that each object is not written individually, but rather collected and written a bunch at a time.; This is where the TTree takes advantage of compression and will produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the TTree contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects can be compressed.; The TTree reduces the header of each object, but it still contains the class name. Using compression, the class name of each same-class object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name.

The return value is the number of entries in the Index (< 0 indicates failure).; 12.8 Branches; The organization of branches allows the designer to optimize the data for the anticipated use. The class for a branch is called TBranch. If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches. If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates on it. A variable on a TBranch is called a leaf (yes - TLeaf). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that branches of the same TTree can be written to separate files. To add a TBranch to a TTree we call the method TTree::Branch(). Note that we DO NOT use the TBranch constructor.; The TTree::Branch method has several signatures. The branch type differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a TList, or an array of objects. Let’s see some examples. To follow along you will need the shared library libEvent.so. First, check if it is in $ROOTSYS/test. If it is, copy it to your own area. If it is not there, you have to build it by typing make in $ROOTSYS/test.; 12.9 Adding a Branch to Hold a List of Variables; As in the very first example (cernstaff.root.root) the data we want to save is a list of simple variables, such as integers or floats. In this case, we use the following TTree::Branch signature:; tree->Branch(""Ev_Branch"",&event,; ""temp/F:ntrack/I:nseg:nvtex:flag/i"");; The first parameter is the branch name.; The second parameter is the address from which the first variable is to be read.

If your structure does not qualify, you need to create one branch for each element of the structure.; The leaf name is NOT used to pick the variable out of the structure, but is only used as the name for the leaf.

This leaf list has three integers called ntrack, nseg, and nvtex.; ""ntrack/I:nseg:nvtex""; There is one more rule: when no type is given for the very first leaf, it becomes a float (F). This leaf list has three floats called temp, mass, and px.; ""temp:mass:px""; The symbols used for the type are:. C: a character string terminated by the 0 character; B: an 8 bit signed integer; b: an 8 bit unsigned integer; S: a 16 bit signed integer; s: a 16 bit unsigned integer; I: a 32 bit signed integer; i: a 32 bit unsigned integer; L: a 64 bit signed integer; l: a 64 bit unsigned integer; G: a long signed integer, stored as 64 bit; g: a long unsigned integer, stored as 64 bit; F: a 32 bit floating point; D: a 64 bit floating point; O: [the letter ‘o’, not a zero] a boolean (Bool_t). The type is used for a byte count to decide how much space to allocate. The variable written is simply the block of bytes starting at the starting address given in the second parameter. It may or may not match the leaf list depending on whether or not the programmer is being careful when choosing the leaf address, name, and type.; By default, a variable will be copied with the number of bytes specified in the type descriptor symbol. However, if the type consists of two characters, the number specifies the number of bytes to be used when copying the variable to the output buffer. The line below describes ntrack to be written as a 16-bit integer (rather than a 32-bit integer).; ""ntrack/I2""; With this Branch method, you can also add a leaf that holds an entire array of variables.

If we multiply the number of tracks by 7 s, (1,000,000,000 * 7 * 10-6) we calculate that the time allocating and freeing memory is about 2 hours. This is the chunk of time saved when a TClonesArray is used rather than a TObjArray. If you do not want to wait 2 hours for your tracks (or equivalent objects), be sure to use a TClonesArray for same-class objects arrays. Branches with TClonesArrays use the same method (TTree::Branch) as any other object described above. If splitting is specified the objects in the TClonesArray are split, not the TClonesArray itself.; 12.10.4 Identical Branch Names; When a top-level object (say event), has two data members of the same class the sub branches end up with identical names. To distinguish the sub branch we must associate them with the master branch by including a “.” (a dot) at the end of the master branch name. This will force the name of the sub branch to be master.sub branch instead of simply sub branch. For example, a tree has two branches Trigger and MuonTrigger, each containing an object of the same class (Trigger). To identify uniquely the sub branches we add the dot:; tree->Branch(""Trigger."",""Trigger"",&b1,8000,1);; tree->Branch(""MuonTrigger."",""Trigger"",&b2,8000,1);; If Trigger has three members, T1, T2, T3, the two instructions above will generate sub branches called: Trigger.T1, Trigger.T2, Trigger.T3, MuonTrigger.T1, MuonTrigger.T2, andMuonTrigger.T3.; 12.11 Adding a Branch with a Folder; Use the syntax below to add a branch from a folder:; tree->Branch(""/aFolder"");; This method creates one branch for each element in the folder.

After this script is executed we have a ROOT file called tree1.root with a tree called t1. There is a possibility to fill branches one by one using the method TBranch::Fill().

In the right panel of the ROOT object browse are the branches: ev, px, py, pz, and random. Note that these are shown as leaves because they are “end” branches with only one leaf. To histogram a leaf, we can simply double click on it in the browser. This is how the tree t1 looks in the Tree Viewer. Here we can add a cut and add other operations for histogramming the leaves. See “The Tree Viewer”. For example, we can plot a two dimensional histogram.

For example, if one variable in the tree was computed with a certain algorithm, you may want to try another algorithm and compare the results. One solution is to add a new branch, fill it, and save the tree. The code below adds a simple branch to an existing tree.

However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your analysis. For these cases, you can use TTree::MakeClass. It creates a class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand it to do the logic of your analysis.; The TTree::MakeSelector is the recommended method for ROOT data analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor.

The spider plot graphics editor provides two tabs to interact with the spider plots’ output: the tab “Style” defining the spider layout and the tab “Browse” to navigate in the tree.; 12.20.8.2 Parallel Coordinates Plots. The Parallel Coordinates Plots are a common way of studying and visualizing multiple variables data sets. They were proposed by in A.Inselberg in 1981 as a new way to represent multi-dimensional information. In traditional Cartesian coordinates, axes are mutually perpendicular. In Parallel coordinates, all axes are parallel which allows representing data in much more than three dimensions. To show a set of points in Parallel Coordinates, a set of parallel lines is drawn, typically vertical and equally spaced. A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes. The position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point. The three following figures show some very simple examples:. The Parallel Coordinates representation of the six dimensional point (-5,3,4,2,0,1). The line y = -3x+20 and a circle in Parallel Coordinates. The Parallel Coordinates technique is good at: spotting irregular events, seeing the data trend, finding correlations and clusters. Its main weakness is the cluttering of the output. Because each “point” in the multidimensional space is represented as a line, the output is very quickly opaque and therefore it is difficult to see the data clusters. Most of the work done about Parallel Coordinates is to find techniques to reduce the output’s cluttering. The Parallel Coordinates plots in ROOT have been implemented as a new plotting option “PARA” in the TTree::Draw()method. To demonstrate how the Parallel Coordinates works in ROOT we will use the tree produced by the following “pseudo C++” code:; void parallel_example() {; TNtuple *nt = new TNtuple(""nt"",""Demo ntuple"",""x:y:z:u:v:w:a:b:c"");; for (Int_t i=0; i<3000; i++) ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Cluttered output produced when all the tree events are plotted. If the 24000 events are plotted as solid lines and no special techniques are used to clarify the picture, the result is the previous picture which is very cluttered and useless. To improve the readability of the Parallel Coordinates output and to explore interactively the data set, many techniques are available. We have implemented a few in ROOT. First of all, in order to show better where the clusters on the various axes are, a 1D histogram is associated to each axis. These histograms (one per axis) are filled according to the number of lines passing through the bins. The histogram’s axis can be represented with colors or as bar charts. These histograms can be represented which colors (get from a palette according to the bin contents) or as bar charts. Both representations can be cumulated on the same plot. This technique allows seeing clearly where the clusters are on an individual axis but it does not give any hints about the correlations between the axes.; Avery simple technique allows to make the clusters appearing: Instead of painting solid lines we paint dotted lines. The cluttering of each individual line is reduced and the clusters show clearly as we can see on the next figure. The spacing between the dots is a parameter which can be adjusted in order to get the best results. Using dotted lines is a very simple method to reduce the cluttering. Interactivity is a very important aspect of the Parallel Coordinates plots. To really explore the data set it is essential to act directly with the events and the axes. For instance, changing the axes order may show clusters which were not visible in a different order. On the next figure the axes order has been changed interactively.

To pursue further data sets exploration we have implemented the possibility to define selections interactively. A selection is a set of ranges combined together. Within a selection, ranges along the same axis are combined with logical OR, and ranges on different axes with logical AND. A selection is displayed on top of the complete data set using its own color. Only the events fulfilling the selection criteria (ranges) are displayed. Ranges are defined interactively using cursors, like on the first axis on the figure. Several selections can be defined at the same time, each selection having its own color. Selections are set of ranges which can be defined interactively. Several selections can been defined. Each cluster is now clearly visible and the zone with crossing clusters is now understandable whereas, without any selection or with only a single one, it was not easy to understand. Several selections can be defined each of them having its own color. Interactive selections on Parallel Coordinates are a powerful tool because they can be defined graphically on many variables (graphical cuts in ROOT can be defined on two variables only) which allow a very accurate events filtering. Selections allow making precise events choices: a single outlying event is clearly visible when the lines are displayed as “solid” therefore it is easy to make cuts in order to eliminate one single event from a selection. Such selection (to filter one single event) on a scatter plot would be much more difficult. Selections allow to easily filter one single event.

By default 50 rows are shown before TTree::Scan pauses and ask you to press the Enter key to see the next 50 rows. You can change the default number of rows to be shown before <CR> via mytree->SetScanfield(maxrows) where maxrows is 50 by default. If maxrows is set to 0 all rows of the Tree are shown.

For maximum flexibility and minimize memory allocation, the coordinate system classes are templated on the scalar type. To avoid exposing templated parameter to the users, typedefs are defined for all types of vectors based on doubles. See in the examples for all the possible types of vector classes, which can be constructed by users with the available coordinate system types.; 13.12.1.4 Coordinate System Tag; The 2D and 3D points and vector classes can be associated to a tag defining the coordinate system. This can be used to distinguish between vectors of different coordinate systems like global or local vectors. The coordinate system tag is a template parameter of the ROOT::Math::DisplacementVector3D and ROOT::Math::PositionVector3D (and also for 2D classes). A default tag exists for users who do not need this functionality, ROOT::Math::DefaultCoordinateSystemTag.; 13.12.1.5 Transformations; The transformations are modeled using simple (non-template) classes, using double as the scalar type to avoid too large numerical errors. The transformations are grouped in rotations (in 3 dimensions), Lorentz transformations and Poincare transformations, which are translation/rotation combinations. Each group has several members which may model physically equivalent transformations but with different internal representations. Transformation classes can operate on all type of vectors by using the operator ()or the operator * and the transformations can be combined via the operator *. The available transformations are:. 3D rotation classes; rotation described by a 3x3 matrix (ROOT::Math::Rotation3D); rotation described by Euler angles (ROOT::Math::EulerAngles); rotation described by a direction axis and an angle (ROOT::Math::AxisAngle); rotation described by a quaternion (ROOT::Math::Quaternion); optimized rotation around x (ROOT::Math::RotationX), y (ROOT::Math::RotationY) and z (ROOT::Math::RotationZ) and described by just one angle.; 3D tran",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

If necessary, users can always reformulate the calculation in 2 parts, a real one and an imaginary part. Although, a linear equation involving complex numbers will take about a factor of 8 more computations, the alternative of introducing a set of complex classes in this non-template library would create a major maintenance challenge.; Another choice was to fill in both the upper-right corner and the bottom-left corner of a symmetric matrix. Although most algorithms use only the upper-right corner, implementation of the different matrix views was more straightforward this way.

Next figure shows the CPU time for these four operations as a function of the matrix size:. A*B The execution time is measured for the sum of A * Bsym, Bsym* A and A * B. Notice the matrix_size3 dependence of execution time. CLHEP results are hampered by a poor implementation of symmetric matrix multiplications. For instance, for general matrices of size 100x100, the time is 0.015 sec. while A * Bsym takes 0.028 sec and Bsym* A takes 0.059 sec. Both GSL and ROOT v4.0 can be setup to use the hardware-optimized multiplication routines of the BLAS libraries. It was tested on a G4 PowerPC. The improvement becomes clearly visible around sizes of (50x50) were the execution speed improvement of the Altivec processor becomes more significant than the overhead of filling its pipe. \(A^{-1}\) Here, the time is measured for an in-place matrix inversion. Except for ROOT v3.10, the algorithms are all based on an LUfactorization followed by forward/back-substitution. ROOT v3.10 is using the slower Gaussian elimination method. The numerical accuracy of the CLHEP routine is poor:. up to 6x6 the numerical imprecise Cramer multiplication is hard-coded. For instance, calculating U=H*H-1, where H is a (5x5) Hilbert matrix, results in off-diagonal elements of \(10^{-7}\) instead of the \(10^{-13}\) using an LUaccording to Crout.; scaling protection is non-existent and limits are hard-coded, as a consequence inversion of a Hilbert matrix for sizes>(12x12) fails. In order to gain speed the CLHEP algorithm stores its permutation info of the pivots points in a static array, making multi-threading not possible. GSL uses LU decomposition without the implicit scaling of Crout.

This is convenient if you want to store objects of different classes in the same collection and execute the method of the same name on all members of the collection. For example, the list of graphics primitives are in a ROOT collection called TList. When the canvas is drawn, the Paint method is executed on the entire collection. Each member may be a different class, and if the Paint method is not implemented, TObject::Paint will be executed.; 15.1.3 Input/Output; The TObject::Write method is the interface to the ROOT I/O system. It streams the object into a buffer using the Streamer method. It supports cycle numbers and automatic schema evolution. See “Input/Output”.; 15.1.4 Paint/Draw; These graphics methods are defaults; their implementation in TObject does not use the graphics subsystem. The TObject::Draw method is simply a call to AppendPad. The Paint method is empty. The default is provided so that one can call Paint in a collection. The method GetDrawOption returns the draw option that was used when the object was drawn on the canvas. This is especially relevant with histograms and graphs.; 15.1.5 Clone/DrawClone; Two useful methods are Clone and DrawClone. The Clone method takes a snapshot of the object with the Streamer and creates a new object. The DrawClone method does the same thing and in addition draws the clone.; 15.1.6 Browse; This method is called if the object is browse-able and is to be displayed in the object browser. For example the TTree implementation of Browse, calls the Browse method for each branch. The TBranch::Browse method displays the name of each leaf.

The tool to create Reflex dictionaries was a Python script called genreflex and was very successful in the user community. Even if version 6 has only one type of dictionaries, cling dictionaries, a re-implementation of genreflex is provided. More precisely, in ROOT6, genreflex is nothing but a wrapper around rootcling, which offers an identical CLI and behaviour to the old Python tool. The input to genreflex is a C++ header file, a set of switches and a selection XML file. The output, as for rootcling, is a C++ dictionary source and a pcm files. An exhaustive documentation of the CLI switches of genreflex can be inspected with the genreflex --help command.; The entity corresponding to the LinkDef file for genreflex is the selection XML file, also called selection XML or simply selection file. A selection XML file allows to describe a list of classes for which the dictionaries are to be created. In addition, it allows to specify properties of classes or data members, without the need to add comments in the source code. This is of primary importance when dictionaries must be created for classes residing in code which cannot be modified. For a complete description of the structure of the selection XML files and the way in which attributes can be set, refer to the genreflex --help command.; It is important to observe that selection XML files can be used in presence of rootcling invocations instead of LinkDef files.; 15.6.1 The ROOT::Meta::Selection namespace; Not only LinkDef and selection files allow to select the classes for which the dictionaries must be created: a third method is available.

By overriding the following TObject member functions, you can change the behavior of objects in collections:. IsEqual()is used by the FindObject()collection method. By default, IsEqual() compares the two object pointers.; Compare()returns -1, 0 or 1 depending if the object is smaller, equal or larger than the other object. By default, a TObject has not a valid Compare() method.; IsSortable()returns true if the class is sort able (i.e. if it has a valid Compare() method). By default, a TObject is not sort able.; Hash()returns a hash value. It needs to be implemented if an object has to be stored in a collection using a hashing technique, like THashTable, THashList and TMap. By default, Hash() returns the address of the object.

Index validity is always checked (if you are 100% sure and maximum performance is needed you can use UnCheckedAt() instead of At() or operator[]).

In the end, the compiler leaves it the user to ensure that the types are correct. This only leaves the other alternative: creating a new class each time a new (container organization) / (contained object) combination is needed. To say the least this could be very tedious. Most people faced with this choice would, for each type of container:; Define the class leaving a dummy name for the contained object type. When a particular container was needed, copy the code and then do a global search and replace for the contained class. C++ has a built in template scheme that effectively does just this. For example:; template<class T>; class ArrayContainer {; private:; T *member[10];; ...; };; This is an array container with a 10-element array of pointers to T, it could hold up to 10 T objects.

The biggest one containing all others defines the “world” of the model. We will often call this master reference system (MARS).

Any volume is an un-positioned object in the sense that it defines only a local frame (matching the one of its shape). In order to fully define the mother-daughter relationship between two volumes one has to specify how the daughter will be positioned inside. This is accomplished by defining a local geometrical transformation of the daughter with respect to the mother coordinate system. These transformations will be subsequently used in the example.; Q: “I see the lines defining the top level volume as in the previous example, but what about the other volumes named REPLICA and ROOT?”; A: You will also notice that several other volumes are created by using lines like:; TGeoVolume *someVolume = gGeoManager->MakeXXX(""someName"",; ptrMedium, /* parameters coresponding to XXX ...*/); In the method above XXX represent some shape name (Box, Tube, etc.). This is just a simple way of creating a volume having a given shape in one-step (see also section: “Creating and Positioning Volumes”). As for REPLICA and ROOT volumes, they are just some virtual volumes used for grouping and positioning together other real volumes. See “Positioned Volumes (Nodes)”. The same structure represented by (a real or) a virtual volume can be replicated several times in the geometry.; Q: “Fine, so probably the real volumes are the ones composing the letters R, O and T. Why one have to define so many volumes to make an R?”; A: Well, in real life some objects have much more complex shapes that an R. The modeller cannot just know all of them; the idea is to make a complex object by using elementary building blocks that have known shapes (called primitive shapes).

The relative geometrical transformation as well as a copy number must be specified. When positioned, a volume becomes a node of its container and a new object of the class TGeoNode is automatically created. This method is therefore the key element for the creation of a hierarchical link between two volumes. As it will be described further on in this document, there are few other methods performing similar actions, but let us keep things simple for the time being. In addition, notice that there are some visualization-related calls in the example followed by a final TGeoVolume::Draw()call for the top volume. These are explained in details in the section “Visualization Settings and Attributes”. At this point, you will probably like to see how this geometry looks like.

Looking at our simple world example, one can see that for creating volumes one needs to create tracking media before. The way to proceed for those not interested in performing tracking with external MC’s is to define and use only one dummy tracking medium as in the example (or a NULL pointer).; 18.2.4 User Interface for Handling Materials and Media; The TGeoManager class contains the API for accessing and handling defined materials:; TGeoManager::GetMaterial(name);; 18.3 Shapes; Shapes are geometrical objects that provide the basic modeling functionality.

The modeller currently provides a set of 20 basic shapes, which we will call primitives. It also provides a special class allowing the creation of shapes as a result of Boolean operations between primitives. These are called composite shapes and the composition operation can be recursive (combined composites). This allows the creation of a quite large number of different shape topologies and combinations. You can have a look and run the tutorial: http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/geodemo.C.html. Primitive Shapes - the general inheritance scheme. Shapes are named objects and all primitives have constructors like:; TGeoXXX(const char *name,<type> param1,<type> param2, ...);; TGeoXXX(<type> param1,<type> param2, ...);; Naming shape primitive is mandatory only for the primitives used in Boolean composites (see “Composite Shapes”). For the sake of simplicity, we will describe only the constructors in the second form.; 18.3.1 Units; The length units used in the geometry are arbitrary. However, there are certain functionalities that work with the assumption that the used lengths are expressed in centimeters. This is the case for shape capacity or volume weight computation. The same is valid when using the ROOT geometry as navigator for an external transport MC package (e.g. GEANT) via the VMC interface.; Other units in use: All angles used for defining rotation matrices or some shape parameters are expressed in degrees. Material density is expressed in [g/cm3].; 18.3.2 Primitive Shapes; 18.3.2.1 Boxes - TGeoBBox Class; Normally a box has to be built only with 3 parameters: DX,DY,DZ representing the half-lengths on X, Y and Z-axes. In this case, the origin of the box will match the one of its reference frame and the box will range from: -DX to DX on X-axis, from -DY to DY on Y and from -DZ to DZ on Z.

Building a complete geometry in this style is virtually possible but highly not recommended.; 18.3.3.1 The Structure of Composite Shapes; A composite shape can always be looked as the result of a Boolean operation between only two shape components. All information identifying these two components as well as their positions with respect to the frame of the composite is represented by an object called Boolean node. A composite shape has a pointer to such a Boolean node. Since the shape components may also be composites, they will also contain binary Boolean nodes branching out other two shapes in the hierarchy. Any such branch ends-up when the final leaves are no longer composite shapes, but basic primitives. The figure shows the composite shapes structure. The composite shapes structure. Suppose that A, B, C and D represent basic shapes, we will illustrate how the internal representation of few combinations look like. We do this only for understanding how to create them in a proper way, since the user interface for this purpose is in fact very simple. We will ignore for the time being the positioning of components. The definition of a composite shape takes an expression where the identifiers are shape names. The expression is parsed and decomposed in 2 sub-expressions and the top-level Boolean operator. Union: A+B+C. Just to illustrate the Boolean expression parsing and the composite shape structure, let’s take a simple example. We will describe the union of A, B and C. Both union operators are at the same level. Since:; A+B+C = (A+B)+C = A+(B+C); The first(+) is taken as separator, hence the expression split in: A and (B+C). A Boolean node of type TGeoUnion(""A"",""B+C"") is created.

This looks much nicer, is it? In fact, it is and it is not. Of course, we managed to get rid of the ‘unnecessary’ volume C in our geometry, but we end-up with a more flat structure for D,E and F (more daughters inside).

One of these is that the structure has to be replicated in several parts of the geometry, or it may simply happen that they really represent a single object, too complex to be described by a primitive shape.; Usually handling structures like these can be easily done by positioning all components in the same container volume, then positioning the container itself. However, there are many practical cases when defining such a container is not straightforward or even possible without generating overlaps with the rest of the geometry. There are few ways out of this:. Defining the container for the structure as “overlapping” (see also "" Overlapping Volumes ""); Representing the container as a composite shape - the Boolean union of all components (see also "" Composite Shapes ""); Using an assembly volume - this will be described in the following. The first two approaches have the disadvantage of penalizing the navigation performance with a factor increasing more than linear of the number of components in the structure.

Due to the self-containment of assemblies, they are very practical to use when a container is hard to define due to possible overlaps during positioning. For instance, it is very easy creating honeycomb structures. A very useful example for creating and using assemblies can be found at: http://root.cern.ch/root/html/examples/assembly.C.html.; Creation of an assembly is very easy: one has just to create a TGeoVolumeAssembly object and position the components inside as for any volume:; TGeoVolume *vol = new TGeoVolumeAssembly(name);; vol->AddNode(vdaughter1, cpy1, matrix1);; vol->AddNode(vdaughter2, cpy2, matrix2);; Note that components cannot be declared as “overlapping” and that a component can be an assembly volume. For existing flat volume structures, one can define assemblies to force a hierarchical structure therefore optimizing the performance. Usage of assemblies does NOT imply penalties in performance, but in some cases, it can be observed that it is not as performing as bounding the structure in a container volume with a simple shape. Choosing a normal container is therefore recommended whenever possible.

This was designed to minimize memory requirements and optimize performance of point/vector master-to-local and local-to-master computation. We need to have in mind that a transformation in TGeo has two major use-cases. The first one is for defining the placement of a volume with respect to its container reference frame. This frame will be called ‘master’ and the frame of the positioned volume - ‘local’.

The second use case is the computation of the global transformation of a given object in the geometry. Since the geometry is built as ‘volumes-inside-volumes’, the global transformation represents the pile-up of all local transformations in the corresponding branch. Once a given object in the hierarchy becomes the current one, the conversion from master to local coordinates or the other way around can be done from the manager class.; A general homogenous transformation is defined as a 4x4 matrix embedding a rotation, a translation and a scale.

A state is determined by any combination of the position \(\vec{r}\) and direction \(\vec{n}\) with respect to the world reference frame. The direction \(\vec{n}\) must be a unit vector having as components the director cosines. The full classification of a given state will provide the following information: the deepest physical node containing the position vector, the distance to the closest boundary along the direction vector, the next physical node after propagating the current point with this distance and the safety distance to the nearest boundary. This information allows the propagation of particles inside a detector geometry by taking into account both geometrical and physical constraints.; We will hereby describe the user interface of TGeo to access tracking functionality. This allows either developing a tracker for simple navigation within a given geometry, either interfacing to an external tracking engine such as GEANT. Note that the abstract interface for external trackers can be found in $ROOTSYS/vmc folder and it can be used to run GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA-based simulations (*) by using directly a geometry described with ROOT.; The interface methods related to tracking are incorporated into TGeoManager class and implemented in the navigator class TGeoNavigator. In order to be able to start tracking, one has to define the initial state providing the starting point \(\vec{r_0}\) and direction \(\vec{n_0}\) . There are several ways of doing that.; 18.5.1 TGeoNavigator Class; One geometry may have several independent navigators to query to localize points or compute distances.

This has nothing to do with the number of nodes, since the same node can be found on different branches. In other words, the number of states corresponds to the number of nodes in the expanded geometry tree. Since unfortunately this expansion from logical to physical hierarchy cannot be stored on regular basis due to the large size of the latter, one cannot directly assign state numbers. If the size of the expansion proves however to be small enough (less than about 50 million objects), a parallel structure storing these state indices is built and stored in memory. In such case each state automatically gets an index that can be retrieved after any state initialization. These indices can prove to be quite useful for being able to keep track of the navigation history and force certain states. Let’s illustrate how this works with a simple example:; Suppose we have a simple geometry with a volume B positioned twice inside a container A. Then A is positioned twice in a top container T. The complete list of logical nodes is: T_1, A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2. On the other hand we will have more states than logical nodes:; /T_1- 1 state at level = 0; /T_1/A_1,/T_1/A_2- 2 states at level = 1; /T_1/A_1/B_1,/T_1/A_1/B_2,/T_1/A_2/B_1,/T_1/A_2/B_2 - 4 states at level = 2; All these states will get automatic numbers, starting with 0 corresponding to the top-level state and ending with an integer corresponding to Ntotal_states-1. The mapping from a given logical node to a state number is generally not possible, as for the node B_1 that appears as current node for 2 different states. The numbering order of states is therefore not important, but it can be used as in the following lines:. gGeoManager->InitTrack(pt,dir); // anything to initialize a state; Int_t istate = gGeoManager->GetCurrentNodeId(); // in fact state Id; {; //... code changing the current state; }; gG",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html
https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html:979291,Usability,simpl,simple,979291," The number of possible different states of the modeller corresponds to the number of different objects/paths in the geometry. This has nothing to do with the number of nodes, since the same node can be found on different branches. In other words, the number of states corresponds to the number of nodes in the expanded geometry tree. Since unfortunately this expansion from logical to physical hierarchy cannot be stored on regular basis due to the large size of the latter, one cannot directly assign state numbers. If the size of the expansion proves however to be small enough (less than about 50 million objects), a parallel structure storing these state indices is built and stored in memory. In such case each state automatically gets an index that can be retrieved after any state initialization. These indices can prove to be quite useful for being able to keep track of the navigation history and force certain states. Let’s illustrate how this works with a simple example:; Suppose we have a simple geometry with a volume B positioned twice inside a container A. Then A is positioned twice in a top container T.

This provides the fastest validation check for most common coding or design mistakes. As soon as the geometry is successfully closed, one should draw it starting from the top-level volume:; //... code for geometry building; root[] gGeoManager->CloseGeometry();; root[] gGeoManager->GetMasterVolume()->Draw();; Doing this ensures that the original top-level volume of the geometry is drawn, even if another volume is currently the geometry root. OK, I suppose you already did that with your simple geometry and immediately noticed a new ROOT canvas popping-up and having some more or less strange picture inside. Here are few questions that might come:; Q: “The picture is strangely rotated; where are the coordinate axes?”; A: If drawn in a new canvas, any view has some default viewpoint, center of view and size. One can then perform mouse/keyboard actions to change them:. Mouse left-click and drag will rotate the view;; Some keys can be pressed when the view canvas is selected: J/K zoom/un-zoom, U/I move up/down, L/H move left/right. The coordinate axes display as well as changing top or side viewpoints can be activated from the TView context menu: right-click on the picture when no object is selected;. Q: “Every line is black! I cannot figure out what is what…”; A: Volumes can have different colors (those known by ROOT of course). Think at using them after each volume creation: myvolume->SetLineColor(Int_t color); otherwise everything is by default black.; Q: “The top volume of my geometry is a box but I see on",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Combined with visibility settings per volume, these can tune quite well what should appear on the screen. However, there are situations when users want to see a volume branch displayed down to the maximum depth, keeping at the same time a limitation or even suppressing others. In order to accomplish that, one should use the volume attribute: Visible daughters. By default, all daughters of all volumes are displayed if there is no limitation related with their level depth with respect to the top drawn volume.; 18.7.3 Ray Tracing; Ray tracing is a quite known drawing technique based on tracking rays from the eye position through all pixels of a view port device. The pixel color is derived from the properties of the first crossed surface, according some illumination model and material optical properties. While there are currently existing quite sophisticated ray tracing models, TGeo is currently using a very simple approach where the light source is matching the eye position (no shadows or back-tracing of the reflected ray). In future we are considering providing a base class in order to be able to derive more complex models.; Due to the fact that the number of rays that have to be tracked matches the size in pixels of the pad, the time required by this algorithm is proportional to the pad size. On the other hand, the speed is quite acceptable for the default ROOT pad size and the images produced by using this technique have high quality. Since the algorithm is practically using all navigation features, producing ray-traced pictures is also a geometry validation check. Ray tracing can be activated at volume level as the normal Draw(). Ray-traced view in a pad. myVolume->Raytrace(); Once ray-tracing a view, this can be zoomed or rotated as a usual one.

The returned value is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here.; After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by TGeoManager::FindNextDaughterBoundary(). This computes the distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by using volume voxelization. The algorithm is efficient in average only in case the number of daughters is greater than 4. For fewer nodes, a simple loop is performed and the minimum distance (from a point outside each shape) is taken and compared to the maximum allowed step. The step value is again updated if step<stepmax .; A special case is when the current node is declared as possibly overlapping with something else. If this is the case, the distance is computed for all possibly overlapping candidates, taking into account the overlapping priorities (see also: "" Overlapping volumes "").; The global matrix describing the next crossed physical node is systematically computed in case the value of the proposed step is negative. In this case, one can subsequently call TGeoManager::ComputeNormalFast() to get the normal vector to the crossed surface, after propagating the current point with the TGeoManager::GetStep() value. This propagation can be done like:; Double_t *current_point = gGeoManager->GetCurrentPoint();; Double_t *current_dir = gGeoManager->GetCurrentDirection();; for (Int_t i=0; i<3; i++); current_point[i] += step * current_dir[I];; Note: The method TGeoManager::FindNextB",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

If you work at CERN, you can use the installation available on afs. Otherwise, you will want to build from source, as PyROOT is not build by default in the binaries distributed from the ROOT project site. If you download the ROOT binaries, take care to download and install the Python distribution from http://www.python.org/ against which they were built.; 19.1.4.1 Environment Settings; ROOT installations with the build of PyROOT enabled are available from the CERN afs cell /afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>. To use them, simply modify your shell environment accordingly. For Unix:; export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PYTHONDIR/bin:$PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH; For Windows:; set PATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONDIR%/bin;%PATH%; set PYTHONPATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONPATH%; where $ROOTSYS should be set to /afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>, and PYTHONDIR to /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Python/2.3.4/<platform> with <version> and <platform> as appropriate.

The following sections explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch out for.; 19.1.5.1 Access to ROOT Classes; Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06, this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the auto-loading mechanism through so-called rootmap files. Effectively, this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly available for import. For example:; from ROOT import TCanvas # available at startup; c = TCanvas(). from ROOT import TLorentzVector # triggers auto-load of libPhysics; l = TLorentzVector(); Although it is not recommended, a simple way of working with PyROOT is doing a global import:; from ROOT import *. c = TCanvas(); l = TLorentzVector(); Keeping the ROOT namespace (“import ROOT”), or only importing from ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will always be cleaner and clearer:; import ROOT. c = ROOT.TCanvas(); l = ROOT.TLorentzVector(); Since it is foreseen that most people will use the simple approach anyway, the request to copy all from module ROOT will not actually result in copying all ROOT classes into the current namespace. Instead, classes will still be bound (and possibly loaded) on an as-needed basis.

Be careful in their use, because Python already has types called “string” and “list.”; In order to understand how to get access to a templated class, think of the general template as a meta class. By instantiating the meta class with the proper parameters, you get an actual class, which can then be used to create object instances.

An example session should make this clear:; >>> from ROOT import *; >>> gROOT # directly available; <ROOT.TROOT object at 0x399c30>; >>> gMinuit # library not yet loaded: not available; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in ?; NameError: name 'gMinuit' is not defined; >>> TMinuit # use of TMinuit class forces auto-loading; <class '__main__.TMinuit'>; >>> gMinuit # now gMinuit is available; <__main__.TMinuit object at 0x1458c70>; >>> not not gMinuit # but it is the null pointer, until set; False; >>> g = TMinuit(); >>> not not gMinuit; True; It is also possible to create globals interactively, either by executing a Cling macro, or by a call to gROOT.ProcessLine(). These globals are made available in the same way: either use them directly after creation in ‘from ROOT import *’ more, or get them from the ROOT namespace after an ‘import ROOT’.; As of 5.08, the behaviour of ROOT globals is the same as python globals, which is sometimes counterintuitive: since they are references, they can be changed only if done so di",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Differences occur mainly because of differences in the respective languages: C++ is much harder to parse, but once parsed, it is much easier to optimize. Consequently, individual calls to ROOT are typically faster from PyROOT, whereas loops are typically slower.; When programming in Python, the modus operandi is to consider performance generally “good enough” on the outset, and when it turns out that, it is not good enough; the performance critical part is converted into C/C++ in an extension module. The school of thought where pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this path.; Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use TLorentzVector instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing, make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may be gained by using psyco, see the next link: http://psyco.sourceforge.net, a Python just in time compiler (JIT). Note, however, that psyco is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since psyco optimizes Python, not PyROOT calls; it generally does not improve performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls. Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot.; Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that member function and an association of this method with 'self'. Furthermore, a temporary object is created during this process that is discarded after the method call. In inner loops, it may be worth your while (up to 30%), to short-cut this process by looking up a",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Some compilers, for example gcc version 2.95.2, may not allow the (void(*) (void*))s cast and just stop if Thread0 is not static. On the other hand, if Thread0 is static, no compiler warnings are generated at all. Because the 'this' pointer is passed in 'arg' in the call to Thread0(void *arg), you have access to the instance of the class even if Thread0 is static. Using the 'this' pointer, non static members can still be read and written from Thread0, as long as you have provided Getter and Setter methods for these members. For example:; Bool_t state = arg->GetRunStatus();; arg->SetRunStatus(state);; Second, the pointer to the current instance of Myclass, i.e. (void*) this, has to be passed as first argument of the threaded function Thread0 (C++ member functions internally expect this pointer as first argument to have access to class members of the same instance). pthreads are made for simple C functions and do not know about Thread0 being a member function of a class. Thus, you have to pass this information by hand, if you want to access all members of the Myclass instance from the Thread0 function.; Note: Method Thread0 cannot be a virtual member function, since the cast of Thread0 to void(*) in the TThread constructor may raise problems with C++ virtual function table.

Opening of the connection to the system; Definition of main frame (top level window); Creation of widgets as children of the top-level frame; assign them desired properties following the steps:; Create a new widget passing its parent in the constructor; Connect widget’s signals with desired slots to ensure desired functionality; Define widget’s layout and add it to the parent list of children; Set main window attributes; Map all sub windows; Initialize the layout algorithm via Resize(GetDefaultSize()) method; Map the main frame; Execution of the even-processing loop. 25.4.1 A Standalone Version; As usual a standalone program in C++ has to contain a main() function - the starting point for the application execution. In this case it is better to separate the program code creating a program header file example2a.h with the MyMainFrame class declaration and example2a.cxx- with the class methods implementation. To run our simple example as a standalone application we need to create in addition an object of class TApplication. It will make a correct initialization of the dictionaries if it is not yet done. It will be responsible for holding everything together and to handle all events in the application. Its environment provides an interface to the ROOT graphics system and by calling the Run() method the event loop starts and the application program is waiting for the user action. The application exits only if the top level window is not closed. Two header files are used in addition: TApplication.h - for the class TApplication and TGClient.h that is used to make initial connection to the graphics system. The class TApplication must be instantiated only once in any given application. The original list of argument options can be retrieved via the Argc() and Argv() methods.; Note: to have signals/slots working we need to create a dictionary for the class MyMainFrame, i.e. we create the file ex2aLinkDef.h containing the line:; #pragma link C++ class MyMa",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Almost all GUI elements are widgets. A button is a widget, a menu item is a widget, a scrollbar is a widget, and a complete dialog box is a widget too. Some widgets may have sub widgets. For example, a dialog box can contain buttons, text fields, a combo-box, etc.; On the screen widgets look like rectangular areas with special behaviors. In terms of the object-oriented programming we can define a widget in ROOT as an object of a class deriving from TGObject.; This section presents all currently supported widgets in ROOT and their most useful methods. All of them can be considered as building blocks for an application, and most of them can be found in dialogs. Provided snippets of the code will give you practical guidelines where and how to use certain widgets. The macro $ROOTSYS/tutorials/gui/guitest.C contains the complete source code. Widgets created by ROOT GUI classes. Any custom widget can be created by sub classing existing widgets. To achieve a better understanding of the widgets’ properties they are separated by their type and their inheritance. As all of them inherit from TGObject and most from TGWidget, these base classes are described first.; 25.5.1 TGObject; TGObject is the base class for all ROOT GUI classes. It inherits from TObject. The two data members of this class contain important information about X11/Win32 window identifier and the connection to the host’s graphics system. Every GUI element, which derives from TGObject has access to the TGClient via the data member fClient of TGObject. TGClient creates the connection with the host’s graphics system and sets up the complete graphics system for all widgets.; 25.5.2 TGWidget; The widgets base class TGWidget is typically us",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

WantFocus() - returns kTRUE if the flag kWidgetWantFocus is set.; 25.5.3 TGWindow; TGWindow is a ROOT GUI window base class. It inherits from TGObject and TGFrame derives from it. The application does not use it directly. It creates and registers a new window within the system. This window has common characteristics: existing parent, location, size in height and width (it has a default minimum size 1, 1 under which it cannot shrink), border with particular view, state, specific attributes. If there are no specified arguments their values will be taken from the parent. It receives events from the window system and can paint a representation of itself on the screen. 25.5.4 Frames; Most of the frame classes are mainly created for arranging widgets in a window. The class TGFrame is a subclass of TGWindow providing additional window characteristics and overriding some methods of TGWindow. It is a base class for the simple widgets as buttons, labels, etc. Its only purpose is to draw a frame around widgets that do not have a frame of their own. The main groups of TGFrame member functions are:. Window’s functions: DoRedraw(), DeleteWindow(), Activate(), etc.; Geometry functions: Move(), Resize(), SetSize(), etc.; Graphics handlers: ChangeBackground(), ChangeOptions(), etc.; Mouse and keyboard functions: HandleButton(), HandleFocusChange(), HandleKey(), HandleMotion(), etc.; Event handlers: HandleEvent(), ProcessEvent(), GetSender(), SendMessage(),ProcessMessage(), GetLastClick(), etc. The GUI classes hierarchy. Ones of TGFrame member functions provide direct functionality; others - will be overridden by TGFrame subclasses to ensure particular widget’s functionality. There are two constructors provided in TGFrame class. One creates a frame using an externally created window:; TGFrame(TGClient *c,Window_t id,const TGWindow *parent = 0);; For example, it can register the root window (called by TGClient), or ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

You can change it to be centered or right aligned if you use TGGroupFrame::kCenter or TGGroupFrame::kRight as a parameter. Be conservative in the use of borders because of the potential for clutter. Do not place them around single entry fields, single combo boxes, list boxes and groups of command buttons. The design of these widgets provides them with a border. The picture above provides kind of borders to avoid.; 25.6 Layout Management; The layout process is an integral part of any GUI. When you create a simple message window, laying out its few buttons and text widgets is quite simple. However, this process becomes increasingly difficult if you have to implement large GUI’s with many widgets that should behave properly when the GUI is resized or uses a different font type or size. Layout management is the process of determining the size and position of every widget in a container.; A layout manager is an object that performs layout management for the widgets within a container. You already know that when adding a component (child widget) to a container (parent widget) you can provide alignment hints (or rely on the default ones). These hints are used by the layout manager to correctly position the widgets in the container. The TGLayoutManager is an abstract class providing the basic layout functionality.

The Graphical User Interface is as a bridge between the user and the program - it provides methods to detect the user actions and instruments that do something as a reaction of these actions. The user communicates with an application through the window system. The window system reports interaction events to the application. The application in turn forwards them to the currently active window. The objects/widgets receive the events and react to them according to the application functionality. The signals/slot communication mechanism is an advanced object communication concept; it largely replaces the concept of callback functions to handle actions in GUI’s. Signals and slots are just like any object-oriented methods implemented in C++. The objects are the instances of classes that don’t know anything about each other. They interact and allow method calls of other object’s methods. The idea is simple: any object can send out (emit) a signal in certain situations saying that something happened. This is all it does to communicate and it does not know whether anything is interested in this information. On the other side there might be an object waiting for that signal and ready to react to it. This object disposes of special instruments to listen to the sent out signals.

Each option acts as a switch and can be either “on” or “off”. It is never changed in contents. Checkboxes differ from radio buttons in that they permit selection of more than one alternative. Each box can be switched on or off independently. These buttons can be used alone or grouped in sets. It is good practice to provide default settings for check boxes whenever it is possible. This can be done by:; SetState(EButtonState state); The parameter state can be one of kButtonUp, kButtonDown, kButtonEngaged, kButtonDisabled.; Check boxes can be used to affect other controls. The contents of a list can, for example, be filtered by setting a check box. In any case, use a check box only when both states of a choice are clearly opposite and unambiguous. If opposite states are not clear, it is better to use two radio buttons.; Choice description, i.e. check box label, must be clear, meaningful, fully spelled out, and displayed in mixed-type text. Whenever the use of a given button is inappropriate, for whatever reason, that button should be disabled:; button->SetState(kButtonDisabled);; Never make a button appear and disappear.; In general, option buttons should not offer more than eight choices. If the number of choices exceeds this maximum, it is better to use a multiple selection list box.; The method IsToggleButton() gives the information whether a radio button or a check button is selected. An option button can be set or unset via its method PSetState(EButtonState state).; The method HandleKey(event) is called when the defined hotkey is hit for any button. It sets the selected option button or clicks the selected text button and invokes its defined action.; 25.8.2 Text Entries; A TGTextEntry is a one-line text input widget. It contains text that is entered or modified through the keyboard. This text may be displayed in different way according to the set echo mode.

It should also have a defined character as its unique access key. The second parameter is the popup menu we would like to add. The third one is an object of TGLayoutHints type that defines how the menu title will be laid out in the menu bar. In our example the File and Test menus will be laid out to the left of the menu bar with 4 pixels distance in between, the Help menu - will be laid out to the right.; The menu classes provide a very flexible menu system: you can enable, disable, add or remove menu items dynamically. The method HideEntry(menuID) hides the menu entry (the entry will not be shown in the popup menu). To enable a hidden entry you should call EnableEntry(menuID) method. By default all entries are enabled. The method DisableEntry(menuID) helps you to disable a menu entry - it will appear in sunken relieve. The DeleteEntry(menuID) method will delete the specified entry from the menu.; A few words about the menu design. A menu should be kept consistent and simple. All related items need to be in a popup menu. The cascade menus should be used judiciously. Try to limit them to one, maximum two levels.; There are some rules for naming the menu objects:. Define unique names within a menu; Use capitalized one-word names allowing the quick scan of the menu; Define unique access key for any menu item; Indicate by ellipsis (…) after the title with no space when a menu item will pop-up a dialog box. The proper kind of graphical menus is a critical point to every application success and depends of three main factors:. number of presented items in the menu; how often the menu is used; how often the menu contents may change. 25.8.5 Toolbar.

The choices may be mutually exclusive (a list box with single selection) or not mutually exclusive (a list box with multiple selection). The proper usage of the list boxes is for selecting values, or objects, or setting attributes. You have to create them to display 4 to 8 choices at one time (3 is a required minimum in case of lack of screen space). The list should contain not more than 40 items accessible by scrolling view (vertical scroll bar). If more are required, you should provide a method for using search criteria or scoping the options. The best list boxes use is for textual data or choices. They should be wide enough to display fully all items. When it is not possible, break the long items with ellipsis and provide tool tip that displays the full item text.; The list box widget is represented by TGListBox, TGLBContainer, TGLBEntry and TGTextLBEntry classes. Currently entries are simple text strings (TGTextLBEntry). A TGListBox looks a lot like a TGCanvas. It has a TGViewPort containing a TGLBContainer which contains the entries and it also has a vertical scrollbar which becomes visible if there are more items than fit in the visible part of the container. The TGListBox is user callable. The other classes are service classes of the list box. Here is a sample code showing how to create a list box with ten entries:; // list box widget containing 10 entries; int fFirstEntry = 0, fLastEntry = 10;; char tmp[20];; TGListBox *fListBox = new TGListBox(parent, 90);; for (i = fFirstEntry; i < fLastEntry; i++) {; sprintf(tmp, ""Entry %i"", i+1);; fListBox->AddEntry(tmp, i);; }; fListBox->Resize(150, 80);; parent->AddFrame(fListBox,new TGLayoutHints(kLHintsTop|kLHintsLeft,; 5, 5, 5, 5));; We create the list box widget passing the parent window pointer and giving an ID number.

In addition, the ROOT has fully cross-platform GUI classes and provides all standard components for an application environment with common ‘look and feel’.

This mechanism uses the ROOT dictionary information and the Cling the C++ Interpreter to connect signals to slots methods.; Therefore, all necessary elements for an object-oriented editor design are in place.

See for examples: TH1Editor, TH2Editor.; 25.9.2.3 Base-Class Editors Control; Full control over base-class editors can be achieved by re-implementing virtual method void TGedFrame::ActivateBaseClassEditors(TClass *cl). It is called during each compound editor rebuild and the default implementation simply offers all base-classes to the publishing mechanism.; To prevent inclusion of a base-class into the compound editor, call:; void TGedEditor::ExcludeClassEditor(TClass* class, Bool_t recurse); Pointer to the compound GED-editor is available in TGedFrame‘s data-member:; TGedEditor *fGedEditor; Ordering of base-class editor frames follows the order of the classes in the class hierarchy. This order can be changed by modifying the value of TGedFrame’s data member Int_t fPriority. The default value is 50; smaller values move the frame towards to the top. This priority should be set in the editor constructor.; 25.10 Drag and Drop; Drag and Drop support is introduced for Linux (via Xdnd - the drag and drop protocol for X window system) and for Windows (via Clipboard).

THtml is ROOT’s documentation engine. It can be used to document your classes in a reference guide, and to convert your text or source files to HTML.; 27.1 Reference Guide; The Reference Guide for the ROOT classes at http://root.cern.ch/root/html/ has been generated by ROOT’s THtml class. Just as for ROOT’s classes, it can generate (and update) a reference guide for your classes, too. You document your classes using source code comments. All comments will be automatically put into a <pre></pre> environment to keep the indentation and line length. You can write “raw” HTML by enclosing comments in the keywords Begin_Html and End_Html.; To generate documentation for the class TObject you could run the following commands:; root[] THtml h; root[] h.SetInputDir(""$(ROOTSYS)"");; root[] h.MakeClass(""TObject"");; root[] h.CreateJavascript();; root[] h.CreateStylesheet();; The comments following the first comment of the form //____________________, before any method, is assumed to be the class description.

THtml is ROOT’s documentation engine.

Just as for ROOT’s classes, it can generate (and update) a reference guide for your classes, too. You document your classes using source code comments.

As with any other documentation part, it has to be a continuous block of comments.; Any documented class will have an class index entry in the ClassIndex.html, showing their name with a link to their documentation page and a miniature description.

The documentation also shows the author and a copyright statement. This information is extracted from the source file. The author can be in the format; // Author: Enrico Fermi; for people that have an entry in CERN’s XWho database, and for those who have not:; // Author: Enrico Fermi <mailto:enrico@fnal.gov>; The copyright statement is introduced by the string “* Copyright” inside a comment.; You should read the class reference page at http://root.cern.ch/root/html/THtml.html to learn about all of THtml’s features.; 27.1.1 Product and Module Documentation; For THtml, a product like ROOT is a combination of several modules. It can include user-provided document for both products and modules. The name of the product can be set by calling THtml::SetProductName(). By default, the documentation is searched for in the doc/ subdirectory of the source tree, and in the ../docdirectory, relative to the directory of first source file of a module. This can be set by calls to THtml::SetProductDocDir() and THtml::SetModuleDocPath().; The documentation is generated as an index page with links to further files. This index page includes the file index.txt converted to HTML (via THtml::Convert()) or the file index.html (without conversion to HTML, of course), if any of these files exist. The index page will also contain a list of links to all files in the directory that end on .html or .txt. Files ending on .txt will be converted to HTML before they are copied to the output directory.

https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html:1249806,Usability,guid,guide,1249806,"n .rootrc, as documented in the THtml class reference page http://root.cern.ch/root/html/THtml. The following will enumerate some of the highlights.; 27.4.1 Referencing Documentation for other Libraries; When THtml generates documentation for classes it recognizes all class names known to ROOT. If THtml does not have sources for a class it determines the class’s library name. This has to be set by means of rootmap files, see Library AutoLoading of this User’s Guide. Given the library name, THtml searches for an entry in its map of libraries to documentation URLs. If it finds it, it will create a link to the documentation at that URL for all occurrences of a given class name. One can set the URL ../mylib/ for a library name MyLib by setting Root.Html.MyLib: ../mylib/ or by calling THtml::SetLibURL(""MyLib"", ""../mylib/""). Occurrences of class MyClass of MyLib will now be referenced as ../mylib/MyClass.html.; 27.4.2 Search Engine; THtml can invoke external search engines. The ROOT reference guide sets Root.Html.Search to http://www.google.com/search?q=%s+site%3A%u. Calling THtml::SetSearchStemURL() will set the same. If this URL stem is set, THtml will create search fields in the index pages. It will send the words entered in these search fields as %s in the URL; %u will be replaced by the current document’s path, allowing a site- and directory-specific search.; 27.4.3 ViewCVS; Most code is managed in a version control system like CVS. ViewCVS is a WWW reader interface to the versioning control system that allows e.g. tracking a file’s changes. THtml will reference these pages automatically if the .rootrc variable Root.Html.ViewCVS is set to the URL stem of the ViewCVS. installation. Alternatively, one can call THtml::SetViewCVS().; 27.4.4 Wiki Pages; In some contexts it might be desirable to let users comment on classes, e.g. for suggestions of use or alternatives, details of behavior, and cross references to other relevant classes.
