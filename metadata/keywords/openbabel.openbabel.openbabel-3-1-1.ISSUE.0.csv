If I change ; if (sp->Init(""[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"")); to; if (sp->Init(""[CX3](=O)[OX1]"")); I get for lMatches = 1. For this test I used Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2003 ; C++ Compiler.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1467:607,Security,access,access,607,"Posted from Noel's e-mail:. As I understand it, the idea behind the DataTypes is exactly this, to; distinguish different types of data from each other. Could we have a; particular data type for data fields contained in a molecular file; format, and make it separate from data types that are computed by; OpenBabel?. For example, for an SD file with two data fields, Molecular weight and; NSC, I find the following OBGenericDatas:; ('Comment', 'CORINA 2.61 0041 25.10.2001', 3); ('NSC', '1', 1); ('Molecular weight', '122.03677944', 1)]. (i.e. Attribute, Value, Datatype). However, if I compute the SSSR and access GetFormula, in addition I get:; ('RingData', 'RingData', 8); ('Formula', 'C7H6O2', 1). Note that although RingData has its own datatype, 8, Formula is thrown; in with the data fields from the SD file. In summary, if it makes sense to everyone, could computed datatypes be; kept separate from those that are parsed from the file. Otherwise, it; will be impossible to distinguish data fields from calculated fields. Reported by: @ghutchis.

Example:; $ echo ""CN(=O)=O"" | obgrep 'N.Cl'; CN(=O)=O. There is a bug in parsmarts.cpp, FastSingleMatch(), and; Match(), which assumes that each bond encountered; already has its "".src"" atom mapped, which isn't true; for dot-disconnected SMARTS. That is, after the first; atom is mapped, the Match() functions assume the are; walking a tree in which the back-edges have been; mapped. But if the SMARTS has a dot-disconnection,; there are multiple trees and this assumption isn't true. In the example above, if you write C++ code instead of; using obgrep, with a double loop iterator to get the; atoms (as shown in the OBSmarts class documentation; example), the inner iterator will return an atom Idx of; zero for the chlorine of the ""N.Cl"" SMARTS. Since many; applications assume that the atom Idx's returned are; valid and do ""mol.GetAtom(*i)"", it causes otherwise; correct applications to core dump.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/578:584,Safety,detect,detection,584,"The bond flags OB_TORUP_BOND and OB_TORDOWN_BOND are; used for two unrelated purpuses: To mark cis/trans; around a double bond, and to mark up/down around a; chiral center. These two uses are incompatible, as; illustrated below. The SD file shown has a double bond; and a potential chiral center, but there is no 3D; information, nor is the molecule marked ""chiral"", but; OpenBabel incorrectly deduces chirality for the atom. ; This is because OB deduces cis/trans around the double; bond from the 2D coordinates, and marks the single; bonds ""up"" and ""down"". Then when the chirality; detection goes to work, it notices that one of the; single bonds at the chiral center is marked up/down,; and from that it ""deduces"" that the atom is chiral. Using the SD file below (call it ""ob_bug.sdf""), do the; following:. babel ob_bug.sdf -o smi; C\C=C\[C@@]1CCCCN1; 1 molecule converted. To fix this, a new pair of bond flag needs to be; defined, perhaps OB_CISTRANS_UP and OB_CISTRANS_DOWN,; along with appropriate functions; (bond->SetCisTransUp(), etc.), and then every file; needs to be examined for use of OB_TORUP/DOWN_BOND and; bond->SetUp/Down(), bond->GetUp/Down(), to determine; whether it's a chiral flag, a cis/trans flag, or both. ----------------------.

Babel needs to read records into its internal datastructure before output via conversion.However, its Molfile parser is rather simple and supports few of the more advanced Molfile encoding conventions. In this case, Babel silently drops the critical H0 designator flag (plus a second flag) which lets a Molfile reader distinguish between metal Au and AuH3 with implicit H. So after the pass through Babel, the compound has changed, without any notification, from metal Au to AuH3. That can be a problem.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/632:821,Testability,test,tested,821,"Hi,. The last changes in obprop.cpp fixed the features that I reported earlier, thanks for this. However, it seems that the new version does not cope very well with multimolecule cml files. If there is two or more molecules in the cml file, the obprop outputs the properties of the last molecule twice. Sdf, mol2 etc seem to work ok. This has something to do with the new while structure (that processes all the molecules) in obprop.cpp. The previous structure (for loop, exists in revision 1865) works ok with multimolecule cml files. In the cml file, <cml start tag has something to do with this problem. In case of multimolecule cml, babel writes a reference to cml namescape in cml start tag -> obprop duplicates output. If I remove the namespace reference (just plain <cml>) -> no problems with the obprop output. I tested this on two platforms (linux/solaris) and the problem remained the same. I hope this helps,.

I've been using the pybel readfile method to extract geometries from the output files for various quantum chemistry codes. Unfortunately, when looking at the output files, readfile just hung. The problem seems to be that these readers (e.g NWChemOutputFormat::ReadMolecule) never return ""false"". They just trundle through the output looking for the coordinates block and replacing the old molecule with the new one until they hit the end of; the file. Hence if you call the OBConversion ReadFile method on them, you just get the final geometry and a return state of ""true"". Subsequent calls to the OBConversion Read method just return an empty molecule and the reader returns a state of ""true"". Hence the following block of code in pybel:. obmol = ob.OBMol(); notatend = obconversion.ReadFile(obmol,filename); while notatend:; yield Molecule(obmol); obmol = ob.OBMol(); notatend = obconversion.Read(obmol). just keeps looping forever.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/670:1120,Availability,avail,available,1120,"I would like to report a problem with openbabels function of adding hydrogens to proteins. I used three different versions and hydrogens were added in three different ways. my home open babel (GUI on windows XP, I don't find the version number anywhere) does not recognise double bonds in the protein file and adds to many hydrogens, e.g. in His. Using the pH model will do the correct task (making ammonium and carboxylic ions) only that it is wrong because the bond order was neglected. at work I used a different openbabel (command line on Linux, I am afraid I don't know the version either). it recognised the bonds correctly but it protonated His which is not protonated (neutral, one N and one N-H) in physiological conditions. Arg was correctly protonated. a different babel version kept both Arg and His unprotonated which is wrong again. I am sorry that I could not give more specific information but maybe I could point out that there still seems to be a problem with protonation. A solution may be to save the physiological protonation of the amino acids in phmodel.txt. Thanks for making such a nice program available. Best regards. Felix.

Depending on the value of the LC_NUMERIC locale parameter, OpenBabel can go crazy. More specifically, OpenBabel parses files in a way that is dependent of LC_NUMERIC. This affects the parsing standard files such as element.txt (so that etab goes crazy) as well as the parsing of CML files at least. More specifically, the LC_NUMERIC parameter affects which character is the decimal point: comma or dot. Here is an example program triggering the bug. The element name being in the rightmost column in element.txt, is affected by the mis-parsing of floating-point values in other columns.

In one case, 1 is singlet, in the other case, 0 is singlet. The former is correct and appears to be how the Gaussian file writer interprets this value. Here is the API documentation for OBMol:. void SetTotalSpinMultiplicity 	(unsigned int 	 spin) 	. Set the total spin multiplicity of this molecule to spin (i.e., 0 = singlet (default), 1 = doublet, 2 = triplet, etc.) . unsigned int GetTotalSpinMultiplicity 	() 	. Returns:; the total spin on this molecule (i.e., 1 = singlet, 2 = doublet...) . Returns the total spin multiplicity -- if it has not previously been set it is calculated from the atomic spin multiplicity information assuming the high-spin case (i.e. it simply sums the atomic spins, making no attempt to pair spins). However, if you set atomic spins with OBAtom::SetSpinMultiplicity() you really should set the molecular spin with OBMol::SetTotalSpinMultiplicity() .

Here is the code calling the library functions:. extern ""C"" char *; ob_hillformula (char *molfile); {; ; string tmpStr (molfile);; istringstream molstream (tmpStr);; string molfmla;; OBMol mol;; OBConversion conv;; char *tmpFormula;. conv.SetInAndOutFormats (""MDL"", ""MDL"");; conv.Read (&mol, &molstream);. mol.AddHydrogens (false, false);. molfmla = mol.GetFormula ();. tmpFormula = strdup (molfmla.c_str ());. return (tmpFormula);; }. extern ""C"" double; ob_molweight (char *molfile); {; OBMol mol;; OBConversion conv;; string tmpStr (molfile);; istringstream molstream (tmpStr);; double molweight = 0.0;. conv.SetInAndOutFormats (""MDL"", ""MDL"");. conv.Read (&mol, &molstream);; mol.AddHydrogens (false, false);. molweight = mol.GetMolWt ();. return (molweight);; }. Pretty straightforward. Strangely, it works also when I use the --addformula switch of the 2.1.1 babel.exe downloaded from Sourceforge. regards,. Ernst-G. Schmid. pgchem at tuschehund dot de.

I detect 'disruption' when the OpenBabel generated key (either 'can' or 'inchi' format) differs depending on if I use the molfile or SMILES string supplied by the vendor; it's possible that the vendor has not done the molfile-to-SMILES mapping properly, and that the chirality differs within the vendor DB. So I am passing judgment on the molecules based on graphical visualization provided by PubChem:. http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/edit/. ... and whenever I've spot-checked a disruption by this (unwieldy) mechanism, the chirality of the vendor-supplied SMILES matches that of the key generated by OB via the vendor-supplied molfile, but not the OB key made from the vendor-supplied SMILES (I can't be sure that there is not a bug within the PubChem tool, though). In a few cases, converting to InChI seems to demonstrate indisputable lost of stereochemical information.

In pseudocode, the broken bit of the algorithm is:; WHILE (atom exceeds its maximum valence OR smallest bond angle < 45 degrees) { DELETE THE LONGEST BOND }. The documentation does not mention the minimum bond angle rule. I attach an XYZ file for a molecule that I would expect to have bonds angles less than 45 degrees, and for which ConnectTheDots() returns very strange results. I am not sure where the 45 degree constraint comes from, so although simply removing it solves my specific problem, I am nervous suggesting this as the general solution. Perhaps some people like it? (I've not yet found a reference to it though). However, even if consensus is that there should be a >45 degree rule, the current implementation is flawed: if the two shortest bonds from an atom are at 44 degrees to each other, the algorithm deletes all the longer bonds (longest first) before deleting the offending bond, and you end up with only one bond.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/766:354,Availability,down,down,354,"If an SD File contains a <NAME> field with more than one line, OpenBabel produces invalid SD Files and SMILES files on output. The attached SDF (""methane.sdf"") has such a name. Test it as:. babel methane.sdf -o sdf; babel methane.sdf -o smi. It's not clear whether this should be considered a bug in the output modules, or the input module, and it boils down to the question: Is a name allowed to have multiple lines? If ""yes"", then the bug is in the output modules. If ""no"", then the input SDF reader should reject, or better yet, ignore multi-line names. Multi-line names are typically due to the 80-character restriction on line length in an SDF; very long names have to be broken into two lines. My suggestion is to allow them on input. On output, suppress any name that has multiple lines. You can write it in the SDF body, but not in the SDF header part. You have to drop it altogether for SMILES.

Removing the OBMol::StripSalts() method resolves the problem, as well as modifying the input file by removing either the first of second fragment (it works fine on either of these). Analysing the problems has shown that the OBMol::StripSalts() method is correctly removing the smallest fragment (the second part of the input smiles, and which contains a ring), keeping only the first part which contains no rings. However, it seems that the OBMol::GetSSSR() method, which is called on the following line, still detects the presence of rings, and this is not correct.

OBConversion conv;; conv.SetInFormat(conv.FormatFromExt(""/Users/hans/Temp/inp.smi""));; OBMol* m = new OBMol();; m->Clear();; (void) conv.ReadFile(m, ""/Users/hans/Temp/inp.smi"");; m->StripSalts();; std::vector<OpenBabel::OBRing*> r(m->GetSSSR());; int s(0);; unsigned int nrings(r.size());; for (unsigned int i = 0; i < nrings; ++i); {; if (r[i]->IsAromatic()) s += +0.2244435;; }; exit(0);. When running this program, I'm getting a segmentation fault. Removing the OBMol::StripSalts() method resolves the problem, as well as modifying the input file by removing either the first of second fragment (it works fine on either of these). Analysing the problems has shown that the OBMol::StripSalts() method is correctly removing the smallest fragment (the second part of the input smiles, and which contains a ring), keeping only the first part which contains no rings. However, it seems that the OBMol::GetSSSR() method, which is called on the following line, still detects the presence of rings, and this is not correct. As a consequence, the program crashes when calling the OBRing::IsAromatic() method, since the OBRing pointer is pointing to a ring that does not exists anymore...

I will get a Segmentation fault only when the file 'myInputFile' is of the type XXX. if I say ""CML"", then CML files will cause a segfault; and if I say ""MDL"" then molfiles will cause a segfault. However, if I say ""CML"", MDL files are read and converted just fine; and vice versa.

It adds a space in the name of the atom => shift of columns in the mol2 parsing (split on spaces). I am using openbabel 2.2.1 with Pybel. Pymol (and others progs) can't read the attached mol2 file ""aa_pybel.mol2"". If we remove the space => OK. Read mol2 file (aa.mol2) then save mol2 file (aa_pybel.mol2) => error. input file (attached; 5 H5 -5.7109 1.2001 5.9176 H 1 <1> 0.2000 ; 6 H6 -4.7607 1.2002 4.5736 H 1 <1> 0.2000 . output file; 5 H 1 -5.7109 1.2001 5.9176 H 1 ALA1 0.2000; 6 H 2 -4.7607 1.2002 4.5736 H 1 ALA1 0.2000. It's not a bog problem with 1 file but when we work with a database, it's a waste of time to check the files. TIA for your answer. Cheers. Laurent.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/893:890,Deployability,install,installed,890,"I have come across some potential issues with the way OpenBabel handles hydrogen (H2). In particular, InChI -> OBMol and OBMol -> SMILES appear to be incorrect. To reproduce the bug I present the attached Python script, which when executed results in the following output:. Source: SMILES ""[H][H]""; Formula: H2; Molecular weight: 2.01588; SMILES:; InChI: InChI=1/H2/h1H; Source: InChI ""InChI=1/H2/h1H""; Formula: H; Molecular weight: 1.00794; SMILES:; InChI: InChI=1/H2/h1H. Note that in the first case, SMILES -> OBMol -> SMILES does not match. The intermediate OBMol returns information that reflect the hydrogen molecule, as expected. Also note that in the second case, although InChI -> OBMol -> InChI appears to work, the intermediate OBMol returns information that reflect the hydrogen atom, not the hydrogen molecule. Calling AddHydrogens() has no effect. I am using OpenBabel v2.2.0 installed via the package manager in Kubuntu 9.04. Josh Allen; chemejosh -at- gmail dot com.

The behvior is the same for Open Babel 2.2.2b1 -- Jun 2 2009 -- 12:15:39 (from Avogadro package) as for Open Babel 2.2.1 -- Mar 1 2009 -- 19:20:41 (latest release package from sourceforge). The input pdb file was created from mmcif using babel. (Please note: This is important for me because I want to setup a transformation flow for my mmcif based application using some pdb based transforms and Open Babel. My application parser (Rutgers cifparse-obj-v7.025) reads complete mmcif and doesn't simply ignore those lines as e.g. pymol seems to do.) .

AttributeError: '_OBMolBondIter' object has no attribute '__bool__'; > /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/openbabel.py(3480)__init__(); 3479 self.finished = False; -> 3480 if not self.iter.__bool__():; 3481 self.finished = True. If I enter the debugger at this point, I see that self.iter is :; <openbabel._OBMolBondIter; proxy of <Swig Object of type 'OpenBabel::OBMolBondIter *' at 0x4b53b30> >. Indeed, it has no attribute __bool__() but in python 2.5 it was not expected to, as instead __nonzero__ was used. I think they changed to __bool__ in python 2.6. I've tracked down the introduction of __bool__() to ; http://github.com/rwest/openbabel/commit/e73459b6cc161fafb0542591e5ea04184816b7a3#comment_27220. I think bool(self.iter) may be better than self.iter.__bool__() in terms of compatibility with earlier python versions, but I've yet to get this all working.

I used to have it working fine with an eariler version of openbabel but upon upgrading to 2.2.3 I have rebuilt the swig bindings and rebuilt and installed the openbabel python packages etc. I seemed to have to jump through various hoops to get it to (almost) work.
