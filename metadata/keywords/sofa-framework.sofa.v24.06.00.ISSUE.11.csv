I forced the second method in a unit test by introducing a Data `useGeometricStiffnessMatrix`. It could be observed that the second method failed. It needed a fix. The product with $v_\text{in}$ was forgotten. It is now added in this pull request. ______________________________________________________.

I am not sure it is meant to be used outside of Eigen (but it's in the public API); - Manipulation of the `EigenSparseMatrix` is not consistent with the other non-linear mappings.

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/3837:863,Safety,detect,detection,863,"All non-linear mappings have a Data `d_geometricStiffness` defining how the geometric stiffness of the mappings should be computed. Depending on the mapping, it can have the following values:. - `None`; - `Exact`; - `Stabilized` (not all the mappings provide this option). By default, all mappings are set to `Stabilized`, except for `RigidMapping` which is set to `None`. I would like to set the default value to `Stabilized` also for `RigidMapping`. But I suspect that the reason it has not been done is for performances. Indeed, there are cases where there are no forces to map. In these cases, the geometric stiffness computation is superfluous (because it involves multiplication by null forces). Such cases are for example when a visual model is mapped. We can imagine detecting automatically that there are forces under a mapping or not. Depending on this detection, we can decide if the geometric stiffness should be computed or not.",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/3837

Instead, their equivalent are available as free functions. Indeed, the content did not need to be in a class and `DAGSimulation` did not override them.; - `sofa::simulation::setSimulation` is deprecated. The global variable `Simulation` is set once and for all in the initialization of the `Sofa.Simulation.Graph` module. ⚠️ If `new` is used to provide a new `Simulation`, it results in a memory leak, because `setSimulation` now does nothing. In summary, the type `Simulation` is now only useful to create `Node` instantiations. This feature can be done out of the Simulation class thanks to a refactoring of modules. It will be done later in another PR. Once it is done, the type could be deprecated. In this Pull Request, it is assumed that it is not possible to create another type of Simulation than `DAGSimulation`.

That said, I find annoying these two approaches because they are considering a a problem to have mechanicalmapping in the two list (mechanicalmapping and mapping).

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3999:327,Usability,simpl,simple,327,"The implementations of `addDForce` and `addBToMatrix` were removed in https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/commit/044f78ad4e3931b9754a90c251360f8f1e69c902. According to the commit message, an explicit formulation of the forces gives ""the best results"". This could not be tested on the example provided with SOFA as it is too simple (particles). To me, the computations seem ok, so I am in favor to keep them. However, we can discuss about activating the implicit formulation or not (through a Data?).; The implementation of `buildDampingMatrix` has been added according to #3967. ______________________________________________________.

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4010:1301,Testability,test,test,1301,"In #2777, a new API to assemble matrices was introduced. I used this new API to avoid the need to implement `addDForce` if `buildStiffnessMatrix` is already implemented. In other terms, it unifies the `addDForce` and `buildStiffnessMatrix` (previously it was `addKToMatrix`. Indeed, those two functions are very similar as they are related to the derivative of the force. This PR is a proof of concept that is not ready to be merged.

I am very new in sofa, and I am looking for a simple solution for the following :) :; I would like to simulate the cutting through of a 2-d mesh (surface) with a sharp tool.; My goal is to use this simulation to test the cutting of a soft tissue with a robot. For two reasons, I would not to use the cutting Plugin: I need it for a research project for which I do not have financial budget to buy the plugin (maybe in the future, I will). The second reason that I would like to keep the simulation very simple and operate with a low number of parameters. My question is: which examples should I take a look at?

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4180:272,Availability,error,error,272,"**[Only Windows/MSVC]**. I cannot explain at all 👺. On MSVC2022(17.7.4) and Release mode, a crash happens with `examples/Demos/fallingBeamLagrangianCollision.scn` when a collision occurs. It crashes when trying to insert values in the triplets vector (suspecting a memory error somewhere). Weirdly, it does not crash in RelWithDebug mode 🤐. ; *And* it does not crash as well on MSVC2019, as the CI (jenkins) uses it in release mode while testing the scene. At the code generation time (compiler?optimizer?) it does throw a warning like:; `1>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.37.32822\include\vector(398): warning C4789: buffer 'triplets' of size 16 bytes will be overrun; 8 bytes will be written starting at offset 16`; only in Release mode. --. Two fixes possible (found by trial-and-error 🤡); - using std::vector instead of sofa::type::vector; - using a struct instead of the tuple; ; I used the std::vector one as it was the simplest. I suspect there is a bug(???)/issue with the optimizer/vectorizer of MSVC , or the allocator but i cannot prove anything 🙊. ______________________________________________________.

Also there are header files missing which are relevant for using the provided libQGLViewer in external projects/plugins. This is caused by the now modified ```Sofa/GUI/Qt/libQGLViewer/QGLViewer/CMakeLists.txt```:; - The last argument for the ```sofa_create_package_with_targets``` macro adds too many ```/${PROJECT_NAME}``` causing the long install path (line 118); - For some reason the ```sofa_create_package_with_targets``` macro does not copy the ```MOC_HEADER_FILES``` (line 21 ff.). ## Solution:; This PR shortens the output path and copies the contents of ```MOC_HEADER_FILES``` to the ""normal"" ```HEADER_FILES``` which causes them to be copied to the install/include directory. This does not affect the build but ensures that all headers are copied. This was tested on Windows and two different Linux installations.
