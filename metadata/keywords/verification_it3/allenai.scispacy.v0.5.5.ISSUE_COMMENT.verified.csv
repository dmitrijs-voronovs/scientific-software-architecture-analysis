Overall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented). However I definitely see your point that we should try to make this a bit nicer. In another project I used to work on, we had the concept of using a decorator to register this type of info with the base class, so it can construct itself. That might be a bit of overkill here, but maybe we could provide a function which does this global mutation for you and throws intelligent errors if you e.g try to overwrite something in there? . I think you're right that we need to fix this if we want people to frequently be able to create their own very specific/custom linkers though so thanks for raising it!",error,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237#issuecomment-651504169:1695,errors,1695,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237#issuecomment-651504169,1,['error'],['errors'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA = LinkerPaths(; ann_index=""path/to/nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectorizer=""path/to//nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectors=""path/to/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib"",; concept_aliases_list=""path/to/concept_aliases.json"",; ); class UMLS2020KnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):; def __init__(; self,; file_path: str = ""path/to/2020AA.json"",; ):; super().__init__(file_path). # Admittedly this is a bit of a hack, because we are mutating a global object.; # However, it's just a kind of registry, so maybe it's ok.; DEFAULT_PATHS[""umls2020""] = CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA; DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES[""umls2020""] = UMLS2020KnowledgeBase. linker = CandidateGenerator(name=""umls2020""). ```. Overall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented). However I definitely see your point that we should try to make this a bit nicer. In another project I used to work on, we had the concept of using a decorator to register this type of info with the base class, so it can construct itself. That might be a bit of overkill here, but maybe we could provide a function which does this global mutation for you and throws intelligent errors if you e.g try to overwrite something in there? . I think you're right that we need to fix this if we want people to frequently be able to create their own very specific/custom linkers though so thanks for raising it!

Availability,"Hi @DeNeutoy, thanks for the information! I'm happy to share that I managed to create my custom Entity Linker based on the 2020AA release. It took a bit longer (~8 hours) to build the ANN index, but this could very well be because of the size of my UMLS subset (all level 0 sources + SNOMED). . Overall, it was not tóó difficult to do, but I think some small changes in the code would make it even easier. I don't have an answer to this question myself yet -- if I have time and I do think of a good solution, I will try to see if I can help out by creating a PR.

Availability,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

Deployability,"Hi @JohnGiorgi ,. This is caused by a couple of things:. 1. In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package. The entity linker uses nmslib, an approximate nearest neighbour library to do sparse nearest neighbour search over tf-idf vectors for entities. I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has. If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:. `Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`. When I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2. 2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4. The Candidate Generator which the entity linker uses has a parameter which controls the speed/precision trade off for the approximate nearest neighbours search (the numbers here are measuring ANN queries per second). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16001974/97484674-4acf3300-1916-11eb-924e-12941df0fd6e.png). By default, we set this parameter to `200`. You can change this value to speed up the search substantially, for a small ish cost in recall:. https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L204.

If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:. `Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`. When I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2. 2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4. The Candidate Generator which the entity linker uses has a parameter which controls the speed/precision trade off for the approximate nearest neighbours search (the numbers here are measuring ANN queries per second). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16001974/97484674-4acf3300-1916-11eb-924e-12941df0fd6e.png). By default, we set this parameter to `200`. You can change this value to speed up the search substantially, for a small ish cost in recall:. https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L204. Let me know if that's helpful!

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Yeah, this is a limitation of the abbreviation algorithm, sorry about that. I suspect there is not a simple fix for this. Depending on your use case and tradeoffs, you could try to patch this yourself by looking one word back from the abbreviation returned and seeing if it starts with the first letter of the short form, or something like that.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Integrability,"wing:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker. It seems like some useful evaluations would be the following:. - P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset with gold mentions; - mention detection P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset.

Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content:  these will first have to be loaded using `load_approximate_nearest_neighbours_index`, and this one only accepts a `LinkerPaths` object. So I ended up writing something like the following (based on how it's done for the pre-trained `umls` and `mesh` linkers in `candidate_generation.py`):. ```; import json; import joblib. from scispacy.linking_utils import UmlsKnowledgeBase; from scispacy.candidate_generation import (; CandidateGenerator,; LinkerPaths,; load_approximate_nearest_neighbours_index,; ).

Performance,"Hi @ChantalvanSon ,. Great that you got it working, sorry it was a bit tricky. You raise some good points - there is one way that you can not require your function which loads all the pieces which is this:. ```python; from scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES; from scispacy.candidate_generation import (; CandidateGenerator,; LinkerPaths; ).

Overall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented). However I definitely see your point that we should try to make this a bit nicer. In another project I used to work on, we had the concept of using a decorator to register this type of info with the base class, so it can construct itself. That might be a bit of overkill here, but maybe we could provide a function which does this global mutation for you and throws intelligent errors if you e.g try to overwrite something in there? . I think you're right that we need to fix this if we want people to frequently be able to create their own very specific/custom linkers though so thanks for raising it!",load,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237#issuecomment-651504169:170,loads,170,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237#issuecomment-651504169,1,['load'],['loads'],"The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively.

CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA = LinkerPaths(; ann_index=""path/to/nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectorizer=""path/to//nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectors=""path/to/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib"",; concept_aliases_list=""path/to/concept_aliases.json"",; ); class UMLS2020KnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):; def __init__(; self,; file_path: str = ""path/to/2020AA.json"",; ):; super().__init__(file_path). # Admittedly this is a bit of a hack, because we are mutating a global object.; # However, it's just a kind of registry, so maybe it's ok.; DEFAULT_PATHS[""umls2020""] = CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA; DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES[""umls2020""] = UMLS2020KnowledgeBase. linker = CandidateGenerator(name=""umls2020""). ```. Overall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented). However I definitely see your point that we should try to make this a bit nicer. In another project I used to work on, we had the concept of using a decorator to register this type of info with the base class, so it can construct itself. That might be a bit of overkill here, but maybe we could provide a function which does this global mutation for you and throws intelligent errors if you e.g try to overwrite something in there? . I think you're right that we need to fix this if we want people to frequently be able to create their own very specific/custom linkers though so thanks for raising it!

Performance,"Hi @DeNeutoy, thanks for the information! I'm happy to share that I managed to create my custom Entity Linker based on the 2020AA release. It took a bit longer (~8 hours) to build the ANN index, but this could very well be because of the size of my UMLS subset (all level 0 sources + SNOMED). . Overall, it was not tóó difficult to do, but I think some small changes in the code would make it even easier. I don't have an answer to this question myself yet -- if I have time and I do think of a good solution, I will try to see if I can help out by creating a PR. But I think it comes down to the following:. `CandidateGenerator()` currently accepts a pre-trained linker (`umls` or `mesh`), for which the default `LinkerPaths` have been defined globally in the `candidate_generation.py`. While it is possible to provide your own `ann_index`, `tfidf_vectorizer`, `ann_concept_aliases_list` and `kb`, these will first have to be loaded using `load_approximate_nearest_neighbours_index`, and this one only accepts a `LinkerPaths` object.

Performance,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. . I am currently working on some integration stuff with `allennlp` (see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3040) to make it easier to hook in more complicated models, and I also want to try the entity linker from spacy too. I've just re-read the medmentions paper and it seems like they added much more detail about the st21pv subset - previously when I'd read it I thought it was much more specific to IR. I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker.

Safety,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

Safety,"wing:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. . I am currently working on some integration stuff with `allennlp` (see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3040) to make it easier to hook in more complicated models, and I also want to try the entity linker from spacy too. I've just re-read the medmentions paper and it seems like they added much more detail about the st21pv subset - previously when I'd read it I thought it was much more specific to IR. I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker. It seems like some useful evaluations would be the following:. - P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset with gold mentions; - mention detection P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset.

I also successfully installed scispacy from pip which is great! I included the install log for scispacy below the log for nmslib.

Content: Hi Daniel,. I tried to install nmslib again in a new py 3.9 environment and it looks like it actually did install but there were issues. The entire log from the install is below. I also successfully installed scispacy from pip which is great! I included the install log for scispacy below the log for nmslib. Maybe I did something wrong before when I created the env for scispacy?. I will be testing it soon and will let you know if anything else comes up. Thank you for following up with me on this.

Testability,"Hi @JohnGiorgi ,. This is caused by a couple of things:. 1. In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package. The entity linker uses nmslib, an approximate nearest neighbour library to do sparse nearest neighbour search over tf-idf vectors for entities. I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has. If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:. `Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`. When I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2. 2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4. The Candidate Generator which the entity linker uses has a parameter which controls the speed/precision trade off for the approximate nearest neighbours search (the numbers here are measuring ANN queries per second). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16001974/97484674-4acf3300-1916-11eb-924e-12941df0fd6e.png).

Usability,"1) The version on the demo is probably not the latest release version. I should check and update that.; 2/3/4) First, this is a model, so inconsistent and surprising output is likely, and some memorization is likely (@DeNeutoy looks like data augmentation could help a lot here). Second, the BC5CDR corpus was annotated with specific guidelines (https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/media/store/files/2015/bc5_CDR_data_guidelines.pdf) which you may want to read and see if they align with your expectations of what would be annotated as a chemical. Here is some output of a mix of real and made up chemical names. I don't really conclude anything from this, other than that the model is definitely using some combination of the form of the name itself and the context; ```; In [29]: for drug_name in [""mesna"", ""remdesivir"", ""mebane"", ""relidate"", ""novila"", ""aspirin"", ""coloxal"", ""inovivir"", ""scopolamine"", ""entamine"", ""valimine"", ""henirin"", ""noonirin"", ""halirin""]:; ...: text = f""The drug {drug_name} is used to treat the virus""; ...: doc = nlp(text); ...: print(doc.ents); ...: ; (mesna,); (); (mebane,); (); (); (aspirin,); (); (); (scopolamine,); (entamine,); (valimine,); (henirin,); (); (); ```. Looks like it is also sensitive to capitalization; ```; In [56]: doc = nlp(""Remdesivir is a chemical""); In [57]: doc.ents; Out[57]: (Remdesivir,). In [58]: doc = nlp(""remdesivir is a chemical""). In [59]: doc.ents; Out[59]: (); ```. I don't have much else to add at the moment. We were thinking about running some data augmentation experiments to try to improve the NER, but haven't done it yet (I'd be thrilled to have a contribution along those lines).; 5) Definitely the model takes into account the context that the word occurs in, so it is not wholly surprising to me that the same word could be classified differently in different contexts.",guid,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/336#issuecomment-800691659:334,guidelines,334,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/336#issuecomment-800691659,1,['guid'],['guidelines'],"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

I should check and update that.; 2/3/4) First, this is a model, so inconsistent and surprising output is likely, and some memorization is likely (@DeNeutoy looks like data augmentation could help a lot here). Second, the BC5CDR corpus was annotated with specific guidelines (https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/media/store/files/2015/bc5_CDR_data_guidelines.pdf) which you may want to read and see if they align with your expectations of what would be annotated as a chemical. Here is some output of a mix of real and made up chemical names. I don't really conclude anything from this, other than that the model is definitely using some combination of the form of the name itself and the context; ```; In [29]: for drug_name in [""mesna"", ""remdesivir"", ""mebane"", ""relidate"", ""novila"", ""aspirin"", ""coloxal"", ""inovivir"", ""scopolamine"", ""entamine"", ""valimine"", ""henirin"", ""noonirin"", ""halirin""]:; ...: text = f""The drug {drug_name} is used to treat the virus""; ...: doc = nlp(text); ...: print(doc.ents); ...: ; (mesna,); (); (mebane,); (); (); (aspirin,); (); (); (scopolamine,); (entamine,); (valimine,); (henirin,); (); (); ```. Looks like it is also sensitive to capitalization; ```; In [56]: doc = nlp(""Remdesivir is a chemical""); In [57]: doc.ents; Out[57]: (Remdesivir,). In [58]: doc = nlp(""remdesivir is a chemical""). In [59]: doc.ents; Out[59]: (); ```. I don't have much else to add at the moment. We were thinking about running some data augmentation experiments to try to improve the NER, but haven't done it yet (I'd be thrilled to have a contribution along those lines).; 5) Definitely the model takes into account the context that the word occurs in, so it is not wholly surprising to me that the same word could be classified differently in different contexts.

Usability,"Hi @JohnGiorgi ,. This is caused by a couple of things:. 1. In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package. The entity linker uses nmslib, an approximate nearest neighbour library to do sparse nearest neighbour search over tf-idf vectors for entities. I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has. If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:. `Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`. When I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2. 2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4.

BTW, In trying sbd with `en_core_sci_md`, scispacy performs well.; However, there's some minor tokenization problem and if custom rules are added, it can be prevented.; https://gist.github.com/izuna385/512a9c62868c751a8290a9676f994d16; (Maybe this isn't scispacy's problem.). > also please let us know any feedback you have when using the models, or additional features you'd love. Of course I will. (Whether by e−mail or issue depends on the situation.)

Usability,"Makes sense. So it seems to pretty much be working with a bit of a workaround. The files are initially cached to `/root/.scispacy/datasets/`.

To update the environment variable, as described:. ```python; import os; os.environ['SCISPACY_CACHE'] = '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/'; ```. However, this alone does not find the cached files. It will re-download the files again. In order to see the new environment variable, it's necessary to restart the runtime: `Runtime->Restart runtime`. Now when running the entity linker, it will see the _permanently_ cached files. So is an enhancement necessary? It'd definitely be easier and more foolproof to simply add a parameter such as `cache_folder` to the `nlp.add_pipe()` method.

Usability,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. . I am currently working on some integration stuff with `allennlp` (see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3040) to make it easier to hook in more complicated models, and I also want to try the entity linker from spacy too.

I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker.

Usability,"Thanks for the suggestion @chrishmorris! While your idea is reasonable, incorporating that human intuition into the dependency parsing model is quite difficult. See https://spacy.io/api/dependencyparser for more details on the dependency parsing model.

Content: Thanks for the suggestion @chrishmorris! While your idea is reasonable, incorporating that human intuition into the dependency parsing model is quite difficult. See https://spacy.io/api/dependencyparser for more details on the dependency parsing model.

Quality Attribute: Usability

Content: for scispacy `pipeline` gives . ```; [('attribute_ruler',; <spacy.pipeline.attributeruler.AttributeRuler at 0x7f1a5969e3c0>),; ('sentencizer', <spacy.pipeline.sentencizer.Sentencizer at 0x7f1a59754640>)]; ```. Where as regular spacy gives. ```; [('sentencizer', <spacy.pipeline.pipes.Sentencizer at 0x7f821ef95e50>)]; ```. So it looks like scispacy adds a custom attribute_ruler, but both scispacy and spacy use the same sentencizer? Does that sound right?. scispacy gives much better results than spacy for abstracts.

Content: nues to increase, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools that help users to search, discover and understand the scientific literature have become critical.; In recent years, substantial improvements in NLP tools have been brought about by pretrained neural language models (LMs) (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019).; While such models are widely used for representing individual words ∗ Equal contribution 1 https://github.com/allenai/specter or sentences, extensions to whole-document embeddings are relatively underexplored.; Likewise, methods that do use inter-document signals to produce whole-document embeddings (Tu et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019) have yet to incorporate stateof-the-art pretrained LMs.; Here, we study how to leverage the power of pretrained language models to learn embeddings for scientific documents.; A paper’s title and abstract provide rich semantic content about the paper, but, as we show in this work, simply passing these textual fields to an “off-the-shelf” pretrained language model—even a state-of-the-art model tailored to scientific text like the recent SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019)—does not result in accurate paper representations.; The language modeling objectives used to pretrain the model do not lead it to output representations that are helpful for document-level tasks such as topic classification or recommendation.; In this paper, we introduce a new method for learning general-purpose vector representations of scientific documents.; Our system, SPECTER, 2 incorporates inter-document context into the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) language models (e.g., SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019)) to learn document representations that are effective across a wide-variety of downstream tasks, without the need for any task-specific fine-tuning of the pretrained language model.; We specifically use citations as a naturally occurring, inter-document incidental supervision signal indicating which documents are most related
