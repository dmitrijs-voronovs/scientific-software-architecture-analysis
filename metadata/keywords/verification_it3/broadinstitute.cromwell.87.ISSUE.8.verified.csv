Thus the `StandardSyncExecutionActor` (SSEA) could be refactored also, and even merging the SSEA and the SAEA into a single actor/fsm. Also, when considering rewrites, it was also noted that the term ""sync/async"" in the SSEA/SAEA names were confusing. Possible alternatives were StandardFutureExecutionActor / StandardMessagingExecutionActor. Again this may be moot if the actors are merged into a single actor.

But environment variables are a bit trickier. There doesn't currently seem to be a nice way in WDL of composing a string like`-e key1=value1 -e key2=value2`. I've started working up a proposal over [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/pull/84) for one way WDL might support this; feel free to chime in there! 😄

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Output your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""
}
",True,"The provided content relates to enhancing configuration manageability through environment variables, rather than modifying the system's core features or adapting to different environments, which aligns with the description of the Modifiability quality attribute."

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: NOTE: I haven't 100% confirmed that the application.conf isn't auto-included, but since we now have separated cromwell into artifacts, based on the HOCON docs it does not appear that we're using an ""application.conf"" as intended: https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#conventional-configuration-files-for-jvm-apps. If someone needs to specify a backend via a new application.conf, they shouldn't need to do one of the two current workarounds:. 1) Know to include the _original_ application.conf.; 2) Copy/paste all of the previous application.conf, including things like akka dispatcher executors. The fix is to rename the core/src/main/resources/{application.conf => reference.conf}. When one then adjusts settings while running the fat-jar, one definitely doesn't need to re-include a reference.conf. The ticket says ""most of?"" because there may be some elements of the current core/.../application.conf that would be more appropriate for a fat-jar _only_, such as having the main.hsqldb and an included Local backend.

The way it happens is based on the presumption that almost all the information that we needed was present in the `StateName` and `StateData` of our FSMs. Unfortunately, with Akka's `SubscribeTransitionalCallback` we can only monitor the FSM states, and not the data. So I've created a trait (which the Engine's FSMs can extend from) which provide the semantics of wrapping up the state and data of the FSM in a message, and publish it into Akka's event stream. The ProfilerActor is the listener of these events and handles them appropriately. With this, I was able to make the FSMs unaware of the MetadataServices, and simply publish it's state and data in the event stream while performing any transitions.~~. ~~Let me know if you guys have any (other?) ideas / suggestions.~~.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: Per #4826, when Cromwell is configured with `workflow-log-temporary: false` and workflow does not specify `final_workflow_log_dir`, Cromwell server does not close the log file resulting in a file handle leak. The lack of a file close also prevents certain FUSE drivers from flushing any file contents to remote storage, making it impossible for clients to actually read the logs until the server is terminated (which may be never). . Looking at the code, there is no call to `workflowLogger.close()` or `workflowLogger.close(andDelete = false)` unless the file is being copied. This line in WorkflowActor.scala:; `case None if WorkflowLogger.isTemporary => workflowLogger.close(andDelete = true)`; should change to:; `case None => workflowLogger.close(andDelete = WorkflowLogger.isTemporary)`. At this point in the code, the log contents have been fully written and the log should be closed, regardless of whether the logs are temporary or not. . I've tested that this fix resolves the issue according to repro instructions in #4826.

Modifiability,"Per standup this morning we've decided to close this. The requested functionality is problematic on a few levels:.

Currently Cromwell's backend assignments happen at initialization time, but in the future Cromwell's backend dispatch is likely to become more sophisticated and dynamic. It therefore wouldn't be possible to say at workflow initialization time the backend to which a call was fated, which would mean the default runtime attribute handling would need to happen in the various `FooRuntimeAttributes` classes as it does now. The refactor proposed here would actually remove the default runtime attribute handling at call execution time and therefore make dynamic dispatch more difficult to add in the future.

Modifiability,"Re this PR, I'm re-working it to pass all of the task call-specific monitoring info (workflow name/id, task call name/index/attempt, `inputs`, `disks`, and the opaque image-specific `monitoringConfig` string) through a JSON config file on GCS (thanks @kshakir for the idea!). This way, we no longer have to use environmental variables, and can pass much more data than can be held in a variable (looking at you, `inputs`!). That still has a potential problem of running against the API quota for GCS, but since we already access multiple files from that execution bucket inside the task, the assumption is that accessing one extra file won't hurt. However, I'm unsure if we should just get rid of all of the environmental variables in favor of one that points to the GCS URL of the JSON config, or should we keep them (and thus duplicate information) for backwards compatibility. AFAIK, hardly anyone used this feature yet, especially given that the current ""official"" `monitoring_image` has been essentially broken, because Google decided to start failing Stackdriver Monitoring requests if they are submitted more than 1/minute, for a given time series. We should fix the `monitoring_image` separately (or replace it with the BigQuery version), but the question remains whether we still want to keep those env vars around for that previous use case (for anyone who might've been using a custom `monitoring_image` already).

Content: Re:. > The capoeira tests complete successfully but get unexpected cache hits. Caching is also tweaked in CI configs. For example:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/279909b1f35c8305dcfc23ac8534dcb00ce09771/src/ci/resources/local_provider_config.inc.conf#L6. Have you already tried the tests locally with the CI configs? For unicromtal, one can run the existing CI scripts with a bit of bootstrap:; - Setup vault; - Setup mysql locally (I'm using `brew install mysql`); - [Initialize a `travis` mysql user with granted permissions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/adding-users.html); - [Using the `travis` user create a `cromwell_test` schema](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/279909b1f35c8305dcfc23ac8534dcb00ce09771/core/src/test/resources/application.conf#L24). From the cromwell source directory, with all of the above setup, one can try to run `src/ci/resources/testCentaurLocal.sh` and it will render the configs with vault and run the tests, including the restart tests that bring down/up cromwell. Also, if one just wants to ever use the CI configs with cromwell in IntelliJ, `sbt renderCiResources` will render configs into the folder `target/ci/resources`.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: So I moved the http{} stanza to the correct place in the cromwell_cori.conf file (it was there but in the wrong place). And I changed Local to Mylocal in lines 22 & 26 in the config file. I used this command ; ```; export _JAVA_OPTIONS=""--add-opens=java.base/sun.security.util=ALL-UNNAMED"". java -Dconfig.file=cromwell_docker.conf; -Dbackend.providers.MyLocal.config.dockerRoot=$(pwd)/cromwell-executions; -Dbackend.providers.MyLocal.config.root=$(pwd)/cromwell-executions; -jar ~/cromwell/cromwell-84.jar run fq_count.wdl -i fq_count.json; ```; (Note the change from Local to Mylocal in the command). This command should fail with the ""Could not build the path"" error. Would you please try again with this new cromwell_docker.conf file and new command?.

Modifiability,"So I think I'm now clear regarding the options on this thread. One option, and the original one discussed, is a container entrypoint (""Orchestrator"" as @danbills put it). Another option, which is what I originally thought was being discussed, is an always-running sidecar. That entrypoint container would then launch our target container, similar to something like https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/ or https://github.com/delagoya/batch-task-runner. IMHO, the entrypoint/Orchestrator introduces some unnecessary complexity. It works for a simple case, but leaves a lot of configuration as TBD. To implement this properly we'd need to implement a standard task definition for the entrypoint (or Orchestrator) container (simple), but also pass to that container all the necessary docker parameters necessary for implementing the target container (much more difficult). There is also the question of supervision for the target container as the entrypoint/Orchestrator is hiding from batch and Cromwell the actual task's status. Also, the permissions issues I brought up in my comment above apply. I also have some concerns about the implementation of this approach within Cromwell, as I believe (but I'm not certain), this scheme would require some non-trivial changes to the StandardAsyncExecutionActor class as well as the AwsBatchAsyncExecutionActor logic (likely moreso on the later). I haven't investigated, but I also have some concerns over whether this mechanism would require significant rework of the process input/output and return code. It looks like @delagoya may have considered this in the batch-task-runner repo, but I'm not clear on this after the limited time I've had reviewing the repo.

Modifiability,"Thanks for pointing out the Cromwell/PAPI v2 beta support for docker image caches, I wasn't aware of this feature. . After reading the documentation at https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/backends/Google/#docker-image-cache-support, I have a few additional questions about how this could help with the problem described in this issue. . It looks like docker image caching needs to be configured at the Cromwell server level with a manifest file indicating the location of images. Are the images listed in the manifest truly global (as indicated in their paths, ie `projects/broad-dsde-cromwell-dev/global/images/..`), so they won't incur egress to use them to create VMs in different regions? Can they be made public for use by users in other projects?. For an external user already running their own cromwell instance in a different region who wants to run our pipeline, we'd need to publish an image caching configuration stanza and manifest file along with our workflow, and the administrator of the cromwell server would need to modify their server configuration to point to our manifest file and restart the server -- is that correct?

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: Thanks for pointing out the Cromwell/PAPI v2 beta support for docker image caches, I wasn't aware of this feature. . After reading the documentation at https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/backends/Google/#docker-image-cache-support, I have a few additional questions about how this could help with the problem described in this issue. . It looks like docker image caching needs to be configured at the Cromwell server level with a manifest file indicating the location of images. Are the images listed in the manifest truly global (as indicated in their paths, ie `projects/broad-dsde-cromwell-dev/global/images/..`), so they won't incur egress to use them to create VMs in different regions? Can they be made public for use by users in other projects?. For an external user already running their own cromwell instance in a different region who wants to run our pipeline, we'd need to publish an image caching configuration stanza and manifest file along with our workflow, and the administrator of the cromwell server would need to modify their server configuration to point to our manifest file and restart the server -- is that correct? If their cromwell server was already configured with a different image cache manifest, is there a way to add a second manifest, or would they have to edit their own cache manifest to include the entries in ours?. If I'm right in my understanding (please correct me if I'm not) it seems like this solution could help, but is quite cumbersome and requires very savvy external users who are willing to take extra steps to help prevent saddling us with egress charges. It would be great if a cache manifest could be configured at the workflow level -- perhaps in the wdl or the workflow options.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: The code used for localizing and executing the Cromwell exec script is embedded within tar.gz file in the cromwell code base. Today, each user of cromwell must locate the worker.tar.gz from cromwell's source code repository and provide a location of the file as a runtime attribute. If the path provided in the runtime attributes is a local path then cromwell streams the bytes to the OSS `Command.packagePath`. Instead of requiring the user to access cromwell's source code cromwell should move the file into an embedded resource under the directory `src/main/resources/`. The likely package location based on the other classes is `supportedBackends/bcs/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/impl/bcs/`.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: The mint team ran a group of ~200 10x workflows where 18 failed due to PAPI error code 10.14. Many of the tasks were stuck waiting for quota. For example, the following non-preemptible task ran for 3h 51m before failing with this error:. `CellRanger.cellranger_count:NA:1 failed. The job was stopped before the command finished. PAPI error code 10. 14: VM ggp-16203705785274897556 stopped unexpectedly.` . It would be useful if the `max_retries` runtime parameter included retrying tasks that fail with the above error, so that the workflow does not need to be manually re-run after failing. **Configuration info**:; Cromwell version: Cromwell-as-a-Service (caas-prod) version `35-5f86a05-SNAP`; Backend: PAPI v1

Currently the only hook we have for custom container engines is the `submit-docker` field, which is a script that runs when a task is run that specifies a docker image.

Modifiability,"This issue was prompted by the following thread on the forum: https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/wdl/discussion/10347/localization-via-hard-link-has-failed. By default, cromwell does not specify a user when running docker, which leads to two issues:. Firstly, it will run each tasks as whatever user the docker image specifies, typically 'root' as this is the default. This means that depending on how the docker image was build, a completely random user is suddenly the owner of your output files. For example, if the user inside the docker container has UID 1042, this could map to a completely unrelated user on the host system, who is suddenly the owner of your output files. Related to this issue is the fact that all output files have to be world-readable by default, or else the cromwell process will not have read access to the files it has just created (which are now owned by UID 1042). This is not desireable when cromwell is run on a system with many users, some of which should not have read access to eachothers data (for example when working with patient data). As a solution, I propose to change the default docker invocation to run the analysis as $EUID by default. This works even when the EUID is not mapped to a valid user within the docker image, and ensures that the cromwell user is the owner of all the files generated by docker. From man bash: ""EUID Expands to the effective user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup. This variable is readonly."" , so it should be available on every system.

Docker runtime attributes with docker hashes do not need any additional processing. All logic in this ticket applies to docker runtime attributes with a ""floating"" tag, which will be referred as ""tag"" in this issue. In all cases, if Cromwell fails to retrieve the docker hash for a task, for any reason, the corresponding call(s) will NOT be eligible for call caching, neither read nor write, regardless of the call caching configuration in effect. **When to get the hashes and what to do with them:**. 1. Cromwell will lookup the hashes corresponding to docker tags, for all docker attributes in all tasks in a workflow and its subworkflows, at Materialization time.; If the runtime attribute value can't be determined, the task in question will be ineligible for call caching. The only case when that should be true is if the attribute is an expression with variables depending on previous tasks being run. 2. If the hash lookup succeed, Cromwell will use that hash to perform any call cache read / write according to the call caching configuration in effect. It will also provide that hash, along with the original floating tag, to the backend when the job gets dispatched. 3. Backends will choose wether to use the hash or the floating tag. They will report to the engine which one they used, so that the engine can send this information to the metadata. **How to get the hash:**. 1. How to get the hash depends on the backend. Which means, at this time, that only workflows for which the backend is known statically at workflow submission time will be supported. 2. If the task is expected to run on the **Local Backend**, Cromwell will attempt to find the hash corresponding to the tag on the machine where it's being run.

In all cases, if Cromwell fails to retrieve the docker hash for a task, for any reason, the corresponding call(s) will NOT be eligible for call caching, neither read nor write, regardless of the call caching configuration in effect. **When to get the hashes and what to do with them:**. 1. Cromwell will lookup the hashes corresponding to docker tags, for all docker attributes in all tasks in a workflow and its subworkflows, at Materialization time.; If the runtime attribute value can't be determined, the task in question will be ineligible for call caching. The only case when that should be true is if the attribute is an expression with variables depending on previous tasks being run. 2. If the hash lookup succeed, Cromwell will use that hash to perform any call cache read / write according to the call caching configuration in effect. It will also provide that hash, along with the original floating tag, to the backend when the job gets dispatched. 3. Backends will choose wether to use the hash or the floating tag. They will report to the engine which one they used, so that the engine can send this information to the metadata. **How to get the hash:**. 1. How to get the hash depends on the backend. Which means, at this time, that only workflows for which the backend is known statically at workflow submission time will be supported. 2. If the task is expected to run on the **Local Backend**, Cromwell will attempt to find the hash corresponding to the tag on the machine where it's being run. This first attempt must be done without executing a `pull` to avoid overriding the current local image, if it exits, with the remote rep

Modifiability,"This sets up a mechanism to:; 1) Collect information about ""load"" from various part of the system; 2) Summarize this information and calculate a global load; 3) Notify parts of the system of changes in the global load. Current implementation is simple:; Only 2 load levels: `NormalLoad` and `HighLoad`; Actors reporting their load are:; - WriteMetadataActor; - JobStoreReadActor; - JobStoreWriteActor; - CallCacheWriteActor; - CallCacheReadActor; - KeyValueReadActor; - KeyValueWriteActor; - IoActor; - JesAPIQueryManagerActor. Additionally free memory is also being monitored and will go to `HighLoad` if going below a certain threshold. Global load == max(all load levels). So if one actor or more say their load is high, the global load will be high, otherwise normal.; The only actor listening to changes on the global load is the job token dispenser. It will stop dispensing tokens when load is high and start again when load is back to normal. At the exception of the IoActor, all the above mentioned actors have a queue in which they store work to be done. Their load is determined by comparing the size of this queue to a threshold.; The IoActor's queue is not easily accessible because hidden in the stream implementation and its size cannot easily be known. However we know when its full because we can't add to it anymore (this is when backpressure messages are sent). When that happens the IO actor reports its load to be `High`.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: This sets up a mechanism to:; 1) Collect information about ""load"" from various part of the system; 2) Summarize this information and calculate a global load; 3) Notify parts of the system of changes in the global load. Current implementation is simple:; Only 2 load levels: `NormalLoad` and `HighLoad`; Actors reporting their load are:; - WriteMetadataActor; - JobStoreReadActor; - JobStoreWriteActor; - CallCacheWriteActor; - CallCacheReadActor; - KeyValueReadActor; - KeyValueWriteActor; - IoActor; - JesAPIQueryManagerActor. Additionally free memory is also being monitored and will go to `HighLoad` if going below a certain threshold. Global load == max(all load levels). So if one actor or more say their load is high, the global load will be high, otherwise normal.; The only actor listening to changes on the global load is the job token dispenser. It will stop dispensing tokens when load is high and start again when load is back to normal. At the exception of the IoActor, all the above mentioned actors have a queue in which they store work to be done. Their load is determined by comparing the size of this queue to a threshold.; The IoActor's queue is not easily accessible because hidden in the stream implementation and its size cannot easily be known. However we know when its full because we can't add to it anymore (this is when backpressure messages are sent). When that happens the IO actor reports its load to be `High`. When it hasn't had to backpressure for 10 seconds, the load returns to normal. There are many ways this could be made smarter but it already yields improvements in terms of stability and robustness. TODO: . - [x] Add Changelog; - [x] Configuration ? Lots of thresholds and values in this PR that could be configurable, how much and how do we want to configure ?

Modifiability,"This was deliberately ""not allowed"", to try to force people to pass through the inputs and outputs to their workflows (ie so that the interface to a workflow was stable even if extra tasks were added or removed from its internal workings). In other words to encourage:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow Test2 {; input {; String? passthrough_text; }. call Echo {; input: text = passthrough_text; }. output {; }; }; ```. This would allow you to swap out the internal call to `Echo` for something else, or rename the call, or add another call after it, or replace the entire workflow itself with a single task, etc, etc... and nobody who's calling `Test2` needs to worry about your internal refactorings. They just `call Test2` and supply the input and are done. Now having said that, I've pretty much changed my mind about this being something to enforce rather than just something to encourage, and would ideally like to go down the route of saying ""best practices are to pass through inputs and outputs but it's not enforced because quite often it's super-annoying""",refactor,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4079#issuecomment-420048870:685,refactorings,685,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4079#issuecomment-420048870,1,['refactor'],['refactorings'],"The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments.

Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: This was deliberately ""not allowed"", to try to force people to pass through the inputs and outputs to their workflows (ie so that the interface to a workflow was stable even if extra tasks were added or removed from its internal workings). In other words to encourage:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow Test2 {; input {; String? passthrough_text; }. call Echo {; input: text = passthrough_text; }. output {; }; }; ```. This would allow you to swap out the internal call to `Echo` for something else, or rename the call, or add another call after it, or replace the entire workflow itself with a single task, etc, etc... and nobody who's calling `Test2` needs to worry about your internal refactorings. They just `call Test2` and supply the input and are done. Now having said that, I've pretty much changed my mind about this being something to enforce rather than just something to encourage, and would ideally like to go down the route of saying ""best practices are to pass through inputs and outputs but it's not enforced because quite often it's super-annoying""

Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: Updated Language Spec: https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/blob/spec/SPEC.md#workflow-description-language. What you'll find in here:; - Updates to the parser for the various syntax changes we decided on. Tests have also been updated and all WDL files I could find have been updated for the new syntax.; - `EngineFunctions` -> `WdlStandardLibraryFunctions` with stubs for everything that's in the specification.; - Implemented the following on `LocalEngineFunctions`: `write_map()`, `read_map()`, `write_lines()`. Tests also added for these; - Refactoring of parts of the backend to be able to accommodate the implementation of the functions described above.; - Syntax Highlighter updated for new syntax; - Map literals now allowed in WDL source. Tests included.; - Slightly better coercion semantics: Added an identity coercion ; - Remove / refactor a lot of tech debt.; - Removed the `Command` class, now consumed into `Task` class. Since the spec change, Commands needed to know more about stuff defined at the task level (specifically, Declarations).; - Exposure of workflow outputs section in the `Workflow` class, they are not honored further than that though.
