The groupings shown above are; not unique and are certainly not rigorously defined. We regard the groupings; used in Psi4 as a “chemist’s grouping” as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms; (i.e. , , etc.) in; the exchange component. A final note is that both Disp22(T); and Est.Disp22(T) results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The Disp22(T); result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis;; Est.Disp22(T) is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space and is our best estimate. The Est.Disp22(T); value is used in the SAPT energy and dispersion component (see [Hohenstein:2010:104107]; for details). Finally, this part of the output file contains sSAPT0, a special scaling; scheme of the SAPT0 energy that can yield improved results and was described in more details; above.

Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies. Publications resulting; from the use of the higher-order SAPT code should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code in Psi; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)'). The corrections can also be computed automatically; by appending dmp2 to the name of the method, with or without CCD dispersion; energy('sapt2+dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)dmp2').

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; Psi4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Caution; In early versions (notably Psi4 alpha circa 2011; and before), frozen core was implemented incompletely and for; only selected terms. Comparisons with papers published using early; Psi4 SAPT code may show discrepancies of 0.01-0.10 kcal/mol in; individual terms, particularly and . Caution; January 28th 2016, the default for all NAT_ORBS options; was changed to true. Hence the code now by default uses natural; orbital truncation to speed up the evaluation of energy terms; wherever possible, according to literature recommendations.; In early July 2016, some total sapt energy psivars were renamed. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, .

This is the preferred method of; running the SAPT module. SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; Psi4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Caution; In early versions (notably Psi4 alpha circa 2011; and before), frozen core was implemented incompletely and for; only selected terms. Comparisons with papers published using early; Psi4 SAPT code may show discrepancies of 0.01-0.10 kcal/mol in; individual terms, particularly and . Caution; January 28th 2016, the default for all NAT_ORBS options; was changed to true. Hence the code now by default uses natural; orbital truncation to speed up the evaluation of energy terms; wherever possible, according to literature recommendations.; In early July 2016, some total sapt energy psivars were renamed. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, .

The; individual terms are grouped according to the component of the interaction; to which they contribute. The total component energies (i.e.,; electrostatics, exchange, induction, and dispersion) represent what we; regard as the best estimate available at a given level of SAPT computed; from a subset of the terms of that grouping. The groupings shown above are; not unique and are certainly not rigorously defined. We regard the groupings; used in Psi4 as a “chemist’s grouping” as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms; (i.e. , , etc.) in; the exchange component. A final note is that both Disp22(T); and Est.Disp22(T) results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The Disp22(T); result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis;; Est.Disp22(T) is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space and is our best estimate. The Est.Disp22(T); value is used in the SAPT energy and dispersion component (see [Hohenstein:2010:104107]; for details).

The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies.

Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code in Psi; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)'). The corrections can also be computed automatically; by appending dmp2 to the name of the method, with or without CCD dispersion; energy('sapt2+dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)dmp2'). A brief note on memory usage: the higher-order SAPT code assumes that; certain quantities can be held in core. This code requires sufficient; memory to hold arrays in core.

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies. Publications resulting; from the use of the higher-order SAPT code should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code in Psi; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)'). The corrections can also be computed automatically; by appending dmp2 to the name of the method, with or without CCD dispersion; energy('sapt2+dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)dmp2').

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; Psi4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Caution; In early versions (notably Psi4 alpha circa 2011; and before), frozen core was implemented incompletely and for; only selected terms. Comparisons with papers published using early; Psi4 SAPT code may show discrepancies of 0.01-0.10 kcal/mol in; individual terms, particularly and . Caution; January 28th 2016, the default for all NAT_ORBS options; was changed to true. Hence the code now by default uses natural; orbital truncation to speed up the evaluation of energy terms; wherever possible, according to literature recommendations.; In early July 2016, some total sapt energy psivars were renamed. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction.

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; Psi4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Caution; In early versions (notably Psi4 alpha circa 2011; and before), frozen core was implemented incompletely and for; only selected terms. Comparisons with papers published using early; Psi4 SAPT code may show discrepancies of 0.01-0.10 kcal/mol in; individual terms, particularly and . Caution; January 28th 2016, the default for all NAT_ORBS options; was changed to true. Hence the code now by default uses natural; orbital truncation to speed up the evaluation of energy terms; wherever possible, according to literature recommendations.; In early July 2016, some total sapt energy psivars were renamed. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, .

The; individual terms are grouped according to the component of the interaction; to which they contribute. The total component energies (i.e.,; electrostatics, exchange, induction, and dispersion) represent what we; regard as the best estimate available at a given level of SAPT computed; from a subset of the terms of that grouping. The groupings shown above are; not unique and are certainly not rigorously defined. We regard the groupings; used in Psi4 as a “chemist’s grouping” as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms; (i.e. , , etc.) in; the exchange component. A final note is that both Disp22(T); and Est.Disp22(T) results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The Disp22(T); result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis;; Est.Disp22(T) is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space and is our best estimate. The Est.Disp22(T); value is used in the SAPT energy and dispersion component (see [Hohenstein:2010:104107]; for details). Finally, this part of the output file contains sSAPT0, a special scaling; scheme of the SAPT0 energy that can yield improved results and was described in more details; above.

Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the ; approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate these deviations, Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommend to scale all approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. where the recommended exponent is .

The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from an one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy.

Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters.

For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build (). The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SOSCF step.; SOSCF requires that all elements of the gradient to be less than one before the; method is valid. To this end, pre-SOSCF SCF iterations use normal; gradient-based extrapolation procedures (e.g., DIIS) until the gradient; conditions are met.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In Psi4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In Psi4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL.

For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxilia",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf-1.html

Within the DF portion; of the computation, the zeroth-iteration uses a non-idempotent density matrix; obtained from the SAD guess, so the energy is unphysically low. However, the; first true iteration is quite close to the final DF energy, highlighting the; efficiency of the SAD guess. Pulay’s DIIS procedure is then used to accelerate; SCF convergence, with the DF phase reaching convergence in eight true; iterations. When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems. Additional convergence; techniques are available for more difficult cases, and are detailed below. At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess.

The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In Psi4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix.

For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; Psi4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree-Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In Psi4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In Psi4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf-1.html

The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. For some of these algorithms, Schwarz and/or density sieving can be used to; identify negligible integral contributions in extended systems. To activate; sieving, set the INTS_TOLERANCE keyword to your desired cutoff; (1.0E-12 is recommended for most applications).; Recently, we have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE; DIRECT. At the moment, the code defaults to cc-pVDZ-JKFIT as the; auxiliary basis, unless the user specifies DF_BASIS_SCF manually. For; some atoms, cc-pVDZ-JKFIT is not defined, so this procedure will fail. In these; cases, you will see an error message of the form:; RuntimeError: sanity check failed! Gaussian94BasisSetParser::parser:; Unable to find the basis set for HE. This failure can be fixed by either setting DF_BASIS_SCF to an auxiliary; basis set defined for all atoms in the system, or by setting DF_SCF_GUESS; to false, which disables this acceleration entirely. Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build ().

In case the minimization does not succeed; or ends up on the same unstable solution, you can tune the scale factor for the orbital; rotation through the keyword FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE:; set follow_step_scale 0.5. The rotation angle is (FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE). The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS:; set max_attempts 1. the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS.; The main algorithm available in Psi4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm. It can only; work with SCF_TYPE PK, and it explicitly builds the full electronic Hessian; matrix before explicitly inverting it. As such, this algorithm is very slow and it should; be avoided whenever possible. Direct Inversion is automatically invoked if the newer algorithm; is not available.; The Davidson algorithm for stability analysis was implemented recently.; Only the lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian are computed, and Hessian-vector; products are computed instead of the full Hessian. This algorithm is thus; much more efficient than the Direct Inversion, but is at present only available for UHF->UHF stability; analysis. The capabilities of both algorithms are summarized below:.

Default within this context: 3; SOLVER_MIN_SUBSPACE: Minimum size of the subspace when collapsing.; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE: Maximum size of the subspace. Default within this context: 12. In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure,; it is recommended to first increase SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE, especially if you solve; for a large number of roots.

However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER.

READ becomes the default for the second and later iterations; of geometry optimizations.; SAD; Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems.; GWH; Generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, a simple Huckel-Theory-like method based on; the overlap and core Hamiltonian matrices. May be useful in open-shell systems.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a checkpoint file, casting from one basis to; another if needed. Useful for starting anion computations from neutral; orbitals, or after small geometry changes. At present, casting from a; different molecular point group is not supported. This becomes the; default for the second and later iterations of geometry optimizations. These are all set by the GUESS keyword.

Note that while the total number of macroiterations will be; less for SOSCF than gradient-based convergence acceleration the cost of solving; the microiterations typically results in the overall cost being greater for; SOSCF than for gradient-based methods. Therefore, SOSCF should only be used if; it is difficult to locate a stable minimum.; SOSCF is only available for RHF, ROHF, and UHF reference. To turn on simply set; the option SOSCF to true. Additional options to modify the number of; microiterations taken are as follows:. SOSCF_R_START: when to start SOSCF based on the current density RMS; SOSCF_MAX_ITER: the maximum number of SOSCF microiterations per macroiteration; SOSCF_CONV: the relative convergence tolerance of the SOSCF microiterations; SOSCF_PRINT: option to print the microiterations or not. Stability Analysis¶; SCF algorithms attempt to minimize the gradient of the energy with respect; to orbital variation parameters. At convergence, the gradient should be approximately zero; given a convergence criterion. Although this is enough to make sure the SCF converged to a; stationary point, this is not a sufficient condition for a minimal SCF solution. It may be; a sadle point or a maximum.; To ensure that a minimum has been found, the electronic Hessian, i.e. the matrix of second; derivatives of the energy with respect to orbital variation parameters, must be computed.; If one or more eigenvalu",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf-1.html

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is already quite flexible and powerful, with new features being; added weekly. We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your primary basis/atom type. Then use; DIRECT.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

The first set of iterations are from the DF portion of the computation, the; second set uses the exact (but much slower) Direct algorithm.

Broken Symmetry¶; For certain problems, such diradicals, allowing the spin-up and spin-down; orbitals to differ in closed-shell computations can be advantageous;; this is known as symmetry breaking.

Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs).

This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence.

ERI Algorithms¶; The key difficulty in the SCF procedure is treatment of the four-index ERI; contributions to the Fock Matrix. A number of algorithms are available in; Psi4 for these terms. The algorithm is selected by the SCF_TYPE; keyword, which may be one of the following. PK [Default]; An out-of-core, presorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Quite fast for a; zero-error algorithm if enough memory is available. Integrals are; generated only once, and symmetry is utilized to reduce number of; integrals.; OUT_OF_CORE; An out-of-core, unsorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Overcomes the; memory bottleneck of the current PK algorithm. Integrals are generated; only once, and symmetry is utilized to reduce number of integrals.; DIRECT; A threaded, sieved, integral-direct algorithm, with full permutational; symmetry.

This algorithm is highly optimized, and is threaded; with a mixture of parallel BLAS and OpenMP. Note that this algorithm; should use the -JKFIT series of auxiliary bases, not the -RI or; -MP2FIT bases. The default guess for auxiliary basis set should work; for all Dunning bases, otherwise the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword can; be used to manually specify the auxiliary basis. This algorithm is; preferred unless either absolute accuracy is required; [CCSD(T)] or a -JKFIT auxiliary basis is unavailable; for the primary basis/atoms involved.; CD; A threaded algorithm using approximate ERI’s obtained by Cholesky; decomposition of the ERI tensor.

For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your primary basis/atom type. Then use; DIRECT.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is already quite flexible and powerful, with new features being; added weekly. We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In Psi4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In Psi4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In Psi4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html

Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available.

In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from an one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy.

ERI Algorithms¶; The key difficulty in the SCF procedure is treatment of the four-index ERI; contributions to the Fock Matrix. A number of algorithms are available in; Psi4 for these terms.

This algorithm is highly optimized, and is threaded; with a mixture of parallel BLAS and OpenMP. Note that this algorithm; should use the -JKFIT series of auxiliary bases, not the -RI or; -MP2FIT bases.

If one or more constraints have to be relaxed to reach; a lower-energy solution, there is an external instability. In Psi4, the only external instability; that can be checked at present is the RHF->UHF one.; Currently, two algorithms exist in Psi4 for stability analysis: the original; Direct Inversion and the newly implemented Davidson algorithms. We will first describe; options common to both algorithms. To request a stability analysis at the end of the SCF,; set the keyword STABILITY_ANALYSIS:; set stability_analysis check. to only compute the electronic Hessian eigenvalue and check if an actual SCF minimum; has been found, or:; set stability_analysis follow. to rotate the converged orbitals along the lowest eigenvector, then invoke the SCF; procedure again to lower the energy. In case the minimization does not succeed; or ends up on the same unstable solution, you can tune the scale factor for the orbital; rotation through the keyword FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE:; set follow_step_scale 0.5. The rotation angle is (FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE). The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS:; set max_attempts 1. the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS.; The main algorithm available in Psi4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm. It can only; work with SCF_TYPE PK, and it explicitly builds the full electronic Hessian; matrix before explicitly inverting it. As such, this algorithm is very slow and it should; be avoided whenever possible. Direct Inversion is automatically invoked if the newer algorithm; is not available.; The Davidson",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html

In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure,; it is recommended to first increase SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE, especially if you solve; for a large number of roots. This will result in a higher computational cost of each iteration, but should; make the solver better behaved. However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER. External potentials and QM/MM¶; In addition to the implementation of EFP for accurate QM/MM; computations, Psi4 can perform more rudimentary QM/MM procedures via the; EXTERN keyword. The following snippet, extracted from the; extern1 test case, demonstrates its use for a TIP3P external potential:; Chrgfield = QMMM(); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge(-0.834, 1.649232019048, 0.0, -2.356023604706); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -3.799961446760); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -0.912085762652); psi4.set_global_option_python('EXTERN',Chrgfield.extern).

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is already quite flexible and powerful, with new features being; added weekly. We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs).

For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; Psi4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree-Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2). Abelian spatial symmetry is fully supported in Psi4, and can be used to; obtain physical interpretation of the molecular orbitals, to assist in difficult; convergence cases, and, in some methods, ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In Psi4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In Psi4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html

The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. For some of these algorithms, Schwarz and/or density sieving can be used to; identify negligible integral contributions in extended systems. To activate; sieving, set the INTS_TOLERANCE keyword to your desired cutoff; (1.0E-12 is recommended for most applications).; Recently, we have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE; DIRECT. At the moment, the code defaults to cc-pVDZ-JKFIT as the; auxiliary basis, unless the user specifies DF_BASIS_SCF manually. For; some atoms, cc-pVDZ-JKFIT is not defined, so this procedure will fail. In these; cases, you will see an error message of the form:; RuntimeError: sanity check failed! Gaussian94BasisSetParser::parser:; Unable to find the basis set for HE. This failure can be fixed by either setting DF_BASIS_SCF to an auxiliary; basis set defined for all atoms in the system, or by setting DF_SCF_GUESS; to false, which disables this acceleration entirely. Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build ().

In case the minimization does not succeed; or ends up on the same unstable solution, you can tune the scale factor for the orbital; rotation through the keyword FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE:; set follow_step_scale 0.5. The rotation angle is (FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE). The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS:; set max_attempts 1. the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS.; The main algorithm available in Psi4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm. It can only; work with SCF_TYPE PK, and it explicitly builds the full electronic Hessian; matrix before explicitly inverting it. As such, this algorithm is very slow and it should; be avoided whenever possible. Direct Inversion is automatically invoked if the newer algorithm; is not available.; The Davidson algorithm for stability analysis was implemented recently.; Only the lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian are computed, and Hessian-vector; products are computed instead of the full Hessian. This algorithm is thus; much more efficient than the Direct Inversion, but is at present only available for UHF->UHF stability; analysis. The capabilities of both algorithms are summarized below:.

SOLVER_MAXITER: maximum number of iterations; SOLVER_CONVERGENCE: eigenvector convergence threshold; SOLVER_N_ROOT: Solve for N eigenvectors in each irreducible representation; SOLVER_N_GUESS: Use N guess vectors, this needs to be larger than the number of roots so that the lowest ones can be captured reliably. Default within this context: 3; SOLVER_MIN_SUBSPACE: Minimum size of the subspace when collapsing.; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE: Maximum size of the subspace. Default within this context: 12. In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure,; it is recommended to first increase SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE, especially if you solve; for a large number of roots. This will result in a higher computational cost of each iteration, but should; make the solver better behaved. However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER.

First a QMMM object is created, then three separate particles are added to this; object before the SCF code is told about its existence on the last line. The; calls to addCharge take the atomic charge, x coordinate, y coordinate, and; z coordinate in that order. The atomic charge is specified in atomic units,; and the coordinates always use the same units as the geometry specification in; the regular QM region.

Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option.

The matrix contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree-Fock.

This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. CORE [Default]; Diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems. READ becomes the default for the second and later iterations; of geometry optimizations.; SAD; Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems.; GWH; Generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, a simple Huckel-Theory-like method based on; the overlap and core Hamiltonian matrices. May be useful in open-shell systems.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a checkpoint file, casting from one basis to; another if needed. Useful for starting anion computations from neutral; orbitals, or after small geometry changes. At present, casting from a; different molecular point group is not supported. This becomes the; default for the second and later iterations of geometry optimizations. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; BASIS_GUESS = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness. An example of performing an RHF solution of water by SAD guessing; in a 3-21G basis and then casting up to cc-pVTZ is shown below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/scf.html

The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SOSCF step.; SOSCF requires that all elements of the gradient to be less than one before the; method is valid. To this end, pre-SOSCF SCF iterations use normal; gradient-based extrapolation procedures (e.g., DIIS) until the gradient; conditions are met. Note that while the total number of macroiterations will be; less for SOSCF than gradient-based convergence acceleration the cost of solving; the microiterations typically results in the overall cost being greater for; SOSCF than for gradient-based methods. Therefore, SOSCF should only be used if; it is difficult to locate a stable minimum.; SOSCF is only available for RHF, ROHF, and UHF reference. To turn on simply set; the option SOSCF to true. Additional options to modify the number of; microiterations taken are as follows:.

Stability Analysis¶; SCF algorithms attempt to minimize the gradient of the energy with respect; to orbital variation parameters. At convergence, the gradient should be approximately zero; given a convergence criterion. Although this is enough to make sure the SCF converged to a; stationary point, this is not a sufficient condition for a minimal SCF solution.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0.00077279 0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial-1.html

However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. memory 250 mb. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common Psi4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10].

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in Psi4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals.

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers. Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy with Psithon¶; Finally, let’s consider an example that shows how the Python driver; in Psi4 simplifies some routine tasks. Psi4 can interpret; valid Python code in addition to the computational chemistry directives; we’ve seen in the previous examples; we call this mixture Psithon.; The Python computer language is very easy to pick up, and even users; previously unfamiliar with Python can use it to simplify tasks by; modifying some of the example input files supplied with Psi4; in the psi4/samples directory.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, Psi4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables ( and ), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; Psi4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (subtracting any ”.in” or ”.dat” suffix),; plus a ”.out” suffix. Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory. Running a Basic Hartree–Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree–Fock SCF computation; for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. We will specify the; geometry of our water molecule using a standard Z-matrix.; # Any line starting with the # character is a comment line; #!

Any user options need to; be set before the procedure they are meant to affect. For your convenience, the above example can be found in; tu1-h2o-energy.; You can run it if you wish.; Once Psi4 is in your path (see the; User Configuration; section of the installation instructions), you can run this computation by typing; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about , so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, Psi4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix.

If it works, it should print; the final energy as; @UHF Final Energy: -38.92533462456894. Notice we added a new keyword, set reference uhf, to the input. For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient.

The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common Psi4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10].

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in Psi4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0]. set basis aug-cc-pVDZ; set freeze_core True. # Initialize a blank dictionary of counterpoise corrected energies; # (Need this for the syntax below to work); ecp = {}. for R in Rvals:; dimer.R = R; ecp[R] = energy('ccsd(t)', bsse_type = 'cp'). psi4.print_out(""\n""); psi4.print_out(""CP-corrected CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energies\n\n""); psi4.print_out("" R [Ang] E_int [kcal/mol] \n""); psi4.print_out(""-----------------------------------------------------\n""); for R in Rvals:; e = ecp[R] * psi_hartree2kcalmol; psi4.print_out("" %3.1f %10.6f\n"" % (R, e)). First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = energy('ccsd(t)', bsse_type='cp'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function _nbody_gufunc() does it all for us, automatically.; Near the very end of the output file, the counterpoise correction Python; function will print a nice summary of the results of the counterpoise; computation (the energies of the dimer, of monomer 1 with the ghost functions; of monomer 2, of monomer 2 with the ghost functions of monomer 1, and the; overall counterpoise-corrected interaction energy):; //>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>//; // CP Computation: Results. //; //<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<//. ============= Hartree =============; System: Energy (full):; Complex -257.4186740329; Monomer 1 -128.7093",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]. So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].

For now, we’ll note that most of; the SAPT energy components are negative; this means those are attractive; contributions (the zero of energy in a SAPT computation is defined as; non-interacting monomers). The exchange contributions are positive; (repulsive). In this example, the most attractive contribution between; ethylene and acetylene is an electrostatic term of -2.12 kcal mol-1; (Elst10,r where the 1 indicates the first-order; perturbation theory result with respect to the intermolecular interaction,; and the 0 indicates zeroth-order with respect to intramolecular electron; ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in Psi4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. memory 250 mb. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm-1; may exist):; Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6480; A1 4113.3794; B2 4212.1826; -----------------------------------------------. Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1775.65; Force c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/tutorial.html

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }. Here’s the second half of the input, where we specify the computation; options:; set {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0'). Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common Psi4 options can be; set in a globals section like this.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; Psi4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (subtracting any ”.in” or ”.dat” suffix),; plus a ”.out” suffix. Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory. Running a Basic Hartree–Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree–Fock SCF computation; for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. We will specify the; geometry of our water molecule using a standard Z-matrix.; # Any line starting with the # character is a comment line; #!

Any user options need to; be set before the procedure they are meant to affect. For your convenience, the above example can be found in; tu1-h2o-energy.; You can run it if you wish.; Once Psi4 is in your path (see the; User Configuration; section of the installation instructions), you can run this computation by typing; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about , so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, Psi4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix.

If it works, it should print; the final energy as; @UHF Final Energy: -38.92533462456894. Notice we added a new keyword, set reference uhf, to the input. For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient.

ADC: Ab Initio Polarization Propagator¶; Code author: Masaaki Saitow; Section author: Masaaki Saitow; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, ADC; The ADC code seeks the pole structure of the polarization; propagator, which is equivalent to the correlated excitation energy,; in terms of the second order algebraic-diagrammatic construction; (ADC(2)) scheme. Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D\(_n\)) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as \({\cal O}(N^5)\). In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; The ADC code makes use of the libtrans library for efficient and flexible; integral-transformation and also the libdpd library to; utilize molecular symmetry in the t",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/adc-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/adc-1.html

Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D\(_n\)) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as \({\cal O}(N^5)\).

In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as \({\cal O}(N^5)\). In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; The ADC code makes use of the libtrans library for efficient and flexible; integral-transformation and also the libdpd library to; utilize molecular symmetry in the tensorial manipulations in framework; of the direct-product decomposition algorithm. By this feature, the Ritz; space and intermediate tensors are blocked according to the irreducible; representations of the point group, and the excited states that belong; to different symmetry are sought separately.; In the output of ADC, the ADC(2) results may look as follows:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13-> 1 B1 state : 0.2565095 (a.u.), 6.9799824 (eV); Non-iterative: 0.2565636 (a.u.), 6.9814532 (eV); Occ Vir Coefficient; ---------------------------------------------; 3 0 -0.9017047264; 3 2 0.3038332241; 3 1 0.2907567119; 3 5 -0.0790167706; 3 4 -0.0425829926.

CFOUR_ESTATE_PROP (CFOUR); CFOUR — This keyword applies only to EOM-CC calculations and specifies whether any excited or ionized state one-electron properties are to be calculated. Proper use of this keyword requires a relatively advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry and the available options are discussed here. The options are: OFF (=0) [no properties or transition moments are calculated]; EXPECTATION (=1) [transition moments and dipole strengths are calculated along with selected one-electron properties which are evaluated as expectation values]; UNRELAXED (=2) [selected one-electron properties are calculated in an approximation that neglects relaxation of molecular orbitals]; RESPONSE (=3) [selected one-electron properties are calculated as analytic first derivatives of the energy].

What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in CFOUR_OCCUPATION. For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the %excite* input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros. Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ESTATE_TRANS (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether just the excitation energies (OFF, =0) or in addition transition moments (EXPECTATION, =1) are calculated.

For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0.

The code seems to work in most cases, but has currently been implemented for point groups with E type representation and not for those with triply-, quadruply- or pentuply-degenerate representations. Extending the code to those cases is probably straightforward, and the reader is encouraged to do so if (s)he is so inclined. SYM_CHECK=0 “forces” the high-symmetry solution. SYM_CHECK=OVERRIDE (=1) doesn’t. The latter is the default. Type: boolean; Default: true. CFOUR_SYMMETRY (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies what subgroup of the full point group is to be used in the energy and/or gradient calculation (the computational point group).

If the default NO (=0) is specified then no frequencies are calculated. For ANALYTIC, vibrational frequencies are determined from analytically computed second derivatives, and for FINDIF (=2) vibrational frequencies are calculated from a force field obtained by numerical differentiation of analytically evaluated gradients (or even single-point energies) using symmetry-adapted mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates. If vibrational frequencies are calculated, a normal mode analysis using the computed force-constant matrix is performed, rotationally projected frequencies are computed, infrared intensities are determined, and zero-point energies (ZPE) are evaluated. Type: string; Possible Values: NO, ANALYTIC, FINDIF; Default: NO. CFOUR_VTRAN (CFOUR); CFOUR — This keyword defines what type of integral transformation is to be performed in the program xvtran. FULL/PARTIAL (=0) allows the transformation program to choose the appropriate type of transformation, while FULL (=1) requires a full integral transformation and PARTIAL (=2) means a MBPT(2)-specific transformation where the \((ab \vert cd)\) integrals are not formed.

A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations.

In order to this option to be valid one should use “TPDM_ABCD_TYPE = COMPUTE” option. Type: boolean; Default: false. CEPA_LEVEL (FNOCC); FNOCC (Expert) — Which coupled-pair method is called? This parameter is used internally by the python driver. Changing its value won’t have any effect on the procedure. Type: string; Default: CEPA(0). CEPA_NO_SINGLES (FNOCC); FNOCC — Flag to exclude singly excited configurations from a coupled-pair computation. Type: boolean; Default: false. CEPA_OS_SCALE (OCC); OCC — CEPA opposite-spin scaling value from SCS-CCSD. Type: double; Default: 1.27. CEPA_SOS_SCALE (OCC); OCC — CEPA Spin-opposite scaling (SOS) value. Type: double; Default: 1.3. CEPA_SS_SCALE (OCC); OCC — CEPA same-spin scaling value from SCS-CCSD. Type: double; Default: 1.13. CEPA_TYPE (OCC); OCC — CEPA type such as CEPA0, CEPA1 etc. currently we have only CEPA0. Type: string; Possible Values: CEPA0; Default: CEPA0. CFOUR_ABCDTYPE (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the way the \(\langle ab||cd \rangle\) molecular orbital integrals are handled in post-MP2 calculations. STANDARD (= 0) uses directly the corresponding MO integrals and thus results in an algorithm which in particular for large-scale calculations results in excessive use of disk space (storage of all \(\langle ab||cd\rangle\) integrals. AOBASIS (=2) uses an AO-based algorithm to evaluate all terms involving the \(\langle ab",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/autodoc_glossary_options_c-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/autodoc_glossary_options_c-1.html

The maximum number of records which can be held is 100. Type: integer; Default: 10. CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL (CFOUR); CFOUR — Defines the level of calculation to be performed. Psi4 Interface: Keyword set from argument of computation command: CCSD if energy('c4-ccsd'), etc. See Energy (CFOUR) and Gradient (CFOUR). for all available. Type: string; Possible Values: SCF, HF, MBPT(2), MP2, MBPT(3), MP3, SDQ-MBPT(4), SDQ-MP4, MBPT(4), MP4, CCD, CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT-1, CCSDT-1b, CCSDT-2, CCSDT-3, CCSDT-4, CCSDT, CC2, CC3, QCISD, QCISD(T), CID, CISD, UCC(4), B-CCD; Default: SCF. CFOUR_CC_CONV (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the convergence criterion for the CC amplitude equations. The amplitudes are considered to be converged when the maximum of all (absolute) changes in the amplitudes is less than \(10^N\), where \(N\) is the value associated with the keyword. Type: integer; Default: 7. CFOUR_CC_EXPORDER (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the maximum number of expansion vectors used in the iterative subspace to enhance convergence in the solution of the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 5. CFOUR_CC_EXTRAPOLATION (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the type of convergence acceleration used to solve the CC equations. RLE (=0) uses the RLE methods of Purvis and Bartlett, DIIS (=1) uses the DIIS approach by Pulay, NOJACOBI (=2) uses RLE with continuous extrapolation, OFF (=3) uses no convergence acceleration. In general, DIIS provides the best results and is recommended, while OFF often results in poor convergence and thus cannot be recommended. Type: string; Possible Values: RLE, DIIS, NOJACOBI, OFF; Default: DIIS. CFOUR_CC_MAXCYC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the maximum number of iterations in solving the CC amplitude equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. CFOUR_CC_PROGRAM (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies which CC program is used. The available options are VCC (=0), ECC (=1), MRCC (=2), and EXTERNAL (=3). The default for all calculations is currently VCC which requests usage ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/autodoc_glossary_options_c-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/autodoc_glossary_options_c-1.html
