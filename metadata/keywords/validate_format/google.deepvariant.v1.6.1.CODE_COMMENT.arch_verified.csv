1. Whether it should be eliminated (true/false)
2. The reason for elimination (if applicable)

Evaluation criteria:
- Eliminate text that consists primarily of:
  * Code snippets or samples (marked by syntax, keywords like ""if/else"", brackets, etc.)
  * Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
  * API documentation or specifications (parameter lists, return types)
  * Configuration files or build system output
  * Version control metadata or comments
  * Compiler/interpreter output or warnings
- Keep text that contains:
  * Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
  * Explanatory or descriptive content
  * Human-written prose discussing concepts or ideas

Content: """"""Gets the diploid genotype for candidate_variant from matched truth_variant. This method figures out the genotype for candidate_variant by matching alleles; in candidate_variant with those used by the genotype assigned to; truth_variant. For example, if candidate is A/C and truth is A/C with a 0/1; genotype, then this function would return (0, 1) indicating that there's one; copy of the A allele and one of C in truth. If the true genotype is 1/1, then; this routine would return (1, 1). The routine allows candidate_variant and truth_variant to differ in both; the number of alternate alleles, and even in the representation of the same; alleles due to those differences. For example, candidate could be:. AGT/A/AGTGT => 2 bp deletion and 2 bp insertion. and truth could have:. A/AGT => just the simplified 2 bp insertion. And this routine will correctly equate the AGT/AGTGT allele in candidate; with the A/AGT in truth and use the number of copies of AGT in truth to; compute the number of copies of AGTGT when determining the returned genotype. Args:; candidate_variant: Our candidate third_party.nucleus.protos.Variant variant.; truth_variant: Our third_party.nucleus.protos.Variant truth variant; containing true alleles and genotypes.

This is intentional, to make this class; easy to use for testing where you often want to use less-than-perfectly formed; inputs. In order to fully meet the contract of a standard VcfReader, variants; should be sorted by their contig ordering and then by their start and finally; by their ends. Implementation note:; The current implementation will be very slow for query() if the provided; cache of variants is large, as we do a O(n) search to collect all of the; overlapping variants for each query. There are several straightforward; optimizations to do if we need/want to scale this up. (a) sort the variants; and use a binary search to find overlapping variants (b) partition the; variants by contig, so we have dict[contig] => [variants on contig], which; allows us to completely avoid considering any variants on any other contigs.; Neither of these optimizations are worth it if len(variants) is small, but; it may be worth considering if we want to use this functionality with a; large number of variants.; """"""
