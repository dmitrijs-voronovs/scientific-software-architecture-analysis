Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: // TEMP(version4): In version 4 checksum is embedded in the on disk representation,; // so we need to strip that as well from the byte count.; // Support for version 4 will be dropped before the class moves out of experimental.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
