Apoptosis has been shown to be induced by serum deprivation or copper treatment. To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon. These results indicated that nonylphenol diethoxylate has capability to affect cell differentiation and development and has potentially harmful effect on organisms because of its unexpected impact on apoptosis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",recover,MatchSource.DOCS,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/tree/v0.5.5/tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt:5631,recovered,5631,tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/tree/v0.5.5/tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt,1,['recover'],['recovered'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

Deployability,"; ### Creating a release. Scispacy has two components:. - The scispacy pip package; - The scispacy models. The scispacy pip package is published automatically using the `.github/actions/publish.yml` github action. It happens whenever a release is published (with an associated tag) in the github releases UI. In order to create a new release, the following should happen:. #### Updating `scispacy/version.py`; Update the version in version.py. #### Training new models. The entire pipeline can be run using `spacy project run all`. This will train and package all the models. The packages should then be uploaded to the `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/{VERSION}` S3 bucket, and references to previous models (e.g in the readme and in the docs) should be updated. You can find all these places using `git grep <previous version>`. The scripts `install_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, `print_out_metrics.py`, `smoke_test.py`, and `uninstall_local_packages.py` are useful for testing at each step of the process. Before uploading, `install_local_packages.py` and `smoke_test.py` can be used to make sure the packages are installable and do a quick check of output. `print_out_metrics.py` can then be used to easily get the metrics that need to be updated in the README. Once the packages have been uploaded, `uninstall_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, and `smoke_test.py` can be used to ensure everything was uploaded correctly. #### Merge a PR with the above changes; Merge a PR with the above changes, and publish a release with a tag corresponding to the commit from the merged PR.

Content: ><img width=""50%"" src=""docs/scispacy-logo.png"" /></p>. This repository contains custom pipes and models related to using spaCy for scientific documents. In particular, there is a custom tokenizer that adds tokenization rules on top of spaCy's; rule-based tokenizer, a POS tagger and syntactic parser trained on biomedical data and; an entity span detection model. Separately, there are also NER models for more specific tasks. **Just looking to test out the models on your data? Check out our [demo](https://scispacy.apps.allenai.org)** (Note: this demo is running an older version of scispaCy and may produce different results than the latest version). ## Installation; Installing scispacy requires two steps: installing the library and intalling the models. To install the library, run:; ```bash; pip install scispacy; ```. to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:. ```bash; pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.4/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.4.tar.gz; ```.

",False,"The content provided discusses ScispaCy, which is a biomedical natural language processing library. Deployability refers to how well software can be deployed in an operational environment. While the content talks about deployment of models and libraries, specifically for biomedical text processing, it's not clear if this relates directly to deploying software applications or systems into production environments. The key aspects mentioned (automation, speed, granularity) are more about model deployment rather than application deployment. Therefore, the content does not accurately reflect Deployability as per its definition. Hence, it is a false positive."

You can access the list of abbreviations via the `doc._.abbreviations` attribute and for a given abbreviation,; you can access it's long form (which is a `spacy.tokens.Span`) using `span._.long_form`, which will point to; another span in the document. #### Example Usage; ```python; import spacy. from scispacy.abbreviation import AbbreviationDetector. nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""). # Add the abbreviation pipe to the spacy pipeline.; nlp.add_pipe(""abbreviation_detector""). doc = nlp(""Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \; inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \; of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \; SBMA can be caused by this easily.""). print(""Abbreviation"", ""\t"", ""Definition""); for abrv in doc._.abbreviations:; 	print(f""{abrv} \t ({abrv.start}, {abrv.end}) {abrv._.long_form}""). >>> Abbreviation	 Span	 Definition; >>> SBMA 		 (33, 34) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> SBMA 	 	 (6, 7) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> AR 		 (29, 30) androgen receptor; ```. > **Note**; > If you want to be able to [serialize your `doc` objects](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading), load the abbreviation detector with `make_serializable=True`, e.g. `nlp.add_pipe(""abbreviation_detector"", config={""make_serializable"": True})`. ### EntityLinker.

By using exome sequencing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06). Our observations reinforce that DCTN4 missense variants, especially p.Tyr263Cys, may be involved in the pathogenesis of CPA in male CF.; 25763772	0	5	DCTN4	T103	UMLS:C4308010; 25763772	23	63	chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection	T038	UMLS:C0854135; 25763772	67	82	cystic fibrosis	T038	UMLS:C0010674; 2

Energy Efficiency,"psulation. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm.

",True,"The provided code snippet from the Hearst Patterns component in SpaCy discusses the implementation of a hyponym detection system. Hyponyms relate to the hierarchy and relationships between different concepts, such as specific types of entities (e.g., 'bulbo-spinal atrophy' being a specific form of spinal muscular atrophy). The mention of 'CUIs' (Concept Unique Identifiers) and their corresponding TUIs (Thesaurus Unique Identifiers) suggests the system is handling classification and integration of various biological concepts. This aligns with integrability as it involves combining systems or components, in this case, integrating different medical entities through their unique identifiers. The code's purpose is to facilitate such integrations by detecting hierarchical relationships among these entities, thereby supporting the ease of combining systems in a more structured and compatible manner."

Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm.

Apoptosis has been shown to be induced by serum deprivation or copper treatment. To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon.

If you already have a Python; environment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section. 1. [Follow the installation instructions for Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). 2. Create a Conda environment called ""scispacy"" with Python 3.9 (any version >= 3.6 should work):. ```bash; mamba create -n scispacy python=3.10; ```. 3. Activate the Mamba environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy. ```bash; mamba activate scispacy; ```. Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above. Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:; ```python; import spacy; nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""); doc = nlp(""Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.""); ```. #### Note on upgrading; If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have. ## Available Models. To install a model, click on the link below to download the model, and then run . ```python; pip install </path/to/download>; ```.

Content: ) can be used set up a virtual environment with the; version of Python required for scispaCy. If you already have a Python; environment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section. 1. [Follow the installation instructions for Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). 2. Create a Conda environment called ""scispacy"" with Python 3.9 (any version >= 3.6 should work):. ```bash; mamba create -n scispacy python=3.10; ```. 3. Activate the Mamba environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy. ```bash; mamba activate scispacy; ```. Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above. Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:; ```python; import spacy; nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""); doc = nlp(""Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.""); ```. #### Note on upgrading; If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have. ## Available Models. To install a model, click on the link below to download the model, and then run . ```python; pip install </path/to/download>; ```. Alternatively, you can install directly from the URL by right-clicking on the link, selecting ""Copy Link Address"" and running ; ```python; pip install CMD-V(to paste the copied URL); ```. | Model | Description | Install URL; |:---------------|:------------------|:----------|; | en_core_sci_sm | A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~100k vocabulary. |[Download](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.4/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.4.tar.gz)|; | en_core_

While entity recognition contributes indirectly to safety by ensuring accurate data representation, it may not fully align with the primary focus on detecting and mitigating harmful states. Therefore, it is considered a true positive as there's a clear relation to the quality attribute through entity detection contributing to overall system accuracy and indirectly to safety."

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: ary and intalling the models. To install the library, run:; ```bash; pip install scispacy; ```. to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:. ```bash; pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.4/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.4.tar.gz; ```. Note: We strongly recommend that you use an isolated Python environment (such as virtualenv or conda) to install scispacy.; Take a look below in the ""Setting up a virtual environment"" section if you need some help with this.; Additionally, scispacy uses modern features of Python and as such is only available for **Python 3.6 or greater**. ### Installation note: nmslib; Over the years, installing nmslib has becomes quite difficult.
