Evaluate whether the content accurately aligns with its associated quality attribute, given the context provided. Your goal is to determine if the content makes sense in relation to the quality attribute description or if it is a false positive.

Data:

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Output your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""
}
",True,"The provided content is about improving the accuracy of duplication calculation, which is not directly related to the quality attribute of Security."
