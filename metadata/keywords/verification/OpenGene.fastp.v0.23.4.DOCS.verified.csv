",False,"The provided content appears to be documentation and installation instructions for a software tool called fastp.

Availability," should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_accuracy level | hash buffer number | buffer size | memory usage | speed | |; |- | - | - | - | - | - |; | 1 | 1 | 1G | 1G | ultra-fast | default for no-dedup mode |; | 2 | 1 | 2G | 2G | fast | |; | 3 | 2 | 2G | 4G | fast | default for dedup|; | 4 | 2 | 4G | 8G | fast | |; | 5 | 2 | 8G | 12G | fast | |; | 6 | 3 | 8G | 24G | moderate | |. ## deduplication; Since `v0.22.0`, fastp supports deduplication for FASTQ data. Specify `-D` or `--dedup` to enable this option. When `--dedup` is enabled, the `dup_calc_accuracy` level is default to `3`, and it can be changed to any value of 1 ~ 6. # all options; ```shell; usage: fastp -i <in1> -o <out1> [-I <in1> -O <out2>] ",down,MatchSource.DOCS,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md:28608,downstream,28608,README.md,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md,1,['down'],['downstream'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

This value is 10 by default. # polyX tail trimming; This feature is similar as polyG tail trimming, but is disabled by default. Use `-x` or `--trim_poly_x` to enable it. A minimum length can be set with `<poly_x_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyX. This value is 10 by default. When `polyG tail trimming` and `polyX tail trimming` are both enabled, fastp will perform `polyG trimming` first, then perform `polyX trimming`. This setting is useful for trimming the tails having `polyX (i.e. polyA) ` before `polyG`. `polyG` is usually caused by sequencing artifacts, while `polyA` can be commonly found from the tails of mRNA-Seq reads. # unique molecular identifier (UMI) processing; UMI is useful for duplication elimination and error correction based on generating consensus of reads originated from a same DNA fragment. It's usually used in deep sequencing applications like ctDNA sequencing. Commonly for Illumina platforms, UMIs can be integrated in two different places: `index` or head of `read`.  ; To enable UMI processing, you have to enable `-U` or `--umi` option in the command line, and specify `--umi_loc` to specify the UMI location, it can be one of:; * `index1` the first index is used as UMI. If the data is PE, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.; * `index2` the second index is used as UMI. PE data only, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.; * `read1` the head of read1 is used as UMI. If the data is PE, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.; * `read2` the head of read2 is used as UMI. PE data only, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.; * `per_index` `index1_index2` is used as UMI for both read1/read2.; * `per_read` define `umi1` as the head of read1, and `umi2` as the head

If one read passes the filters but its pair doesn't, the `failure reason` will be `paired_read_is_failing`.; ## process only part of the data; If you don't want to process all the data, you can specify `--reads_to_process` to limit the reads to be processed. This is useful if you want to have a fast preview of the data quality, or you want to create a subset of the filtered data.; ## do not overwrite exiting files; You can enable the option `--dont_overwrite` to protect the existing files not to be overwritten by `fastp`. In this case, `fastp` will report an error and quit if it finds any of the output files (read1, read2, json report, html report) already exists before.; ## split the output to multiple files for parallel processing; See [output splitting](#output-splitting); ## merge PE reads; See [merge paired-end reads](#merge-paired-end-reads). # filtering; Multiple filters have been implemented.; ## quality filter; Quality filtering is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-Q` or `disable_quality_filtering`. Currently it supports filtering by limiting the N base number (`-n, --n_base_limit`), and the percentage of unqualified bases.  . To filter reads by its percentage of unqualified bases, two options should be provided:; * `-q, --qualified_quality_phred`       the quality value that a base is qualified. Default 15 means phred quality >=Q15 is qualified.; * `-u, --unqualified_percent_limit`   how many percents of bases are allowed to be unqualified (0~100). Default 40 means 40%. You can also filter reads by its average quality score; * `-e, --average_qual` if on

If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contain

However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content:  default value 0 means no limitation. ## low complexity filter; Low complexity filter is disabled by default, and you can enable it by `-y` or `--low_complexity_filter`. The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]). For example:; ```; # a 51-bp sequence, with 3 bases that is different from its next base; seq = 'AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCCCC'; complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%; ```; The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you

Content: -complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contain

This is similar as the Trimmomatic `SLIDINGWINDOW` method. ***WARNING: all these three operations will interfere deduplication for SE data, and `--cut_front` or `--cut_right` may also interfere deduplication for PE data.

If `--cut_right` is enabled together with `--cut_front`, `--cut_front` will be performed first before `--cut_right` to avoid dropping whole reads due to the low quality starting bases. Please be noted that `--cut_front` will interfere deduplication for both PE/SE data, and `--cut_tail` will interfere deduplication for SE data, since the deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content includes instructions for downloading, building, and configuring software components (e.g., libisal, libdeflate, fastp), which are about how to use the tool rather than addressing user interface aspects. The attribute of usability focuses on how well the system can be used by users in terms of ease of learning, efficiency, and user satisfaction. The provided content does not discuss user interfaces or navigation but instead details installation and setup procedures. Therefore, it doesn't align with the usability quality attribute."
