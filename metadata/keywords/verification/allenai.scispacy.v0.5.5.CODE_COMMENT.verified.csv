You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing quality attributes in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to distinguish sentences that clearly relate to a given quality attribute from those that do not. 

Evaluate whether the content accurately aligns with its associated quality attribute, given the context provided. Your goal is to determine if the content makes sense in relation to the quality attribute description or if it is a false positive.

Data:

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: # this is really just testing that we handle the case where pysbd crashes

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
