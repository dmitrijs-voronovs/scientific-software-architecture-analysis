ISSUE_COMMENT,Energy Efficiency,28,schedul,scheduling,"Cool! This is exactly the kind of interface I was envisioning. I do have a few thoughts about this. I think the ability to attach multiple `Executor`s to a `Process` would be really cool, and I think the notion of an ""ActiveExecutor"" might limit this capability. Instead, one should be able to add many `Executor`s to a `Process`, and the `Process` becomes responsible for distributing `Tasks` among its attached `Executor`s. This would require some sort of scheduling algorithm to be included in the `Run` method of `Process`, but this could be made a simple as you like (just a simple round robin algorithm to start, and we could get fancy with it later).

Content: Cool! This is exactly the kind of interface I was envisioning. I do have a few thoughts about this. I think the ability to attach multiple `Executor`s to a `Process` would be really cool, and I think the notion of an ""ActiveExecutor"" might limit this capability. Instead, one should be able to add many `Executor`s to a `Process`, and the `Process` becomes responsible for distributing `Tasks` among its attached `Executor`s. This would require some sort of scheduling algorithm to be included in the `Run` method of `Process`, but this could be made a simple as you like (just a simple round robin algorithm to start, and we could get fancy with it later). So to sketch what I'm thinking, an `Executor` should have channels for incoming and completed `Task`s:. ```golang; type Executor interface {; // This function just receives a Task, and returns an error if ; /// the Executor can't take any more tasks at the moment; ReceiveTask(t *Task) Error; // This should be a loop that runs continuously and executes; // tasks as they are received.

We want users to be able to type a simple command like `./hellbender ToolName [toolArgs] --sparkMaster X`, and have hellbender figure out whether to invoke `spark-submit` or `gcloud dataproc` on their behalf, and provide sensible defaults for all relevant spark options. . Perhaps there is a way in `SparkCommandLineProgram` to detect whether an option has already been set externally, and allow the default to be overridden if it has been?

That means that arrays of things implementing `__array__` should be safely representable as `ndarray`, which clearly isn't true for us.

That's the reason `scipy.sparse` types don't implement `__array__`.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: After talking a bit with @ali-ramadhan, I think we might have settled on the following solution:. * Introduce a new type called `PhysicalParameters` that holds `g` and `ρ0`; * Introduce a new abstract type called `Rotation` (or some such) that encodes information about the background rotation rate of the model --- `TangentPlane` with `f` and `β`, and possibly non-traditional Coriolis parameters, another type for the sphere, etc.; * Group viscous and diffusive transport coefficients into the upcoming `TurbulenceClosure` type, allowing for isotropic constant transport coefficients, anisotropic constant coefficients, or nonlinear closure schemes. These changes will also require us to compute buoyancy rather than a density perturbation, and may motivate us to simplify the code by defining variables in `pressures` as having units of the 'kinematic pressure', which is the ordinary pressure divided by `ρ0`.

ISSUE_COMMENT,Modifiability,3803,config,configuration,"> My question was: is it possible to modify the ROOT-cmake-find script, so that it only forces the nlohmann-json-dependency if you are going to use ROOT7 classes? So to say, that depending on the `REQUIRED COMPONENTS` that you use in the `find_package` statement in your user code, it is more or less 'requiring'. That's an interesting question. 🤔 CMake project's can't easily do this. I mean, nothing is impossible, but it's not simple to do. As long as externals are handled through imported library targets (which I'm not sure the nlohmann_json dependency is used with 😕), one would need to tweak the behaviour of CMake in a pretty fundamental way for this. 🤔 You see, when you tell in (in this case) ROOT's build that library `Foo` needs to publicly link against library `Bar::bar`, CMake exports this information in the `ROOTConfig-targets.cmake` file. (That is a file generated fully by CMake itself.) It will say that `Foo` depends on `Bar::bar`. So at that point `ROOTConfig.cmake` has to produce `Bar::bar` in some way. Even if the user's code itself never wants to use the `Foo` library. Because CMake will not like it that it has the `Foo` library defined (even if unused by others), without all of its requirements met. So even if `ROOTConfig.cmake` itself doesn't look for nlohmann_json, if any of the CMake code depends on the `nlhmann::json` target (yes, there is such a target in CMake 😄), the CMake configuration would still fail.

ISSUE_COMMENT,Performance,438,perform,perform,"@falexwolf I try to answer where I can. I should probably have clarified a bit above. I would argue that most real data DE tests benefit from accounting for technical covariates. For example, you should probably not perform batch correction on your data and then do a wilcoxon rank sum test, but instead take the normalized (and log transformed) data or the raw counts and include a batch covariate in the test. This also holds for technical covariates that describe the complexity of the data (such as size factors or n_genes). Often these factors are not sufficiently accounted for by simple normalization techniques (especially for plate-based data), and are thus included in the DE testing framework.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: @falexwolf I try to answer where I can. I should probably have clarified a bit above. I would argue that most real data DE tests benefit from accounting for technical covariates. For example, you should probably not perform batch correction on your data and then do a wilcoxon rank sum test, but instead take the normalized (and log transformed) data or the raw counts and include a batch covariate in the test. This also holds for technical covariates that describe the complexity of the data (such as size factors or n_genes). Often these factors are not sufficiently accounted for by simple normalization techniques (especially for plate-based data), and are thus included in the DE testing framework. This is done in MAST (and MAST performs better with this `detRate` covariate in the Soneson & Robinson paper you cite above), and it is also done in a recent negative binomial DE test from [Mayer et al, Nature 2018](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature25999).

Reports like this are a model of what every developer wishes a user did before filing an issue :). First, let me clear up what seems like might be a small source of confusion. Since both of the salmon runs are from v1.1.0, _neither_ of these are making use of quasi-mapping. Specifically, newer versions of salmon _only_ perform selective alignment (and this makes the `--validateMappings` command line argument redundant in newer versions, though we keep it so as to maximize backward compatibility with command line parameters people may be using). So, the main difference between your two salmon runs is inclusion of the decoy set. This almost certainly means that the reads that map in your second set of salmon runs but not your first are being assigned to decoys in the first case. To try and get a better handle on this, could you upload a `meta_info.json` file from both runs? This file lives in the `aux_info` directory, and it will provide information about e.g. how many reads were best mapped to decoys and were discarded for this reason. The guarantee you get from the selective alignment is that, if the fragment is discarded by decoy mapping, it maps _strictly better_ to the decoy than to the non-decoy sequence. There are many reasons this could happen. One is rRNA contamination, another could be that reads are coming from processed pseudogenes that are not properly in your annotation, yet a third is that your sample has a considerable fraction of reads spanning exon-intron junctions (in this case, the read will map better to the corresponding location on the genome, and worse to the annotate transcript where the intronic sequence is not present).

Note that selective alignment may _still_ be a bit more conservative than STAR about softclips simply because of the nature of the scoring function it uses. This might give you a sense if one of these alignment methodologies is more consistent with your expectations in this case. Another option is to consider doing a grouping with `terminus`.

If yes, is it possible to access the argv in the .py file when it is used from the .scn file? Or is it possible to improve the implementation such that it can handle it?

ISSUE_COMMENT,Security,3336,expose,exposes,"Okay, apologies. I just didn't quite understand what you meant when you said they _seem_ identical. Typically we would just write something like `T1 == T2`, which will return `true` or `false`, or equivalently something like `all(T1 .== T2)`. Another test is to use `isapprox` (also written `≈`) as in `all(T1 .≈ T2)`. Here's a bit more background on the reproducibility tests we currently have:. We have [""regression tests""](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/main/test/regression_tests) that test to ensure that output from a certain simulation remains identical across PRs, including tests that involve LES closures. These tests involve ~10 time steps. We conclude that results are ""identical"" when every grid point is within `sqrt(eps(T))`, where `T` is the floating point type (eg `Float64` or `Float32`), for example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/fc84215f76661e9f1cfb103dc18f86442cec9d89/test/regression_tests/hydrostatic_free_turbulence_regression_test.jl#L112.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: @jigold Ok I changed this in a way that will hopefully be more clear. The rules are as follows:. 1. We only use `ci-intermediate` for anonymous images. Images are named auth, batch, etc. even when they are in tests or dev deploys.; 1. Every image draws from the main branch cache tag, named `<DOCKER_PREFIX>/<image_name>:cache`; 2. Every image has an additional cache tag that it draws from and pushes to. For deploys, that is the same as the main branch cache, for PRs, it is `cache-pr-<pr_number>`, for dev deploys it is `cache-<dev_username>`, and for deploys conducted by CIs in a non-default namespace, it is `cache-<namespace-CI-is-in>-deploy`.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.

As said: it doesn’t happen automatically on desktops, they show you a popup asking you to do it. I think the HPC servers don’t help you with your tiny $HOME, so everything you download manually or cache just stays there. On a well-configured system with little space in $HOME, you’d have $XDG_CACHE_DIR point to a separate disk that has more space and isn’t backupped. In an ideal world everyone would respect that and your $HOME would never be filled up with ephemeral files. > I'm not sure I'd want to support a command line interface just for configs, if there was more it could do, maybe. Also, there's gotta be a generic tool for this, right?. The idea we agreed on was to allow something similar as `jupyter`: Just delegate `scanpy foocmd` to `scanpy-foocmd` except for

Given that you have tried samtools faidx it without issue, I think this is probably not the issue, but might still be good to check. @Roj4ck if you have more suggestions on this, please feel free to chime in!

RELEASES,Deployability,80,release,release,"# Salmon 0.13.1 release notes. Version 0.13.1 is a patch to 0.13.0. We describe the contents of the patch here, and repeat the v0.13.0 release notes again below for simplicity. * This version fixes a non-determinism bug introduced in v0.13.0 that could cause the mapping rate of _orphaned_ mappings to fluctuate slightly between runs. * This version adds the `--allowDovetail` flag which overrides the newly-default behavior of discarding dovetail mappings of paired-end reads. If passed this flag, salmon will not consider dovetailing mappings as discordant, and will consider them. . * The following fields have been added to `meta_info.json`:; * `num_dovetail_fragments` : which denotes the number of fragments that have _only_ dovetailing mappings. If the `--allowDovetail` flag was passed, these are counted toward quantification, otherwise they are discarded (but this number is still reported). This field only has a meaningful value in quasi-mapping mode (with or without mapping validation).; * `num_fragments_filtered_vm` : which denotes the number of fragments that had a mapping to the transcriptome, but which were discarded because _none_ of the mappings for the fragments exceeded the minimum mapping validation score. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0).; * `num_alignments_below_threshold_for_mapped_fragments_vm` : which denotes the number of _mappings_ discarded because they failed to reach the minimum mapping validation score, but for which the corresponding fragment had at least a single valid mapping. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0). ## Previous Salmon 0.13.0 release notes. ## Change to default behavior.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: # Salmon 0.13.1 release notes. Version 0.13.1 is a patch to 0.13.0. We describe the contents of the patch here, and repeat the v0.13.0 release notes again below for simplicity. * This version fixes a non-determinism bug introduced in v0.13.0 that could cause the mapping rate of _orphaned_ mappings to fluctuate slightly between runs. * This version adds the `--allowDovetail` flag which overrides the newly-default behavior of discarding dovetail mappings of paired-end reads. If passed this flag, salmon will not consider dovetailing mappings as discordant, and will consider them. . * The following fields have been added to `meta_info.json`:; * `num_dovetail_fragments` : which denotes the number of fragments that have _only_ dovetailing mappings. If the `--allowDovetail` flag was passed, these are counted toward quantification, otherwise they are discarded (but this number is still reported). This field only has a meaningful value in quasi-mapping mode (with or without mapping validation).; * `num_fragments_filtered_vm` : which denotes the number of fragments that had a mapping to the transcriptome, but which were discarded because _none_ of the mappings for the fragments exceeded the minimum mapping validation score. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0).; * `num_alignments_below_threshold_for_mapped_fragments_vm` : which denotes the number of _mappings_ discarded because they failed to reach the minimum mapping validation score, but for which the corresponding fragment had at least a single valid mapping. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0). ## Previous Salmon 0.13.0 release notes. ## Change to default behavior. Starting from this version of salmon, dovetailed mappings (see the [Bowtie2 manual](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#mates-can-overlap-contain-or-dovetail-each-other) for a description) are _not_ accepted by default usi

Note that it's not the dftd4 executable that's needed but the dftd4 Python module. For linux, this is distributed via `conda install dftd4 -c psi4`. It is also available as `conda install dftd4-python -c conda-forge`, but that's trickier to get it and Psi4 dependencies installed together happily.; - QCSchema runs now return the input and other selected text files in the `AtomicResult.native_files` field, controllable by `AtomicInput.protocols.native_files` setting (#2361). ## Performance Optimizations. - Direct SCF jobs can now use density screening and incremental Fock build (#2155).; - DIIS routines have been vectorized in preparation for their refactoring to Python (#2355). ## Details of Interest. - Linear response enabled for UHF references (#2266).; - Fix SCF memory leak and `Vector::dgemv` error. Not an correctness issue (#2347).; - MBIS charges and volume ratios separated as OEProp tasks (#2273).; - Save gradient and Hessian results from finite difference more thoroughly in QCVars (#2293).; - Add DFTensor class for better recording and manipulating density cummulant theory (DCT) (#2250).; - Fix some memory leaks or memory

RELEASES,Energy Efficiency,2,reduce,reduced,"New features; ============. * Salmon learned the ability to optionally write quality values in output SAM files.

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content: New features; ============. * Salmon learned the ability to optionally write quality values in output SAM files.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: New features & improvements; ---------------------------. * This release includes a refactoring and optimization of the mapping code in `--sketch` mode, further increasing speed; output should remain identical. * This release adds the `--splitSeqV1` and `--splitSeqV2` flags, that have been the development release for a bit, as simple alternatives to custom geometry when processing SPLiT-seq data for `alevin-fry` or `alevin` processing. Fixes; -----. * No particular bug fixes are noted for this release. Other changes / enhancements; -------------------------------. * Explicitly check for valid value of `k` before calling out to the indexer. This leads to a more informative error message and exit if the user passes an unacceptable value of `k`. .

RELEASES,Modifiability,29,flexible,flexible,"**This is a pre-release.**. QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``, ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations, and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: **This is a pre-release.**. QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``, ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations, and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``.

Full list of changes in this release:. * `Mutect2`; * Made `Mutect2` active region determination much better for low allele fractions (#4832); * In particular, this makes `Mutect2` vastly better for mitochondrial and cfDNA calling; * `Mutect2` can now emit MNPs according to adjustable distance threshold specified via `--max-mnp-distance` (#4650); * Tweaked `Mutect2` read position filter to handle non-biological (eg FFPE) insertions better (#4851); * Fixed `Mutect2` bug where triallelic normal artifacts were sometimes hidden from filtering engine (#4809); * `Mutect2` STR filter now also looks at insertions (#4845); * This lowers the indel false positive rate dramatically.; * `Mutect2 WDL`: ; * now outputs MAF segmentation (#4837); * now runs `FilterAlignmentArtifacts` (#4848); * now uses lenient validation in `SortSam` (#4844). * Added new tool `FilterAlignmentArtifacts` (#4698); * Filters false positive alignment artifacts (that is, apparent variants due to reads being mapped to the wrong genomic locus) from a VCF callset by checking variant-supporting reads and their mates.; * By considering the realignment of the read and its mate, it saves a lot of variants, especially in low-complexity regions, from being filtered as mapping errors. * `HaplotypeCaller`; * `HaplotypeCaller` can now emit MNPs according to adjust

RELEASES,Safety,105,safe,safe,"sitions on a single transcript, this allows for improved mapping, since multiple positions for the individual reads will be propagated to the algorithm that selects the best mapping for the pair (which can take into account the expected pairing constraints). * Added new flag in mapping validation mode `--maxMMPExtension` (default value of 7). This flag limits the length of the MMP by which a match between the suffix array and read can be extended. Smaller values for this parameter can potentially increase the mapping sensitivity at the cost of requiring more suffix array lookups. The default value should generally work well, and increases the sensitivity with respect to unconstrained mapping validation with little impact on runtime.

Quality Attribute: Safety
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: sitions on a single transcript, this allows for improved mapping, since multiple positions for the individual reads will be propagated to the algorithm that selects the best mapping for the pair (which can take into account the expected pairing constraints). * Added new flag in mapping validation mode `--maxMMPExtension` (default value of 7). This flag limits the length of the MMP by which a match between the suffix array and read can be extended. Smaller values for this parameter can potentially increase the mapping sensitivity at the cost of requiring more suffix array lookups. The default value should generally work well, and increases the sensitivity with respect to unconstrained mapping validation with little impact on runtime.

RELEASES,Safety,31,avoid,avoid,"This is a minor release, but it nonetheless adds a few important features and fixes an outstanding bug. This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed.

RELEASES,Security,106,validat,validation,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

RELEASES,Testability,56,benchmark,benchmarking,"This is a major stable release of salmon and brings a lot of exciting new features with extensive benchmarking in the latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). This new version of salmon is based on a fundamentally different indexing data structure ([pufferfish](http://bit.ly/2m1OSr3)) than the previous version. It also adopts a different mapping algorithm; a variant of selective-alignment. The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthll` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta2; A bug r",,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.0.0,"The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection.

RELEASES,Usability,3,learn,learned,"New features; ============. * Salmon learned the ability to optionally write quality values in output SAM files. If the `--writeQualities` flag is passed to `salmon` when mappings are also being written (i.e. with `--writeMappings=`), then the SAM records for reads will contain the corresponding quality values. **Note**: You should *not* pass this flag to `salmon` if you are providing `FASTA` rather than `FASTQ` files as input; those files have no quality values, and so this flag is not compatible with `FASTA` input. **Note**: The default behavior remains to *not* write quality values, as they are not necessary for many downstream applications and they consume considerable extra space in the output. This addresses the feature request in #756; thanks to @A-N-Other for the suggestion. Fixes; =====. * Addressing #748, raised by @taylorreiter - In single-end mode, *all* unmapped reads were being reported with the code `u`, including those mapped to decoys. This release fixes the output so the proper code `d`, is reported for those fragments best mapping to decoys. . Improvements; ============. * When `salmon` `alevin` was being run upstream of `alevin-fry` for generating a RAD file, it was possible for the file to be truncated if there was insufficient disk space for the output. This release of `salmon` adds a final check of the `ofstream` after the call to `close` to determine if the stream is in a bad state. This should lead to better error reporting and proper exit codes if the RAD output of `salmon` `alevin` is unexpectedly truncated. Thanks to @allyhawkins for helping to uncover this issue. * The use of multi-stage builds has greatly reduced the size of the Docker image to ~101MB (from ~1.38G); thanks to @kaczmarj for contributing this improvement. * Improvements to the documentation have been made and some typos fidex thanks to @molecules. **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0",,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.9.0,"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

If the `--writeQualities` flag is passed to `salmon` when mappings are also being written (i.e. with `--writeMappings=`), then the SAM records for reads will contain the corresponding quality values. **Note**: You should *not* pass this flag to `salmon` if you are providing `FASTA` rather than `FASTQ` files as input; those files have no quality values, and so this flag is not compatible with `FASTA` input. **Note**: The default behavior remains to *not* write quality values, as they are not necessary for many downstream applications and they consume considerable extra space in the output. This addresses the feature request in #756; thanks to @A-N-Other for the suggestion. Fixes; =====. * Addressing #748, raised by @taylorreiter - In single-end mode, *all* unmapped reads were being reported with the code `u`, including those mapped to decoys. This release fixes the output so the proper code `d`, is reported for those fragments best mapping to decoys. . Improvements; ============. * When `salmon` `alevin` was being run upstream of `alevin-fry` for generating a RAD file, it was possible for the file to be truncated if there was insufficient disk space for the output. This release of `salmon` adds a final check of the `ofstream` after the call to `close` to determine if the stream is in a bad state. This should lead to better error reporting and proper exit codes if the RAD output of `salmon` `alevin` is unexpectedly truncated. Thanks to @allyhawkins for helping to uncover this issue. * The use of multi-stage builds has greatly reduced the size of the Docker image to ~101MB (from ~1.38G); thanks to @kaczmarj for contributing this improvement. * Improvements to the documentation have been made and some typos fidex thanks to @molecules. **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0

You can read more about these in the Doublet Detection chapter of Single Cell Best Practices. Normalization#; The next preprocessing step is normalization. A common approach is count depth scaling with subsequent log plus one (log1p) transformation. Count depth scaling normalizes the data to a “size factor” such as the median count depth in the dataset, ten thousand (CP10k) or one million (CPM, counts per million). The size factor for count depth scaling can be controlled via target_sum in pp.normalize_total.

Content:  out any clusters with high doublet scores. See also; Alternative methods for doublet detection within the scverse ecosystem are DoubletDetection and SOLO. You can read more about these in the Doublet Detection chapter of Single Cell Best Practices. Normalization#; The next preprocessing step is normalization. A common approach is count depth scaling with subsequent log plus one (log1p) transformation. Count depth scaling normalizes the data to a “size factor” such as the median count depth in the dataset, ten thousand (CP10k) or one million (CPM, counts per million). The size factor for count depth scaling can be controlled via target_sum in pp.normalize_total. We are applying median count depth normalization with log1p transformation (AKA log1PF). # Saving count data; adata.layers[""counts""] = adata.X.copy(). # Normalizing to median total counts; sc.pp.normalize_total(adata); # Logarithmize the data; sc.pp.log1p(adata). Feature selection#; As a next step, we want to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and only include the most informative genes. This step is commonly known as feature selection. The scanpy function pp.highly_variable_genes annotates highly variable genes by reproducing the implementations of Seurat [Satija et al., 2015], Cell Ranger [Zheng et al., 2017], and Seurat v3 [Stuart et al., 2019] depending on the chosen flavor. sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=2000, batch_key=""sample""). sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata). Dimensionality Reduction#; Reduce the dimensionality of the data by running principal component analysis (PCA), which reveals the main axes of variation and denoises the data. sc.tl.pca(adata). Let us inspect the contribution of single PCs to the total variance in the data. This gives us information about how many PCs we should consider in order to compute the neighborhood relations of cells, e.g. used in the clustering function leiden() or tsne(). In our experience, there does not seem to be signifigant downside to over

Preprocessing and clustering 3k PBMCs (legacy workflow)#; In May 2017, this started out as a demonstration that Scanpy would allow to reproduce most of Seurat’s guided clustering tutorial (Satija et al., 2015).; We gratefully acknowledge Seurat’s authors for the tutorial! In the meanwhile, we have added and removed a few pieces.; The data consist of 3k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor and are freely available from 10x Genomics (here from this webpage). On a unix system, you can uncomment and run the following to download and unpack the data. The last line creates a directory for writing processed data. # !mkdir data; # !wget http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-exp/1.1.0/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz -O data/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz; # !cd data; tar -xzf pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz; # !mkdir write. Note; Download the notebook by clicking on the Edit on GitHub button. On GitHub, you can download using the Raw button via right-click and Save Link As. Alternatively, download the whole scanpy-tutorial repository. Note; In Jupyter notebooks and lab,
