Previously we required Java 8, which is now end-of-life. ; * Newer non-LTS Java releases such as Java 18 or Java 19 may work as well, but since they are untested by us we only officially support running with Java 17. * Significant enhancements to `SelectVariants`, including arguments to enable `GVCF` filtering support and to work with genotype fields more easily. * A new tool `SVConcordance`, that calculates SV genotype concordance between an ""evaluation"" VCF and a ""truth"" VCF. * Bug fixes and enhancements to the support for the Ultima Genomics flow-based sequencing platform introduced in GATK 4.3.0.0. **Full list of changes:**; -------------------------. * **Flow-based Variant Calling**; * `FlowFeatureMapper`: added surrounding-median-quality-size feature (#8222); * Removed hardcoded limit on max homopolymer call (#8088); * Fixed bug in dynamic read disqualification (#8171); * Fixed a bug in the parsing of the T0 tag (#8185); * Updated flow-based calling `Mutect2` parameters to make them consistent with the `HaplotypeCaller` parameters (#8186); ; * **SelectVariants**; * Enabled GVCF type filtering support in `SelectVariants` (#7193); * Added an optional argument `--ignore-non-ref-in-types` to support correct handling of VariantContexts that contain a NON_REF allele. This is necessary because every variant in a GVCF file would otherwise be assigned the type MIXED, which makes it impossible to filter for e.g. SNPs.; * Note that this only enables correct handling of GVCF input.

See [our blog post on DRAGEN-GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360039984151-DRAGEN-GATK-Update-Let-s-get-more-specific) for more details on these improvements. A full `DRAGEN-GATK` pipeline that leverages these new features will be released in the near future as a WDL workflow script in the [WARP](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp) repo on GitHub as well as a featured workspace in [Terra](https://terra.bio/). ; * Below is a summary of the improvements we've ported from DRAGEN in this release. We recommend that most users wait until the complete `DRAGEN-GATK` pipeline is released as a WDL workflow before evaluating these features, though advanced users comfortable with building their own pipelines are welcome

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing quality attributes in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to distinguish sentences that clearly relate to a given quality attribute from those that do not. 

Evaluate whether the content accurately aligns with its associated quality attribute, given the context provided. Your goal is to determine if the content makes sense in relation to the quality attribute description or if it is a false positive.

Data:

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Output your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""
}
",True,"The provided content primarily relates to technical fixes, code improvements, and bug fixes, rather than aspects of usability as defined by the attribute description."
