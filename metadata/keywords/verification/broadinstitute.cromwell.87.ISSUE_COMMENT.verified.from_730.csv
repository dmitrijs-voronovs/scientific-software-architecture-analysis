Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Hi @multimeric ,. Thank you so much for providing the current location of those links. . I still have a question regarding the solution proposed here. In the current documentation website, I could not find the guidance or CloudFormation for creating a custom AMI, which is described above. And moreover, I also could not find the description saying that ""The AMI type needs to be specified as 'cromwell' and the Scratch mount point needs to be specified as \cromwell_mount"", which was mentioned above as the solution. . Is it because the whole creation procedure has been changed since then? In the current documentation, I only found [this link](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/core-env/create-custom-compute-resources.html#custom-amis) which only briefly talked about creating a custom AMI but not gave any CloudFormation link. Do you know where I should look for this information? Thanks!. Also, thank you for letting me know about the Genomics CLI.

Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: I included some changes in #4961 that might work for this enhancement request. The changes in that PR publish ""workflowProcessingEvents"" for workflow pickup, release, and completion. The first two events types can be multi-valued since Cromwell can be restarted and possibly upgraded during the execution of a workflow.

Content: Would it be possible to use realistic paths, perhaps the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`? And to make variables explicitly clear (and in quotes), maybe ""${docker_subbed}.sif"" instead of $docker_subbed.sif. The goal would be to have a general script that can work for most, correct?

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.

Color coding suggests that they are `connected components`, but the meaning is still not clear to me. Also, maybe `connected component` is not the best term in this case, since its strong ties with graph theory (unless this is exactly what it means here)?

I can understand the temptation to use this for ""the greater good"" :wink: . But I am quite happy that the Cromwell developers chose to be in touch with the community and aggressively implement the development spec in the development version of Cromwell. This allows us to see how certain spec changes turn out *before* they get implemented in production. In this case I came across this when I was testing the code for #5312 and found that I could not set my resource requirements for BWA anymore (in BioWDL all tasks default to the least number of cores needed, and sometimes you want to override this for more power). Since BWA was nested in a subworkflow this turned out not to be possible. So now we can fix the spec and Cromwell before this ever gets into a release. I think it is great work by the Cromwell team. It can't always be easy to follow the spec that closely.

This would need to be selected in the configuration file with an authorization with `scheme = ""service_account""` but instead both the configuration file for [PAPIv2](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/PipelinesApi101/#setting-up-papiv2) and the configuration file for [PAPIv1](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/PipelinesApi101/#lets-get-started) are configured to use an authorization with `scheme = ""application_default""`. I find it very hard to believe that any novel user could go through the tutorial and successfully set up a Cromwell server. On a slightly different note, some of my issues would be resolved if I could run jobs using my user account rather than a service account associated with my project. In the Google [backends](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/) section of the docs there is a lonely mention of the `scheme = ""user_account""` but no further explanation. According to the [source code](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/cloudSupport/src/test/scala/cromwell/cloudsupport/gcp/GoogleConfigurationSpec.scala) it should be defined as:; ```; {; name = ""user-account""; scheme = ""user_account""; user = ""me""; secrets-file = ""/very/secret/file.txt""; data-store-dir = ""/where/the/data/at""; }; ```; But I was not able to get it to work.

Quality Attribute: Performance

Content: @mcovarr I also echo @cwhelan that the solution provided is quite cumbersome. What exactly would be the complexity in devising a solution where instead you could simply define a variable like `backend.providers.#name.config.root` (say for example `backend.providers.#name.config.cache`) that indicates where the docker images should be cached and maybe an option to specify whether downloading the image in the cache directory is something that needs to be done for all tasks or only for scattered tasks. I don't see why it should be left to the user to perform the caching manually. This would be more similar to what was hacked for the shared filesystem backend in #5063 and maybe a more general solution non-specific to the PAPIv2 backend would eliminate the need for such a hack. The problem still remains that developers would need to rely on users to configure Cromwell appropriately.

In Python, if I try to do_something() on a variable that isn't defined, Python throws a Name Error, but in Cromwell!WDL trying to do_something() on an optional throws a ""Expected X but got X?"" error that doesn't tell you if X is actually defined or not. The fact that the WDL spec doesn't explicitly say that defined() can coerce a variable doesn't really matter -- I would wager that most people would expect this sort of thing to work. It seems to be a logical conclusion that if a file exists, you can do something to that file, without having to call a totally different function to create a new variable. I did check your workaround, but it throws the same error. So, my understanding is the only way to do this in Cromwell is this:. ```; String basename_tsv = basename(select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""])); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. ...which just isn't intuitive. It shouldn't be so complicated to get the basename of an optional file. . Even less intuitive is the fact that if you separate out the select_first() part into a new variable, my workaround doesn't work anymore. ```; String maybe_tsv = select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""]); String basename_tsv = basename(maybe_tsv); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. _Failed to process task definition 'parse_terratable' (reason 1 of 1): Failed to process expression 'select_first([basename_tsv, basename(maybe_tsv)])' (reason 1 of 1): Invalid parameter 'IdentifierLookup(maybe_tsv)'. Expected 'File' but got 'String?'_. In other words -- it is unnecessarily complicated to work with optionals, and the workarounds that do exist appear to be inconsistent. It seems this could all be sidestepped by having ""if X exists, do something to X"" logic. (I want to make clear I'm coming at this from a perspective of someone who uses W

Originally, this was created because we hoped that Google had an alternative to Batch requests, by now, Google has confirmed that there is no way to do that. These are some notes from our internal discussions:; 1. The code becomes way simpler if this grouping gets removed.; 2. We have not checked the potential implications on creating a batch client for every request, or, reusing the same client for the application's lifecycle.; 3.
