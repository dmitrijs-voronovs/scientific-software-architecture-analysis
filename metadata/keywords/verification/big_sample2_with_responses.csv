ISSUE_COMMENT,Availability,898,mainten,maintenance," what the ""Ways to Add Code"" page is supposed to accomplish. There's nothing unifying these sections together, and even individual sections seem disjointed to me. The easier and more rapid development section feels like one part expositing historical developments and one part trying to sell the new developer on the transition to Python. The Psi4Numpy and plugins sections read like one part overviewing the process of going from equations to code and again like one part trying to sell the new developer on NumPy. The ""incorporating code into Psi4"" section reads like a guide on parceling code into C++ parts and Python parts. 2. Are you expecting the reader to already know about dual-language software and OpenMP? The current documentation is written as if you are, but I didn't know about the first one until after I had started working in Psi, and I still only have a hazy idea on the second. 3. I fear that the strategy of ""mostly the vanilla contributor covenant, but with small additions to emphasize that we value inexperienced devs"" will lead to those small additions not being noticed by the inexperienced devs. When I see something as general as, ""to help us maintain this vibrant; and productive atmosphere,"" my immediate thought is that this is administrative babble and only worth skimming.

Content:  what the ""Ways to Add Code"" page is supposed to accomplish. There's nothing unifying these sections together, and even individual sections seem disjointed to me. The easier and more rapid development section feels like one part expositing historical developments and one part trying to sell the new developer on the transition to Python. The Psi4Numpy and plugins sections read like one part overviewing the process of going from equations to code and again like one part trying to sell the new developer on NumPy. The ""incorporating code into Psi4"" section reads like a guide on parceling code into C++ parts and Python parts. 2. Are you expecting the reader to already know about dual-language software and OpenMP? The current documentation is written as if you are, but I didn't know about the first one until after I had started working in Psi, and I still only have a hazy idea on the second. 3. I fear that the strategy of ""mostly the vanilla contributor covenant, but with small additions to emphasize that we value inexperienced devs"" will lead to those small additions not being noticed by the inexperienced devs. When I see something as general as, ""to help us maintain this vibrant; and productive atmosphere,"" my immediate thought is that this is administrative babble and only worth skimming.

ISSUE_COMMENT,Energy Efficiency,854,efficient,efficient,"Hi @Axze-rgb,. This clearly tells me that your organism is highly sensitive under selective pressure. So let's think what might happen if you used Clair3. Clair3 has both a full-alignment network (ResNet), and a pileup network (Bi-LSTM). . Bi-LSTM is just a recurrent neural network that is memory efficient to remember past events without gradient instabilities, by going through the input forward and in reverse while getting output information from the previous step. All this means is that it has a bunch of weights and biases that the input (and previous output) progresses through in a time-series-like pattern -- traversing the input data both forward and in reverse -- remembering internally long-term dependencies stored as states. This means it is fairly memory efficient and fairly fast. In terms of sequence it captures the variants given a progression known by past progressions. As an analogy, given sequence of historical stock prices, can you predict the future stock price. Instead of stock price it produces variants. The ResNet is helpful to train faster as it is uses skip (shortcut) connection by utilizing the residual difference of input and output to learn from (residual learning). They use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) for variable coverage of full-alignments. This still a convolutional neural network of weights and biases. It still operates like DeepVariant on channels constructed from your read information (`reference_base`, `alternative_base`, `mapping_quality`, `base_quality`, `strand_info`, `variant_type`, `insert_base`, `phasing_info`). What does this mean for you? We know your organism adapts significantly to the external environment. The deep learning models -- either DeepVariant or Clair3 -- have semi-fixed input assumptions.

I think we should use that everywhere, and just use the auth0 id to look up the user record during login. So the integer id would be the primary key and the auth0 id would be unique with a secondary index.; - You need to get the GCP service account key and store it in a secret.; - The GCP service account needs permissions on the bucket. It should be bucket writer.; - Name ""user_secrets"" seems overly specific (buckets and service accounts are not secrets). ""user_data""?; - Please don't give the database a public IP.; - From a usability perspective, for user-visible names I have to say I really dislike long uuids and like the k8s-style short random string at the end. For k8s resource, you get this for free with the `generate_name` argument. For other stuff, long-term, this will potentially require retry logic to make it robust.; - I don't like this create table logic (FYI @danking @jigold). Most database users should not have permissions to create databases. There should be a k8s secret with the database root and a secret for each specific database application that only has access to that database.

Content: Hi @pcarruscag,; thank you very much for the insight and the well thought proposed solution. I wasn't aware that there was such a loss in performance, it seems clear that something needs to be done.

I'm using this feature more and more, I was planning to extend it in the structural solver to remove the `if fsi` statements, and I also used it in the rework of the mesh solver, as defining variables at the interface only reduces greatly the memory footprint (sort of like the node-vertex structures in geometry).

ISSUE_COMMENT,Performance,1058,optimiz,optimization,"Wow! Thanks for getting on this!. Let me elaborate a little. First,. > How useful would something like this be to you? Do you think you'd keep an implementation based on this long term? Or would you end up implementing your own thing in the end anyway?. It would be *extremely* useful. It would become the default propagator for the krotov package. I would expect that with the ability to propagate single time steps with `mesolve`, optimization becomes feasible for any system that `mesolve` can propagate over the entire time grid in less than a few seconds. That would be a huge improvement over the current situation, where the lack of a good propagator limits the optimization effectively to toy problems. We *may* still try to implement in Cython some polynomial propagators (propagators that evaluate `exp[-i H dt] Ψ` or `exp[L dt] ρ` via expansion into a polynomial series - think Taylor series but faster converging, through the use of Chebychev or Newton polynomials). That work hasn't really been going anywhere lately, though. It may or may not end up being faster than `mesolve`, but it's certainly less flexible.

Content: Wow! Thanks for getting on this!. Let me elaborate a little. First,. > How useful would something like this be to you? Do you think you'd keep an implementation based on this long term? Or would you end up implementing your own thing in the end anyway?. It would be *extremely* useful. It would become the default propagator for the krotov package. I would expect that with the ability to propagate single time steps with `mesolve`, optimization becomes feasible for any system that `mesolve` can propagate over the entire time grid in less than a few seconds. That would be a huge improvement over the current situation, where the lack of a good propagator limits the optimization effectively to toy problems. We *may* still try to implement in Cython some polynomial propagators (propagators that evaluate `exp[-i H dt] Ψ` or `exp[L dt] ρ` via expansion into a polynomial series - think Taylor series but faster converging, through the use of Chebychev or Newton polynomials). That work hasn't really been going anywhere lately, though. It may or may not end up being faster than `mesolve`, but it's certainly less flexible. So even then, an mesolve that can do single steps would still be great. I would also think that being able to do time steps would be exceedingly useful to *any* gradient-based optimal control scheme. Wouldn't it greatly simplify your own GRAPE implementation?

Are you ok with silently do nothing if R__IMT is undefined? Would it be better to print a warning?. Thank you, yes, a warning would probably be better. > 3. Can we also have a way to disable RNTuple's multi-threading even if implicit MT is enabled, like TTree has?. Yes, this makes sense to me. It will probably need a big warning in the docs about when to call it and/or some graceful shutdown logic. Even if this PR doesn't make it that method might be valuable by itself. > the rationale behind my question is that we should not have N different multi-threading behaviors for N components. I completely agree, it is very nice to be able to say ""if you want multithreading, call `EnableImplicitMT` and you're done"". > and we should play well with the TBB settings of frameworks such as CMSSW, but it's not clear to me how we do that now, actually. For the RNTuple NanoAOD project, we were hoping to plug in the CMSSW tbb instance with `RPageStorage::SetTaskScheduler` (for both page sink and source): https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/a9c61d56afd70b74425779f330a4ec2cc581bb0b/tree/ntuple/v7/inc/ROOT/RPageStorage.hxx#L136. by implementing a derived `RTaskScheduler` on the CMSSW side so they have control over task isolation etc. ; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/4118c0cb6db03998ae77f56f57cc372ac

There are a bajillion reasons why file I/O can't occur.; - Compression. I don't think we compress our files at all, do we?. For the record HDF5 supports virtual files, parallel I/O through MPI, and compression. Seeing whether it meets our file needs overall is on my todo list, but if someone else wants to take a stab at it in the meantime go for it.

Clair3 has both a full-alignment network (ResNet), and a pileup network (Bi-LSTM). .

Content: > Actually, tags are one key-word annotation. Ah... makes sense. > My suggestion is to add a one-keyword metadata field. Sounds sensible, but I wonder is it possible that people will then want tags with different interpretations?. The alternative I'm thinking is to simply have a dictionary entry ; ```json; {; ""omeroTags"": ""tag1, tag2, tag3""; }; ```; but I don't know whether it's safe to use a comma (or anything else) as a delimiter. Otherwise, I guess there could be a general `tags` list in a QuPath project entry. Do you think either option is strongly preferable to the other?

Then when you have an error resulting in multiple overloads we will need to compare their source locations to order the diagnostics. This patch makes this codes to work while the llvm_unreachable makes it crash in production. > ; > * Revert change in `SourceLocation::isBeforeInTranslationUnitThan`: I believe that all locations have a `SourceManager` nowadays, even from the command line. That was probably relevant for the PCH and rootmaps?

[InstanSeg](https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg) is a new, deep learning-based method for nucleus & cell segmentation that aims to be fast, accurate & easy to use. We're working on more documentation, but for now see [the extension repository for more info](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-instanseg) & links to two preprints that explain the method - both for [brightfield](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.15954) and [multiplexed images](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.04.611150). > **Note: Other extensions (e.g. for StarDist) have not been updated for compatibility with this release candidate.**; > We plan to update them for the final release. ## What to download; * For **Windows** (two options, functionally the same); * [`QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Windows.msi`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/download/v0.6.0-rc1/QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Windows.msi) - if you want a standard Windows (local) installer; * [`QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Windows.zip`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/download/v0.6.0-rc1/QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Windows.zip) - unzip it and double-click QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1.exe (no further installation needed); * For **Mac** (two options, depending upon processor); * [`QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Mac-x64.pkg`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/download/v0.6.0-rc1/QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Mac-x64.pkg) - for Macs with Intel Processors *or* Apple Silicon (M1/M2); * [`QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Mac-arm64.pkg`](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/download/v0.6.0-rc1/QuPath-v0.6.0-rc1-Mac-arm64.pkg) - for Macs using Apple Silicon.

Precomputed databases also require less overhead RAM, since only the required parts are loaded; * `easy-search`, `easy-taxonomy`, `easy-linclust` and `easy-cluster` workflows can take an

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: This release adds two big improments:. 1. The audit log feature will now include upstream audit info from tasks that are already finished when running the workflow, by reading in their (existing) audit log files. The field names have also been made shorter and more succinct. 2. Ports now support connecting multiple upstream ports to in-ports. This makes it much easier to create components for various merge and reduce operations, among other things. Note though that it will require to go-run port.RunMergeInputs() on all input ports, which contains code that will merge from multiple inputs into the ports `InChan` channel, which can still be used to do range operations on, for simplicity. ## Full list of new commits in this release. - a584425e3387798026cecb48671d30df29f8adef Implement new feature: Allow multiple inputs in ports ; - 067df02e52a6424271b0dff8a2396346af7c511b Add ReadAuditFile() method in ip; - 5a38927672b01bd25900c4b8c2f7793ac4613b1e New feature: Read upstream audit info from existing audit log files, for files that exist; - ff94caf9c950afe39cfe1d3339671c37ceb018af Shorten method name: Port.{ConnectStrings -> ConnectStr}(); - 4433cf55b1a3e1c7967cad11b8129073b17f0863 API change: Shorter more sensible field names in audit log; - 55a193aea2c2e965c79b56a5f8136d00501630e6 Back to not create channel for new paramports, except in ConnectStrings(), to not trip up connect logic; - 0a4fb82784d0be51395c2c3f69268a8db9ffeb3a API change in task: new Param() accessor method; - 0d38b89c07d91e9935da66fe8c706a7bbce43ddd API change in task: GetInPath()->InPath(); - 3dd17bae89633ac833a96db6907ec73f54dcb673 New convenience method ParamPort.ConnectStrings() for simply sending one or more strings; - 183eab934d3f86e93789926b22cdb33085788acc Create chan in NewParamPort

The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible. (by **Boxi Li**); - **MAJOR** Improved qubit circuit simulators, including OpenQASM support and performance optimisations. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits. (by **Boxi Li**); - Refactor ``QubitCircuit.resolve_gate()`` (by

This allows using the data-driven likelihood factorization, which can improve quantification accuracy on certain classes of ""difficult"" transcripts. Currently, this feature interacts best (i.e., yields the most considerable improvements) when using alignment-based mode and when enabling error modeling `--useErrorModel`, though it can yield improvements in the mapping-based mode as well. This feature will also interact constructively with selective-alignment, which should land in the next (non-bug fix) release. * Added the `quantmerge` command. This allows producing a multi-sample TSV file with aggregated abundance metrics over samples from many different quantification runs. This can be useful to ease e.g. uploading of quantified data to certain online analysis tools like [Degust](http://degust.erc.monash.edu/). ; Other improvements, features and changes; -----. * The [multi-threaded read parser used by Salmon](https://github.com/rob-p/FQFeeder) has been updated to considerably improve CPU utilization. Specifically, the previous queue management strategy (busy waiting) has been replaced by an intelligent, bounded, exponential-backoff strategy. Many improvements (and much of the code) comes from [this series of blog posts](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/important-properties-of-spinlocks/) by David Geier. Basically, what this means is that the performance will be the same as the prior implementation if your disks can feed reads to Salmon quickly enough, but if they can't, considerably less CPU time will be wasted waiting on input (i.e. processing speed will be better matched to I/O throughput).; ; * In addition to the improved parser behavior, some of the noisy logger messages in the parser have been eliminated.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: c.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i142/3953977) has been merged into the master branch. This allows using the data-driven likelihood factorization, which can improve quantification accuracy on certain classes of ""difficult"" transcripts. Currently, this feature interacts best (i.e., yields the most considerable improvements) when using alignment-based mode and when enabling error modeling `--useErrorModel`, though it can yield improvements in the mapping-based mode as well. This feature will also interact constructively with selective-alignment, which should land in the next (non-bug fix) release. * Added the `quantmerge` command. This allows producing a multi-sample TSV file with aggregated abundance metrics over samples from many different quantification runs. This can be useful to ease e.g. uploading of quantified data to certain online analysis tools like [Degust](http://degust.erc.monash.edu/). ; Other improvements, features and changes; -----. * The [multi-threaded read parser used by Salmon](https://github.com/rob-p/FQFeeder) has been updated to considerably improve CPU utilization. Specifically, the previous queue management strategy (busy waiting) has been replaced by an intelligent, bounded, exponential-backoff strategy. Many improvements (and much of the code) comes from [this series of blog posts](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/important-properties-of-spinlocks/) by David Geier. Basically, what this means is that the performance will be the same as the prior implementation if your disks can feed reads to Salmon quickly enough, but if they can't, considerably less CPU time will be wasted waiting on input (i.e. processing speed will be better matched to I/O throughput).; ; * In addition to the improved parser behavior, some of the noisy logger messages in the parser have been eliminated. In ""pathological"" situations with very fast disks and slow CPUs (or vice-versa), the previous parser may have generated an inordinate amount of output, creati

Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: lt.native_files` field, controllable by `AtomicInput.protocols.native_files` setting (#2361). ## Performance Optimizations. - Direct SCF jobs can now use density screening and incremental Fock build (#2155).; - DIIS routines have been vectorized in preparation for their refactoring to Python (#2355). ## Details of Interest. - Linear response enabled for UHF references (#2266).; - Fix SCF memory leak and `Vector::dgemv` error. Not an correctness issue (#2347).; - MBIS charges and volume ratios separated as OEProp tasks (#2273).; - Save gradient and Hessian results from finite difference more thoroughly in QCVars (#2293).; - Add DFTensor class for better recording and manipulating density cummulant theory (DCT) (#2250).; - Fix some memory leaks or memory mangement: DFT integration coordinates (#2352), `qcdb.BasisSet` (#2349), libmints (#2346), cubeprop (#2345).; - Prepare DIIS for moving to Python (#2298, #2327, #2350, #2325). ## Bug Fixes. - The performance improvement for exchange in range-separated functionals added in #1911 in v1.4 has been found to have correctness issues discussed in #2279. An internal library call was fixed in v1.4.1 with #2283, but some runtime conditions and BLAS calls still lead to errors, so the controlling wcombine option is disabled while under investigation in #2362.; - Fix mapping for DFT functional names for BrianQC jobs (#2357).; - Allow UHF gradients to be run on systems without beta electrons (#2344).; - Fix external potential + FISAPT results when moledule specified with units Bohr (#2331).; - Fix MCSCF final energy mismatch (#2259); - Fix SCF initialization so that linear dependencies get fed properly to FNOCC (#2302).; - Make Windows conda build more broadly runnable by altering ENABLE_XHOST option (#2292).; - Fix fractional occupation with symmetry (#2280, #2290).; - Fix print spacing in FCIDUMP files for 1e and 0e (#2277).; - Fix a bug where MOM could clear all electrons (#2270).; - Fix handling of frozen core orbitals in SAPT

The options are BEFORE, AFTER, BOTH and NONE. * There is a new command-line flag `--fullLengthAlignment`, which performs selective-alignment over the full length of the read, beginning from the (approximate) initial mapping location and using extension alignment. This is in contrast with the default behavior which is to only perform alignment between the MEMs in the optimal chain (and before the first and after the last MEM if applicable). The default strategy forces the MEMs to belong to the alignment, but has the benefit that it can discover indels prior to the first hit shared between the read and reference. * The `-d/--du

Content: This release adds two big improments:. 1. The audit log feature will now include upstream audit info from tasks that are already finished when running the workflow, by reading in their (existing) audit log files. The field names have also been made shorter and more succinct. 2. Ports now support connecting multiple upstream ports to in-ports. This makes it much easier to create components for various merge and reduce operations, among other things.

We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: nd the syntax is meant to be intuitive and general. For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:; * `--read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]`. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read `2`, and it spans from the first index `1` (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the `end` of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read `1` and occupies positions `1-16`, and the UMI comes from read `1` and occupies positions `17-26`. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify `--bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23]` to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: er; and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced.; In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators``; specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have; had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to; easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know.; A notebook to help with migration is available on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18TcuHNQifYSHdGey7otK8IPDB1YbDZpW?usp=sharing). . An extensive list of changes follows. ## Contributors. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``. Other members of the QuTiP Admin team have been heavily involved in reviewing,; testing and designing QuTiP 5:. - Alexander Pitchford; - Asier Galicia; - Nathan Shammah; - Shahnawaz Ahmed; - Neill Lambert; - Simon Cross; - Paul Menczel. Two Google Summer of Code contributors updated the tutorials and benchmarks to; QuTiP 5:. - Christian Staufenbiel updated many of the [tutorials](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tutorials).; - Xavier Sproken update the [benchmarks](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-benchmark/).

Now one should call CMake directly using options and guidance in the first ~115 lines of top-level CMakeLists.txt.; * Switched Python binding of C++ from Boost Python to pybind11. Renamed Py-bound C++ library from ""psi4"" to ""core"". A consequence is that Psi4 now requires full C++11 compliance (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.3+, Apple Clang 6.1+, ICC 2016.0.2+). Note that ICC requires GCC and therefore GCC 4.9+. Note that PyBind11 adheres more to C-style than Python-style when it comes to references and pointer counting. As such, several functions required deep changes as internal references from C-side are no longer manipulatable Python-side.; * Added testing mode to see if Psi4 basically works when you turn it on. From a build directory, using CTest, `ctest -L smoke`. On any executable, using pytest, `psi4 --test`. On the python module, using pytest, `psi4.test()`.; * Reworked plugin system to CMake from GNUMake. Use `psi4 --plugin-compile` to generate Makefile rather than `psi4 --new-plugin-makefile` as formerly. Plugin interface has been substantial

It can now cluster to 1.0 sequence identity; * Improve target profile search, set max-seqs to infinite for alignments. ; * Improve speed of `align` if prefilter result fit into memory; * Many usability improvements; * Improved suggestions of bash completion; * Expert modules are hidden by default, use `-h` flag to show everything; * Speed up `mergeclusters` by a lot; * Fix sequence identity print out bug if the id is less than 10%; * MPI Runner variable can now correctly contain further parameters (RUNNER=""mpirun -np 4"" was not working); * Enforcing GCC 4.6 compatibilty in our continous integration. ## Devlopers; * MMseqs2 can now be included in framework mode to subprojects; * DBReader has a SHUFFLE mode

WIKI,Availability,1483,error,errors,"ar PCA-based integrations have been used before, for instance, in [Weinreb18]. As ingest is simple and the procedure clear, the workflow is transparent and fast.; Like BBKNN, ingest leaves the data matrix itself invariant.; Unlike BBKNN, ingest solves the label mapping problem (like scmap) and maintains an embedding that might have desired properties like specific clusters or trajectories.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: ar PCA-based integrations have been used before, for instance, in [Weinreb18]. As ingest is simple and the procedure clear, the workflow is transparent and fast.; Like BBKNN, ingest leaves the data matrix itself invariant.; Unlike BBKNN, ingest solves the label mapping problem (like scmap) and maintains an embedding that might have desired properties like specific clusters or trajectories. We refer to this asymmetric dataset integration as ingesting annotations from an annotated reference adata_ref into an adata that still lacks this annotation. It is different from learning a joint representation that integrates datasets in a symmetric way as BBKNN, Scanorma, Conos, CCA (e.g. in Seurat) or a conditional VAE (e.g. in scVI, trVAE) would do, but comparable to the initiall MNN implementation in scran.
