Content: In the 6.30 dev cycle, I made a mistake when refactoring the HistFactory code in 3c68044c257:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/3c68044c257e9ee7207e23e7cceb69d7eda596e9#diff-42ea09980f1ed2bacde4381f212c35d78be6ddedccf746953dc99d6455525d8aL1801-L1804. The robust way to skip overflow bins in 2D and 3D was replaced with something that only worked in 1D. Thanks to Veronica for reporting this on the ROOT forum!. https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/discrepancy-in-2d-histfactory-fit-results-between-root-versions-6-28-06-vs-nightlies-with-beeston-barlow-method-activated. I validated now that the fit results with the reproducer on the forum are the same with 6.28 and 6.30. To be backported to the 6.30 branch.

",False,"The provided content is a series of CMake error messages indicating that the system can't find hadd.exe, which suggests that the build configuration is failing. This relates to the availability aspect in the sense that if the build fails, the system won't function as intended, implying potential issues with configuration or dependencies. However, this specific scenario doesn't directly reflect on the readiness of the system itself but rather on the build process. Therefore, it's more aligned with the build and configuration quality attribute rather than availability."

",True,"The content 'Make tests fail if ASan finds an errors' seems to refer to making tests fail when some error is detected by AddressSanitizer (ASan). This relates to software reliability and testing for potential issues, which are aspects of availability as it pertains to the system's readiness and minimizing downtime. However, the connection is somewhat tangential because ASan primarily focuses on memory safety rather than general system availability. Additionally, making tests fail upon detecting errors is a standard practice in software development for ensuring code reliability, which does tie into the broader concept of availability by addressing potential failures before they impact users.
