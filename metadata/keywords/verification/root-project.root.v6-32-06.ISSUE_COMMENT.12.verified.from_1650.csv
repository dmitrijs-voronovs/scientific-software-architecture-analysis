I think using TArayD is an improvement than using double pointers, but I don't see any reason why not using a more standard std::vector. ; I understand also for the interface your preference for an API similar to the current TGraphAsymmError. Thank you for explaining the meaning of SetDimensionEY, I think the name is not super clear, I would maybe just call it SetEY. ; One comment on the passed array, I think the pointers should be passed as cont , since they will not be modified. . One other comment I have , I will not have a method to Set the error dimension. I think it will be better instead a AddError method that will increment by one the dimension and add all the point errors. This I think it will be more useful

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing quality attributes in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to distinguish sentences that clearly relate to a given quality attribute from those that do not. 

Evaluate whether the content accurately aligns with its associated quality attribute, given the context provided. Your goal is to determine if the content makes sense in relation to the quality attribute description or if it is a false positive.

Data:

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: Sorry, there is too much noise in the CI results. What is the actual error with this PR?

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content refers to CI results and an error with a PR (pull request). This relates to the build process and potential issues that could affect availability if not addressed. While it doesn't directly discuss system readiness or failure handling, it's indirectly connected to the quality attribute by mentioning issues that might impact reliability or recovery."
