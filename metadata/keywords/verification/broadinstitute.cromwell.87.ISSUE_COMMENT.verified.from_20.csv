Quality Attribute: Safety
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: I also played around with bolting on the docker hashing too. To be clear, I like @mcovarr's PR here better, as it's much cleaner, and has tests! Still, here's some overlapping [code](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/compare/job_avoidance...ks_hash_docker_image) to look at, especially the first commit with an alternative way to get an `ActorSystem` down into the `BackendCall`. A few issues left though, but some/most of these can be logged as new tickets, and we can get basic wiring in for the moment via this PR. Biggest issue-- 10 seconds is right on the edge for testing _and_ checking the docker server for the hash, so different docker tests currently timeout intermittently. Among other issues I saw, `Future` exception handling may be different due to refactoring. For example converting `Future { /* big block */ }` to `/* big block */ hashFuture.map(hash => ...)` allows exceptions within the block to not get caught (as expected?). Also I wasn't sure yet how we want to handle some `Failure` cases, specifically when the docker server doesn't return a hash. I assume that means that we should just run again from scratch, and NOT go to a `FailedExecution` state in the database. Or maybe we should go to `Failure`, and just retry a particular operations later. With ~~Gatling~~ Tyburn load testing, perhaps we can log any docker client errors now, and start to distinguish them with custom error handling code as they pop up.

Deployability,rolling,rolling,"@horneth - so I see 2 Futures in here. One the little bit changing the state (around the Props) and the other was resolveAndEvaluate. As background for my statement I'll say the following:; - We've already seen firsthand the havoc which can erupt from having Futures rolling around inside an Actor. They break the Actor Model's abstraction that the internals of an actor are single threaded, meaning you now have to reason about shared mutable state, etc. We _can_ do that, but there are easier paths than actors to deal with that. We've been better about this recently but my concern is that it's too easy for stuff like that to sneak into what were previously pure Futures. Mixing Futures & Actors is not really a great idea.; - There are two async operations in the actor, which means that it is certainly doing two different things (I'll admit that the creation of an actor is a fairly lame 'thing'), disrupting Akka's mantra that actors should do one thing only. What I was suggesting was that the work being performed by these Futures be themselves pushed to their own actors. When they complete they can message back to this one, and those messages could be use to manage state transitions and such. (and to be clear, this is _not_ our little 'tol' code phrase - it's something I think we need to be much better about as we refactor cromwell)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/818#issuecomment-218573678,"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

As background for my statement I'll say the following:; - We've already seen firsthand the havoc which can erupt from having Futures rolling around inside an Actor. They break the Actor Model's abstraction that the internals of an actor are single threaded, meaning you now have to reason about shared mutable state, etc. We _can_ do that, but there are easier paths than actors to deal with that. We've been better about this recently but my concern is that it's too easy for stuff like that to sneak into what were previously pure Futures. Mixing Futures & Actors is not really a great idea.; - There are two async operations in the actor, which means that it is certainly doing two different things (I'll admit that the creation of an actor is a fairly lame 'thing'), disrupting Akka's mantra that actors should do one thing only. What I was suggesting was that the work being performed by these Futures be themselves pushed to their own actors. When they complete they can message back to this one, and those messages could be use to manage state transitions and such.

Content: Had a brief chat w/ @dshiga - I was wondering if all slowness was directly tied to reading from metadata or general slowness and it was the latter (not that it couldn't be _caused_ by reading from MD, but it's across the board slowness). Three thoughts:; - We were talking yesterday about how someone not named me should try setting up typesafe monitor and use it to debug/profile/analyze.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Thinking about this a little more, I just added this comment to Kate's doc:; ""FWIW, I don’t necessarily need Cromwell to do the delete for me in my use case. I’m happy to do it if I have all the files at hand that I want to delete. This is important because I don’t really want an all-or-nothing delete. I usually want to delete the call cached intermediate results, but not the final outputs of the workflow (and I note that not all pipeline developers list the outputs in the wdl -- I just learned this yesterday from Megan -- so I would like some control over the delete in many cases).""

Content: Yeah, it's definitely easier to get rolling. I found pretty quickly in Centaur that I was rolling my own extensions to Ficus (typeclasses IIRC?) which seemed to defeat the point. I switched to configs as it gives you more stuff out of the box. The monad returns I've both enjoyed and shaken my fist at depending on the situation. I liked these two better than any of the rest I saw. . I didn't look at the PR but if you didn't need to do any extensions I suppose it doesn't matter for now. . Edit: To be clear, ""I suppose it doesn't matter"" means ""carry on"", ficus was definitely easier to use until I found myself making custom typeclasses and wondering if i should stick them in Lenthall.

Content: >The issue is that she's asking to have everything dumped into one location. In many workflows I have a task like this:; ```. task copy {; Array[File] files; String destination. command {; mkdir -p ${destination}; cp -L -R -u ${sep=' ' files} ${destination}; }. output {; Array[File] out = files; }; }; ```; And I apply this task to all final outputs of my workflows because my colleagues do not want to go into super-nested folder structure with many debugging files (like logs and so on), they just want to get the final results! Having a flat-copy feature will save me from copy-pasting this task everywhere =) . Regarding overwrite risks, I think they are exaggerated:; 1) Usually, it takes you multiple runs until you get everything working, however, after that you switch to another dataset and point other members of the team to the folder they should go to pick the results from you. As I understand the copying of the workflow output happens only when the workflow succeeded.; 2) The final output folder is assigned in the options. That means that for another run you can simply change it.; 3) It is possible to put rewriting only if last file is newer than previous.

In this case, I assumed that a restart of a service after an exception was probably OK, but it was associated with ""dead"" jobs that now appear to have been on the google side of things and not with Cromwell directly. I'll follow up with whatever else I can learn.

Availability,down,down," (via its API). but for now, without a clean API for services, only the first two really make sense. Singularity is not special. It's just a binary. ## Why has it been so confusing?. We get Singularity confused with Docker, because they are both containers. Same thing right? Sort of, but not exactly. Docker is a container technology, but actually it's older and has had time to develop a full API for services. It meets the criteria for both a backend and an executable, and this is because it can be conceptualized as both ""a thing that you run"" and ""the thing that is the container you run in.""

This comes down to OCI compliance, and having a way for some host to manage all of its Singularity containers. Right now we just have start and stop, but we can't connect containers, define ports, or even easily get a PID. It could (sort of?) be hacked, but we would be better off waiting for that nice standard. ## Reproducible Binary (Workflow Step) vs. Environment. There is also a distinction that I haven't completely wrapped my head around. Docker is very commonly used as an environment - you put a bunch of software (e.g., samtools, bwa aligner, etc.) and then issue commands to the container with custom things. Singularity, in my mind, to be truly a reproducible thing is more of the workflow step or script. It will have the software inside, but better should have those same commands represented with internal modularity.

Availability,robust,robust,"@geoffjentry asked me to clarify, so here I am!. Currently, PAPI doesn't understand FOFN... so they are really just a File that contains strings. Often they are created by taking the file output of a scatter call as an array and writing it to an array like. ```; Array[File] vcfs = PreviousTask.output ...; File fofn = write_lines(vcfs); ```. Then that FOFN is used as the parameter to the task, and used by the tool in the command directly. The only thing that gets localized by PAPI is the FOFN itself. Keep in mind right now that the only scenario where this works is where your docker has access to the file, which on Google means when you're running in service account mode, but hopefully we can overcome that in the future. Just for context, my use case here is more like 'resume' than call caching. I don't expect to find results from some previous/other run of the pipeline. It's really that something broke, I tweaked the WDL, and now want to basically pick up where I left off. That's the specific problem I have (and any methods developer will have with a FOFN step). There are two ways I can think of going about this:. 1. Fix call caching to handle FOFNs specifically. This is tricky I think, but is most robust. In this case, I want Cromwell to understand a File of File references as a specific type but just for call caching purposes. 2. Change call caching to re-use files rather than copying, thus the path of the file doesn't changes, the FOFN doesn't change, and the call cache hits. This is how I ended up working around this by splitting the WDL into pieces where I supply the inputs to avoid the cache-miss step. I believe we have this option in the SFS?.

Testability,test,test,"Hi @geoffjentry - thanks for the prompt and detailed response. It makes sense to submit using curl instead. That might save most of the 2.5 seconds. But since your fast-polling hello world test still took 7 seconds from pickup to completion, I still think this would be frustratingly slow. I'm familiar with Snakemake (and about two dozen other similar tools to be found scattered across the web) but I think WDL is better in a number of ways. The main points that I like are (1) that the workflow language is clearly separated from the execution engine, (2) that the language is much more human-readable than CWL, and (3) the possibility to serialize/deserialize values, e.g., so that (3a) simple operations, e.g., concatenation of different results can be done in the workflow language and (3b) one can do things like mapping a task over a set of values coming out of another task. It is also nice that (4) there is a rather solid set of backing organizations behind WDL and Cromwell. As far as I know, this combination of properties gives WDL a rather unique value proposition. Maybe there is room for a simpler local-only WDL execution engine focused on speed and rapid iteration. That could be used for development and then the execution of production workflows on various cloud backends etc could still be done by Cromwell. I was dabbling one weekend a few months ago with a local-only Python compiler/execution engine for WDL.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: When you make a call from an imported WDL, the call is automatically aliased to the simple task name, so in your case:. ```wdl; import ""a.wdl"" as a. workflow b {. # This task is 'a.t', but the callis given the alias 't'; call a.t {}. String x = t.s; }; ```. Similarly, this should be an error:; ```wdl; import ""a.wdl"" as a; import ""z.wdl"" as z. workflow b {. # Cannot do this because the calls would have the same alias:; call a.t {}; call z.t {}. # Which t?; String x = t.s; }; ```

1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
