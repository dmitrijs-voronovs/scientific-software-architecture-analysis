",False,"The content provided appears to be a script snippet related to installing CUDA and other software dependencies. It includes error messages about importing 'soft_unicode' from 'markupsafe', which suggests it's part of some build or installation process. The lines mention pip3 install, curl commands, and apt-get operations. While the primary focus seems to be on dependency management and system setup, there is no direct indication that this relates to availability in terms of system readiness or fault tolerance. Therefore, it does not align with the quality attribute of Availability."

",False,"The content provided is primarily log entries indicating stages of installation and dependency conflicts related to protocol buffers (protobuf). It mentions incompatibility issues between installed packages like google-api-core and protobuf version 3.13.0, which conflicts with the required versions. This indicates potential issues during dependency resolution or installation, affecting the system's ability to function as expected. The context refers to availability, focusing on reliability and recovery from failures. However, the content discussed does not directly relate to the readiness of the system when required but instead details specific installation errors and version conflicts that may impact availability indirectly. There is no clear indication that the system is actively being made available or operational, nor are there measures taken for fault masking or repair as described in the attribute's focus on reliability and recovery. Instead, it highlights installation issues which could be a factor but not directly tied to the system being ready for use.

",True,"The content provided is an email exchange discussing the training and usage of a DeepVariant model.

This aligns with the concept of Availability in software engineering as it ensures that the system can perform its functions when required."
Availability," for DeepVariant than the provided VCF files (but there are going to be considerably fewer indels for the overall counts). Going back to _point 4_, running DeepVariant with both my provided .bam alignment (after combining the per-chromosome alignments) and BWA-MEM re-aligned reads both resulted in a set of ~7 million reads (which is closer to the total number reported in that other study for DeepVariant). However, if you emphasize precision, perhaps that somewhat matches my filtered set (in terms of the SNP counts and more noticeable indel differences for homozygous/heterozygous recovery).

Content:  for DeepVariant than the provided VCF files (but there are going to be considerably fewer indels for the overall counts). Going back to _point 4_, running DeepVariant with both my provided .bam alignment (after combining the per-chromosome alignments) and BWA-MEM re-aligned reads both resulted in a set of ~7 million reads (which is closer to the total number reported in that other study for DeepVariant). However, if you emphasize precision, perhaps that somewhat matches my filtered set (in terms of the SNP counts and more noticeable indel differences for homozygous/heterozygous recovery).

Some other lines of evidence DeepVariant might use for that is the higher coverage (1200 is a coverage that would often be seen in duplicated parts of the genome) and the unusual allele frequency ratio (70% Ref, 30% Alt).

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.

While there's a connection, the focus is more on installation and dependency resolution rather than the overall readiness of the system to perform its functions reliably. Therefore, this content partially aligns with the Availability quality attribute but lacks direct evidence of recovery or fault handling, making it more of a partial true positive."

",False,"The provided content appears to be log messages from a software tool. The presence of terms like 'W' for warnings and 'I0120' for information indicates that the system is generating these logs as part of its operation. These logs typically do not directly relate to availability but rather to the functional aspects of the system, such as data processing or configuration issues. Therefore, while the logs indicate something is wrong (unrecognized SAM header type), they don't directly speak to the readiness of the system to perform its function. The mention of generating a BAM file again might suggest that there's an issue with data generation, which could affect availability if the data is incomplete or incorrect. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this specific log content aligns with the Availability quality attribute. Given the primary focus of Availability on system readiness and reliability, the connection here seems tenuous. Thus, I would categorize this as a false positive for Availability."

",False,"The provided content appears to be a log snippet from a build process, specifically related to Bazel and Go configuration errors.

The attribute of Availability focuses on the system's readiness and reliability. While this error is about configuration, it doesn't directly relate to availability in terms of the system being ready when required. However, the content does involve a failure during build which can impact overall availability by delaying or preventing successful builds. Thus, while not directly describing availability, it does touch on aspects that could affect it indirectly.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content provided appears to be a stack trace or error log from a script execution. The presence of commands like 'gcsfuse' and references to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources ('gs://canis/CNR-data/...') suggests this is related to data processing in the cloud. The error mentions an exit status 1, indicating a failure in executing a pipeline step. However, the attribute description for Availability focuses on system readiness, fault masking, and recovery rather than specific script execution errors or command outputs. Therefore, this content does not reflect the quality attribute of Availability but rather represents an operational log or error message from a software run. Hence, it is not directly related to Availability."

Content: > Hello,; > ; > I'm very new to model training and honestly, coding, so thank you for your patience! I'm trying to run my own samples following along with the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md). I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script.; > ; > I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated.; > ; > Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. Let me reply to this part first:; ""First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the docum

If you're planning to train, the files you passed to `truth_variants` needs to have `GT` field (providing as true labels to the training examples). I'm not sure if this is the reason why you're having the errors you have. But either way, the variants.vcf.gz file you're providing here won't be the right input for `--truth_variants`. @pichuan Thank you for pointing that out, I am not so familiar with bioinformatics so I don't really know how to continue from here.; Where can I find the right input for `--truth_variants` for my reference?

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content provided in this context discusses issues related to correct file usage for training purposes, specifically about the `truth_variants` parameter and input files like `variants.vcf.gz`. This relates to ensuring that the system inputs are correctly formatted, which ties into availability as it pertains to the readiness of the system to function properly. However, the connection is indirect; the issue here is more about correct usage rather than system reliability or recovery. The content does not directly address fault masking, recovery mechanisms, or minimizing downtime, but instead focuses on input parameters and file usage. Therefore, while there is a tangential connection to availability through system readiness, the primary concern here is about technical input parameters, making it more of an indirect or minimal association with the quality attribute."

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: @Npaffen BAI and PBI have similar concepts, but different approaches. BAI is an R-tree approach, while PBI seems to be HDF5-like -- basically different formats. Regarding the error you see is because your BAM and reference don't match in their sequence contig names. For instance, the reference sequence has the chromosome naming convention of `chr1`, `chr2`, etc., but in the error I see `1` as a name to match against. So if you type the following command for you BAM file:. ```; samtools view -H GFX.bam | grep @SQ; ```. You should see something like this for the same naming convention for the `SN` field:. ```; @SQ SN:chr1 LN:249250621; @SQ SN:chr2 LN:243199373; @SQ SN:chr3 LN:198022430; @SQ SN:chr4 LN:191154276; @SQ SN:chr5 LN:180915260; @SQ SN:chr6 LN:171115067; @SQ SN:chr7 LN:159138663; @SQ SN:chr8 LN:146364022; ```. Also I'm assuming you used the same reference you aligned your reads against when generating your BAM files, as the reference used for DeepVariant.; ; Let me know if there is something I should expand on.

Content: CUDA 8.0, cudnn 6, and tensorflow-gpu 1.4. I ran the WES example. That went fine. Questions: what is the minimum allele frequency deepvariant will call? Is there a version contemplated that will do matched tumor/normal pairs? Unmatched pairs (as with a “pooled” normal)?. Thanks,; Brad Thomas. From: Ryan Poplin [mailto:notifications@github.com]; Sent: Monday, February 5, 2018 5:10 PM; To: google/deepvariant <deepvariant@noreply.github.com>; Cc: Brad Thomas <brad.thomas@neogenomics.com>; Author <author@noreply.github.com>; Subject: [External]Re: [google/deepvariant] Build and test works, binaries do not (#47). Unfortunately DeepVariant isn't yet compatible with TensorFlow version 1.5 so I think you'll need to install tensorflow-gpu version 1.4 for this to work.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: Further to this question, I am trying to run 2 chromosome for the whole genome case study. . The user guide said that we can do ```--regions "" chr20 chr21"" ``` to run both chromosome, however, I get the following error when I run the make sample with ``` --regions ""chr20 chr21"" ```. I have also tried ```--regions ""20 21""```, but none of these works. . ```; E0814 18:04:05.051175 140174423590656 errors.py:64] Command line parsing failure: make_examples does not accept positional arguments but some are present on the command line: ""['/tmp/Bazel.runfiles_D92FlN/runfiles/com_google_deepvariant/deepvariant/make_examples.py', '21']"".; parallel: This job failed:; python /HD_disk/real-case-study-chr/input/bin/make_examples.zip --mode calling --ref /HD_disk/real-case-study-chr/input/data/hs37d5.fa.gz --reads /HD_disk/real-case-study-chr/input/data/HG002_NIST_150bp_50x.bam --examples /HD_disk/real-case-study-chr/output_1_2_3/HG002.examples.tfrecord@8.gz --regions 20 21 --gvcf /HD_disk/real-case-study-chr/output_1_2_3/HG002.gvcf.tfrecord@8.gz --task 2; ```.

",True,"The content discusses issues related to GPU usage and CUDA errors encountered during a DeepVariant pipeline run. It mentions specific command-line arguments affecting performance and intermediate outputs. The context includes error messages about CUDA initialization and value errors in postprocessing steps. These logs are relevant to the Availability quality attribute because they highlight issues impacting the system's readiness (reliability) when performing required functions, such as GPU resource allocation and variant processing.

From: Ryan Poplin [mailto:notifications@github.com]; Sent: Monday, February 5, 2018 3:08 PM; To: google/deepvariant <deepvariant@noreply.github.com>; Cc: Brad Thomas <brad.thomas@neogenomics.com>; Author <author@noreply.github.com>; Subject: [External]Re: [google/deepvariant] Build and test works, binaries do not (#47). I wonder if there is an issue somehow with how you are building with tensorflow-gpu. What commands did you use to build it? We think this should work with tensorflow-gpu==1.4. Here is what I did to try it out:. git clone https://github.com/google/deepvariant.git. #edit settings.sh so that DV_GPU_BUILD=1 and DV_INSTALL_GPU_DRIVERS=1. ./build-prereq.sh; ./build_release_binaries.sh. then ran a test command with the quickstart testdata:. python deepvariant/bazel-bin/deepvariant/make_examples.zip; --mode calling; --ref ""${REF}""; --reads ""${BAM}""; --regions ""chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000""; --examples ""${OUTPUT_DIR}/examples.tfrecord.gz"". which executes as expected. —; You are receiving this because you authored the thread.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/47#issuecomment-363221616>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AifcqV3UwUysMDiEktsAe-3kindiR3myks5tR22hgaJpZM4R5yAT>.

Availability,"Hi @ASLeonard . This is an interesting question. The ability to sort reads and label them with a phasing tag (specifically HP) is general to DeepVariant (meaning that on the code level it is straightforward to add to DeepVariant). This feature is only used for long reads. We performed experiments in non-trio phasing of short reads, but found there is not enough information for local phasing to add information. . Trio phasing can be much more informative for short reads over long ranges. The main obstacle is that we do not have pre-trained models which have learned how to use this information as we have for long reads. It would, in theory, be possible to train models for this (though it would be a reasonable amount of work). One of the obstacles for us to do this is that we don't know what to recommend as the best practices for the trio binning process. . I don't think that variant calling on an assembly is necessarily a good idea, because the assembly itself will have errors, and the expected distribution of REF, HET, and HOM calls will be quite different from the typical variant calling problem. Assemblies are usually less complete than the reference, especially with short read data, and this is likely to create a lot of mapping artifacts. .

To a limited extent it might be possible to supplement training, but I'm fairly pessimistic on the approach. . For the skepticism component, one of the things we try to work on is investigating explainability - cases where the ML model has learned something that might not have been immediately obvious to a human. Hopefully we'll have some things to share there soon.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content discusses skepticism in using simulated data for training and mentions investigate explainability to improve model transparency. However, it does not directly relate to Availability, which focuses on system readiness and reliability through fault masking or repair. The mention of 'availability' might be referring to the accessibility of data for training rather than system availability. Therefore, this is a false positive."

Availability,"Hi @Axze-rgb,. So we know that this organism replicates through clonal inheritance to transfer of mutations to daughter cells that would be driven by genetic drift or selection forces, and usually not by lineages. Though you say you noticed genetic clusters forming stemming from the ancestor population. So if the mutations are more localized and are still diploid, that means it would not behave in the way true germline diploid genomes would transfer their genotypes. This means you would have more alterations -- that might be real, or stem from sub-populations of clonal events affecting your sample purity -- and thus you cannot rely on ploidy to support your allele frequency (as illustrated by your plot above). This is of course assuming artifacts of sequencer errors, and others are removed. So instead you would need to do something like ""panel of clonals"" to compare against, to compare between clonal events. Then among these you would denoise for the common variants, so you can construct a phylogenetic analysis how the mutations evolve. All these alterations you would need to validate through your reads supported by multiple replicates. Though you are fighting your clonal events here, and would need to validate that the coverage of the labeled events (samples) in your cohort study are individually relatively consistent in the specific variant distribution (i.e. you want no/minimal heterogeneity of samples contaminating each individual labeled sample).

Availability,"Hi @Fred-07,. As @akolesnikov mentions, the reason that the reads are re-aligned in this way has to do with some fundamental aspects of how alignment penalties work. The alignment method, Smith Waterman, has alignment score penalties for gap open and gap extend. These penalties make the alignments you see as scoring higher than ones that open and extend a gap early in the repeat. Those alignment penalties are determined from looking at mismatch, insertion, and deletion rates across large amounts of homologous sequences. They work very well for high sequence complexity regions which have standard types of DNA replication error. In this highly repetitive context, the ways that sequence (specifically repeats) can be extended or deleted is a bit different. It might, in theory, be possible to derive better gap extend scores for regions like this, but this is both very hard and a more fundamental problem. I don't think this case is one we can easily solve without very extensive work. . I hope that the @akolesnikov suggestion of turning off realigner in regions of interest will be satisfactory.

Availability,"Hi @Npaffen . Yes, in phase variants, the reads are assigned a haplotag value. Briefly, in this process, a set of potential variants are scored with heuristics (no neural network) on the likelihood that they are heterozygous variants. A cluster of such variants forms a candidate seed for a haplotype. The evidence from multiple reads across multiple positions are used to identify the putative variants on that haplotype, and then reads are scored based on whether they fall into one of the haplotypes, the other, or cannot be phased. Because this haplotagging uses information from much longer stretches and more candidate variants than the individual process of variant calling, it has the advantage of a broader set of information. This haplotagging is used to populate the information in the ""haplotype channel"" which is one of the inputs for DeepVariant long read data. We [wrote a blog](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2021-02-08-the-haplotype-channel/) describing this channel and its impact. Note that this process is only used to provide the information to the neural network for consider, the neural network will be able to learn when this channel is or is not reliable based on genome context, coverage, etc... the network's call on the genotype is what finally goes into a variant. As a result, haplotag is not used as input to generate the non-ref blocks of the gVCF, and as the final variants called are still from the neural network, the definition of a variant remains the same - a position with an ALT allele that receives a non-reference (0/0 or ./.) call. We are currently working on a deeper description of the phasing logic used in DeepVariant, which may help understand or reproduce the haplotag method more easily.

Because this haplotagging uses information from much longer stretches and more candidate variants than the individual process of variant calling, it has the advantage of a broader set of information. This haplotagging is used to populate the information in the ""haplotype channel"" which is one of the inputs for DeepVariant long read data. We [wrote a blog](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2021-02-08-the-haplotype-channel/) describing this channel and its impact. Note that this process is only used to provide the information to the neural network for consider, the neural network will be able to learn when this channel is or is not reliable based on genome context, coverage, etc... the network's call on the genotype is what finally goes into a variant. As a result, haplotag is not used as input to generate the non-ref blocks of the gVCF, and as the final variants called are still from the neural network, the definition of a variant remains the same - a position with an ALT allele that receives a non-reference (0/0 or ./.) call. We are currently working on a deeper description of the phasing logic used in DeepVariant, which may help understand or reproduce the haplotag method more easily. Please let me know if anything in the explanation is unclear or can be elaborated further.

Content: Hi @WeiweiBian ,; first of all, the ""The index file is older than the data file"" warning is usually something to do with your input data files (BAM, VCF, or FASTA). It's usually just a warning and wouldn't affect the run. You should still be able to run the training. Looking at your error, it seems to me that you might not using the correct REF file that has the `chr` prefix. On my side, I will check to confirm that our training case study actually works as intended. But, specifically for your use case --; To re-iterate what @MariaNattestad has mentioned, the current DeepVariant setup is not designed for your use case, and our team won't really have the bandwidth to support a very different use case like yours right now. Please consider using another tool that is designed for your use case. If you plan to use TensorFlow (which is what we built on) for your own use case and explore the possibilities, that is great! Based on my experience, training with just CPUs would really slow for the training step (model_train and model_eval steps), I have not even attempted that myself to a real training run using only CPUs. I do not recommend it. I will close this issue given that your use case is not a feature that our team will have bandwidth to support officially. Thanks!

",False,"The content provided by WeiweiBian discusses an issue with their data files (BAM, VCF, FASTA) and suggests that the index file might be older than the data file. This could potentially affect the running of their analysis. However, it's noted that this is usually just a warning and shouldn't impact the overall run. The main point is about ensuring that the correct reference files (with `chr` prefix) are being used for training. Additionally, there is mention of not having enough bandwidth to support their use case as DeepVariant isn't designed for it, suggesting that the system might need further configuration or alternative tools. However, this does not directly speak to 'availability' in terms of system readiness, reliability, or recovery. The focus here is more on functional issues with input data and tool suitability rather than the system's ability to be available when required."

Availability,"Hi @aderzelle . Thank you, this is a good question. We have observed this phenomenon as well. The answer is somewhat complicated. . DeepVariant seems to have learned something about the concept of segmental duplication, where positions that appear to be variants are actually due to mismapping of similar regions which may (or may not) be captured in the reference genome. The way this manifests in a genome pileup is as one phased haplotype that is mostly reference and (one or more) phased haplotype that is variant-dense. The signal for this is further enhanced when the VAF is closer to 0.33 or 0.25 (more directly suggesting copy number 3 or 4), but it can also occur close to 0.5 (which can still indicate a copy number of 4). These regions can be variants in thee diploid genome that are incorrectly called as REF, or they could be markers of a copy number variant. In human genomes, this can suggest a user look into that region for either known copy number variants or coverage differences. One question to ask - are these regions at generally higher coverage than you would expect? . In certain variant-dense species, we have observed this phenomenon to complicate calling [in this blog we investigate this for mosquito genomes](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2018-12-05-improved-non-human-variant-calling-using-species-specific-deepvariant-models/). In this blog, we show the ability to re-train for a variant-dense species using a pedigree. If you have a pedigree available, we could also explore this with you.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: Hi @aderzelle . Thank you, this is a good question. We have observed this phenomenon as well. The answer is somewhat complicated. . DeepVariant seems to have learned something about the concept of segmental duplication, where positions that appear to be variants are actually due to mismapping of similar regions which may (or may not) be captured in the reference genome. The way this manifests in a genome pileup is as one phased haplotype that is mostly reference and (one or more) phased haplotype that is variant-dense. The signal for this is further enhanced when the VAF is closer to 0.33 or 0.25 (more directly suggesting copy number 3 or 4), but it can also occur close to 0.5 (which can still indicate a copy number of 4). These regions can be variants in thee diploid genome that are incorrectly called as REF, or they could be markers of a copy number variant. In human genomes, this can suggest a user look into that region for either known copy number variants or coverage differences. One question to ask - are these regions at generally higher coverage than you would expect? . In certain variant-dense species, we have observed this phenomenon to complicate calling [in this blog we investigate this for mosquito genomes](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2018-12-05-improved-non-human-variant-calling-using-species-specific-deepvariant-models/). In this blog, we show the ability to re-train for a variant-dense species using a pedigree. If you have a pedigree available, we could also explore this with you. We are working on ways that will allow DeepVariant to more explicitly indicate when it thinks this is the case, and to provide more information (e.g. average coverage in the sample) to DeepVariant that will allow it to better separate variants from makers of segmental duplication.

",False,"The provided content discusses issues related to variant calling in genomic data, particularly around segmental duplications and their impact on variant detection. This involves understanding the system's ability to correctly identify variants versus artifacts, which is directly tied to reliability and accuracy in processing genetic data. The concept of availability isn't explicitly mentioned, but this could relate to ensuring that the system can handle and process complex genomic datasets without failure. However, the focus here is more on the technical aspects of variant detection rather than system readiness or fault tolerance."
Availability,"Hi @aderzelle . Today we released DeepVariant v0.9, which contains several changes to code and training models. As part of this release, we have introduced changes which fix the issue for the BAM snippets presented, and which we think will generally fix the issue that you observed in other cases. To briefly summarize what we believe to be the cause - in candidate generation, a de Bruijn graph of variant and reference haplotypes is constructed. In rare cases, some graph paths are created in which local connections are valid, but no individual read supports the entire path. In your case, this caused two similar representations to generate candidates at different positions, each of which could be locally supported. In our fix, we require at least some support for the constructed graph of the candidate haplotype. We also noticed a separate fix that resolves your case. Specifically, your case was sensitive to the kmer length used to construct the graph. By default, this is 10, but we noticed that increasing to 15 also resolved your issue. We think this may reflect local repetitiveness. We have exposed this parameter in make_examples as: --dbg_min_k. This is available when running make_examples directly, but not in the Docker image. Since the issue should be resolved in v0.9 without this change, this is mostly for your information if you want to experiment with other tweaks. We would be interested to hear your feedback confirming this case is resolved in v0.9.

Availability,"Hi @aderzelle, in the case of position 10764356, the allele fraction is a bit lower in the case of the RefCall.

In the case of high coverage regions, the observed allele fraction can change as a result of this downsampling. Sampling for a particular sample is deterministic, but may happen differently across samples. Another source of difference between the three samples might be caused the realigner. DeepVariant runs a realignment that can be turned off by adding the flag `--norealign_reads` to the `make_examples` step. Turning the realigner off entirely will likely hurt overall accuracy, but for this example, it might be useful to see if that's affecting the results. Regions with many nearby variants do end up being challenging for the neural network to correctly classify. However, in the case of position 9780248, it is surprising that a candidate was not generated.

Content: Hi @crazysummerW ,. Looking at your error, it seems like this might be relevant:. ```; File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/h5py/_hl/files.py"", line 241, in make_fid; fid = h5f.create(name, h5f.ACC_TRUNC, fapl=fapl, fcpl=fcpl); File ""h5py/_objects.pyx"", line 54, in h5py._objects.with_phil.wrapper; File ""h5py/_objects.pyx"", line 55, in h5py._objects.with_phil.wrapper; File ""h5py/h5f.pyx"", line 122, in h5py.h5f.create; OSError: [Errno 5] Unable to synchronously create file (unable to lock file, errno = 5, error message = 'Input/output error'); ```. This is because this logic in our code writes a temp file:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/deepvariant/keras_modeling.py#L97-L99. ```; tmp_weights_dir = tempfile.gettempdir(); tmp_weights_path = os.path.join(tmp_weights_dir, 'tmp_weights.h5'); model.save_weights(tmp_weights_path); ```. Can you check your setting, and see if somehow your run wasn't able to create a temp file?. I reran our set up in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/docs/deepvariant-complete-t7-case-study.md (using a GCP machine as an example) and wasn't able to reproduce that error. So, it'll be very helpful for me to understand your machine setup, and try to make our code more robust in the future. Thank you!

Content: Hi @desmodus1984 ,. Fundamentally, training a DeepVariant requires truth data (truth variants and confident regions).; The core question here is: **Would you be able to get truth data for the bats you're studying**?. I quickly looked through your recent discussion with @kishwarshafin .; I believe @kishwarshafin has been trying to give you some tips on ways to construct truth. Note that this is an advanced topic. We don't expect most of our users to train DeepVariant models, or to construct truth data. However, if you do have truth data (truth variants and confident regions), you should be able to follow the documentation https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md to try to train a model. From your description above, I still think the best way to proceed is to directly use DeepVariant release models. Once you have the callsets, try to evaluate the calls first. Even if you plan to train a model, it'll be good to have those baseline metrics available, so you know whether your trained model is working or not. Does this help? If I'm misunderstanding your question, let me know.

Availability,"Hi @dhwani2410 . Is there any chance that this is from a sample for which publicly available data is present (e.g. HG001). I could look at pileups in the region for a more informed opinion. To your question about different variants - DeepVariant classifies event on a position-by-position basis, so the classifier does not have information about what output it gave at nearby variants. This can cause you to know a bit more than the classifier when looking at its full output. But it explains why the classifier can have a different result when two variants are putatively phased. One phenomenon that we observe with DeepVariant is that it often calls positions with substantial support as reference when they are nearby to other variants. This seems to be related to regions of segmental duplication, where the apparent variants come from reads that are mismapped to the region. We have a poster which documents this effect: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERe2bSyWsAcE00h?format=jpg&name=4096x4096. So DeepVariant seems to learn something of the signature of segmental duplication and is likely not calling these positions as variant for this reason.

Availability,"Hi @elcortegano . Thank you for the file, it's very informative, and I have a few observations that might help. First, all of the reads in this file which have sequence bases do have the correct number of quality values. The reads are not malformatted.

Not all mappers report secondary alignments, and this is often controlled by a parameter. These reads have neither sequence bases, nor quality values, but do have a CIGAR string. I believe (but am not certain) that DeepVariant is attempting to parse these reads, and this is causing the error. I was not able to confirm, since I wasn't able to find the reference genome used to map. These reads can be validly ignored by DeepVariant. If this is the case, there are a few options to proceed.

Will DeepTrio reduce the number of these calls.; ```. Calls in DeepVariant which are 0/1-0/0-0/0 where a human inspection in IGV shows evidence in the parent are generally caused by:. 1. Reads which have a MAPQ below the threshold that DeepVariant sees (MAPQ < 5). ; 2. Regions which DeepVariant seems to think may represent a segmental duplication where reads are mapped from a different region. In these cases, DeepVariant can all a position as 0/0. In terms of overall precision, DeepTrio has higher precision on de novo calls (0/1-0/0-0/0) than DeepVariant [tables for this are in the manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.438434v1). In the cases that you mention, DeepTrio will more often designate the parent as a nocall (0/1-./.-0/0) for example. The genotype quality in the parents in DeepTrio can be useful for reducing the Type II error that you mention. If you want to further reduce these positions, I expect it would be possible to post-filter using the coverage values for the parent calls in the VCF (further filtering those that have a reasonable number of AD for ALT reads).

Availability,"Hi @jaspez yeah my apologies - when I read your comment more carefully, it seemed like you used `1`, so I removed my previous answer. `--gvcf_gq_binsize=1` will only merge records when they have identical GQ values, so there would be no loss of information at least in terms of GQ, but as you already saw this will not be exactly the same as what you specified (single line per position). Unfortunately we do not currently have an option to keep every single non-variant position, as this would make the gVCF files extremely large. In general I'd recommend not doing this anyway, since this will eventually slow down any downstream processing of the gVCFs such as merging gVCFs using GLnexus, etc. I think the easiest way to achieve this would be by post-processing the gVCFs generated with `--gvcf_gq_binsize=1`.

This expression will only consider variables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES collection -- if you need to warm-start non_TRAINABLE vars (such as optimizer accumulators or batch norm statistics), please use the below option.; ```; Because in our code, we use a regular expression like this:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/aff131aac3bd0cb63ee8314e32bcbf5590987fb8/deepvariant/modeling.py#L361. This means that only the variables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES get loaded when we warm start.; This explains why warm starting from a checkpoint does not produce the same (or even similar) results as the inference/prediction mode. For example, Batch norms were not being warmstarted. If you do want to load **everything**, one trick we've tried is to change to code into a list:; ```; vars_to_warm_start=['|'.join(vars_to_include)]); ```; which then tricks the code into the model of loading everything (not just TRAINABLE_VARIABLES). But, it doesn't seem very desirable because it also loads things like global_step. The best way is probably to include just BatchNorm and the Trainable variables we want, but it'll require more refactoring

Availability,"Hi @mclaugsf,. Let me give you a bit more context here on the runtime of call_variants. call_variants is the deep learning component of DeepVariant, so it relies on TensorFlow to execute the inception_v3 model used to evaluate our genotype likelihoods.
