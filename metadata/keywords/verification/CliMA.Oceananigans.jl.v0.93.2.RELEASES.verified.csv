Content: ## Oceananigans v0.43.0. [Diff since v0.42.0](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.42.0...v0.43.0). Release notes:. * Fixes a bug in `TwoDimensionalLeith` (PR #1073, issue #1034). Previously tests were being skipped due to extreme slowness. Now we run tests on GPU (but not CPU, where the closure is much slower to compile). * Rewrites the interface for ""scheduling"" output and diagnostics (PR #1070). Previously output and diagnostics were usually scheduled by specifying either `time_interval` or `iteration_interval` kwargs in the constrcutor for the object in question. Now, the relevant kwarg is called `schedule` and takes a callable `AbstractSchedule` object (or any user-defined function `func` that returns `true` or `false` depending on the single argument `func(model)`). This design is more flexible and extensible, and also simplifies underlying code. Four schedules are provided:. - `TimeInterval(interval)`; - `IterationInterval(interval)`; - `WallTimeInterval(interval)`; - `AveragedTimeInterval(interval; window=interval, stride=1)` (for time-averaging output). Breaking changes:. * Output writers and diagnostics no longer have the keyword arguments `time_interval` or `iteration_interval`. The most commonly-used features that are affected are `JLD2OutputWriter`, `NetCDFOutputWriter`, and `Checkpointer`. `JLD2OutputWriter` and `NetCDFOutputWriter` no longer have the kwargs `time_averaging_window` and `time_averaging_stride`. The specific syntax changes are:. * `time_interval=T` becomes `schedule=TimeInterval(T)`; * `iteration_interval=I` becomes `schedule=IterationInterval(I)`; * `time_interval=T, time_averaging_window=W` becomes `schedule=AveragedTimeInterval(T, window=W)`. **Closed issues:**; - Should we change 'OutputWriters' to 'Output'? (#706); - Possible elegant solution for compiling kernels with fields as arguments (#722); - Different output intervals for different field outputs using JLD2OuputWriter (#826); - More general criteria for writing d

These types are called `IsotropicDiffusivity` and `AnisotropicDiffusivity`; `ConstantIsotropicDiffusivity` and `ConstantAnisotropicDiffusivity` aliases are provided for backwards compatibility.; * Lots of new convergence tests confirming the accuracy of the model!. **Closed issues:**; - NormalFlow and NoNormalFlow instead of NoPenetration (#703); - Error showing value of type IncompressibleModel (#707); - Test that horizontal average is correct over time (#737); - [Documentation] Why use bit.ly link in documenation?
