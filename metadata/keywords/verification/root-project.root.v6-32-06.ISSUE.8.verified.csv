Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a series of log statements and function calls related to dynamic linking initialization in C/C++. These logs discuss events during the loading and initialization process of shared libraries. The descriptions focus on how resources are managed under varying load conditions, which relates to performance in terms of handling these processes efficiently without blocking or contention. This context aligns with the definition of performance as reducing blocked time through resource optimization. Therefore, it is a true positive."

This issue intends to merge the total used memory to include cached instead of just free which isn't strictly a correct solution. This PR implements the current approach utilised by **htop** which includes the following fields to calculate `MemUsed`, `MemAvailable` and `SwapUsed`:. ```; Int_t fMemAvailable; // available RAM in MB; Int_t fMemCached; // cached RAM in MB; Int_t fMemBuffer; // buffer RAM in MB; Int_t fMemShared; // shared RAM in MB; Int_t fSwapCached; // cached swap in MB; Int_t fSReclaimable // slab that might be reclaimed; ```. Results:. ```; ➜ ROOT free -h; total used free shared buff/cache available; Mem: 23Gi 3.4Gi 7.4Gi 214Mi 12Gi 19Gi; Swap: 7.6Gi 2.1Gi 5.5Gi; ```. ```; ➜ ROOT root -l; root [0] MemInfo_t memInfo; gSystem->GetMemInfo(&memInfo);; root [1] cout << memInfo.fMemTotal << "" "" << memInfo.fMemUsed << "" "" << memInfo.fMemFree << endl;; 23877 2786 7562; root [2] ; ```; Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally
