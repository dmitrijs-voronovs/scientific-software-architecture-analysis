ISSUE_COMMENT,Availability,218,avail,available,"It could be I was thinking of the pre-tiling days for cell detection, or maybe SLICs and subcellular detections on large images? And yes, I'm probably not typical :) Never used CZI images, so I have no idea about the effect of those. Anyway, giving a few things a shot. One thing I already noticed is that when I zip around an image and cap out the available memory that way, I tend to run into detection problems. However, as you say, this isn't a hardware memory limit problem, as I can lower the memory cap down to 2GB on a fairly large image (Annotation area 1.3x10^8 um^2) and have it run successfully, but slowly. If I fill up those 2 GB by looking around the image, though, it failed it's cell detection. Even on a comparatively small image (2.5x10^6 um^2) I ran into problems once the memory was filled. On the other hand, once I bumped the available memory up to 5GB, I stopped running into errors on the smaller image, though it was very difficult to fill the image buffer.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: It could be I was thinking of the pre-tiling days for cell detection, or maybe SLICs and subcellular detections on large images? And yes, I'm probably not typical :) Never used CZI images, so I have no idea about the effect of those. Anyway, giving a few things a shot. One thing I already noticed is that when I zip around an image and cap out the available memory that way, I tend to run into detection problems. However, as you say, this isn't a hardware memory limit problem, as I can lower the memory cap down to 2GB on a fairly large image (Annotation area 1.3x10^8 um^2) and have it run successfully, but slowly. If I fill up those 2 GB by looking around the image, though, it failed it's cell detection. Even on a comparatively small image (2.5x10^6 um^2) I ran into problems once the memory was filled. On the other hand, once I bumped the available memory up to 5GB, I stopped running into errors on the smaller image, though it was very difficult to fill the image buffer. On the larger image I could quite easily cap out the image buffer around 5GB and then sometimes ran into errors. Although sometimes the program would simply go over the 5GB limit and everything would be fine. I am afraid I wasn't able to find anything usefully consistent. .

ISSUE_COMMENT,Energy Efficiency,877,adapt,adaptive,"ever, this also implies that `Qobj` should fulfil the numpy ufunc interface; `Qobj` would be a container for data such that operations like `np.sin` is the elementwise sin, or (most notably) `np.multiply` is the *elementwise* multiplication. Our `Qobj` _does not_ fulfil the ufunc interface:; 1. elementwise operations don't make sense on quantum objects, which are arrays only as an implementation detail - the `Qobj` class is meant to represent an abstract linear algebra object, not specifically a matrix.; 2. we don't honour the `shape` guarantees of numpy as we test compatibility based on `dims`, which are not 1D (superoperators) so cannot follow numpy's broadcasting rules; 3. we treat multiplication as matrix multiplication, violating how `np.multiply` should behave. My main concern is point 1: I don't think that `Qobj` provides a similar object to an `ndarray` at all. Right now we _do_ use matrices underneath, but proposed additions to QuTiP such as symbolic `Qobj` and adaptive Hilbert spaces are compatible with the idea of ""abstract linear algebra objects"", but do not necessarily have a backing array.

When dual mode 32/64-bit systems came along, this choice unnecessarily complicated system interfaces because size_t (with long) was a different size under ILP32 and LP64 models. Reverting to int would have happened except that some implementations had already shipped 64-bit-only interfaces. The compromise was a type which could be defined to be any size by the implementation: socklen_t. I am not sure how to approach this, because the standardization of `socklen_t` seems fairly recent, but in the long run, avoiding this whole types dance altogether and simply using explicit `socklen_t` seems to make most sense and will make for a simpler code.

Content: TCP_NODELAY, (char*)val, &optlen) == -1) {; | ^~~~~~~; | |; | int*; In file included from /builddir/root-6.24.06/core/unix/src/TUnixSystem.cxx:101:; /usr/include/sys/socket.h:348:50: note: initializing argument 5 of 'int getsockopt(int, int, int, void*, socklen_t*)'; 348 | int getsockopt (int, int, int, void *__restrict, socklen_t *__restrict);; | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~; ```; is the next error. The problem stems from the fact, that the condition for using `socklen_t` is (among others) glibc:; ```c; #if (defined(R__AIX) && !defined(_AIX43)) || \; (defined(R__SUNGCC3) && !defined(__arch64__)); # define USE_SIZE_T; #elif defined(R__GLIBC) || defined(R__FBSD) || \; (defined(R__SUNGCC3) && defined(__arch64__)) || \; defined(R__OBSD) || defined(MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_4) || \; (defined(R__AIX) && defined(_AIX43)) || \; (defined(R__SOLARIS) && defined(_SOCKLEN_T)); # define USE_SOCKLEN_T; #endif; ```; [Here](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xsh_chap02.html#tag_22_02_10_06) is some context:; > All socklen_t types were originally (in BSD UNIX) of type int. During the development of POSIX.1-2017, it was decided to change all buffer lengths to size_t, which appears at face value to make sense. When dual mode 32/64-bit systems came along, this choice unnecessarily complicated system interfaces because size_t (with long) was a different size under ILP32 and LP64 models. Reverting to int would have happened except that some implementations had already shipped 64-bit-only interfaces. The compromise was a type which could be defined to be any size by the implementation: socklen_t. I am not sure how to approach this, because the standardization of `socklen_t` seems fairly recent, but in the long run, avoiding this whole types dance altogether and simply using explicit `socklen_t` seems to make most sense and will make for a simpler code. I will appreciate any comments, especially regarding any compatibility issues this might cause - else I will add this to the PR.

ISSUE_COMMENT,Performance,2044,optimiz,optimization,"@takutosato had a good suggestion: to stratify to low-complexity regions in the high-confidence regions. Not sure how many variants are there, but will take a look. EDIT: looks like it's ~5k / ~54k on chr22 in CHM. More generally, I think that defining the appropriate loss function for optimization to set ""default"" parameter values obviously has no unique answer. The problem is also made a little more complicated by our current strategy of sensitive calling + non-trivial filtering. But it would be great to come up with some hard constraints (e.g., we never want runtime/cost to exceed X, we always want to maintain Y metrics in these regions on these samples) and general procedures, then apply them as equitably as possible across all method/parameter changes. Also generally, I'm a bit wary of focusing too hard on the high-confidence regions, as this might lead to overfitting or could understate the potential of method/parameter changes in more difficult regions. But probably we'll have to downweight the loss or do more manual checks in low-confidence regions until we improve truth resources there.

Content:  helpful outside the class. It could also be handled with composition rather than inheritance by passing a Supplier<ReaderWrapper> as an argument to its constructor if really necessary, like when creating a ThreadLocal. If this change is made, ReaderPool could still be subclassed, but wouldn't have to be subclassed. I made `ReaderPool` a concrete class by using a `Supplier` like you suggested (well, not exactly a `Supplier` but a `Callable` because I needed to throw exceptions). I removed the child classes of `ReaderPool`. > Elsewhere ReaderPool contains a lot of logic for image reading, which feels like it belongs in the reader itself - not the pool for managing readers. And it's also quite Bio-Formats-focussed, since the idea of a series within an image is quite Bio-Formats-specific.; > ; > So overall I don't have a clear idea of the logical separation between ReaderWrapper and ReaderPool. It feels like the logic of image reading is now more split across more classes + Bio-Formats itself, and it's quite hard to trace what is happening.; > . I moved the image reading logic from `ReaderPool` to `ReaderWrapper`. > It only supports returning all pixels for all channels simultaneously. In preparation for the future, it would be beneficial to have an API that optionally supports returning individual channels.; > ; > * This isn't needed if the refactoring is minor.

By giving `mesolve` the Liouvillian instead of the Hamiltonian and collapse operators separately, you've already done most of its setup, so the time penalties should be much less than the current system (i.e. you avoid several Kronecker products and safety checks on the time-dependence terms because you've done them once at the start). In theory, that should already work from at least 4.5 onwards, and likely most of it will work from 4.4. In the 5.x series, almost all the intermediary operations should get a speed up as well (`Qobj.__init__` is getting its time slashed, and the line `current_liouvillian += control * operator` may be able to be replaced with one that applies the same in-place calculation optimisations that `mesolve` does internally). One thing you pay a nasty penalty for right now if that internally we'd keep column-stacking/unstacking the state, but in the 5.x branch it'll stop being represented internally by a sparse matrix, and instead it'll be a Fortran-ordered dense matrix, for which the stack/unstack is a free operation. In the form I've written it, this loop is thread-safe already. As it stands in the 4.x series, `mesolve` is re-entrant (I'm fairly sure), but note that it does generally mutate its arguments, especially if you pass",,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859873615,"The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage.

Content:  Turn it into a Liouvillian once, so we don't repeat the cost; base = qutip.liouvillian(base_hamiltonian, collapse_operators); state = ...; options = qutip.Options(store_states=False, store_final_state=True); for prev, time in zip(times[:-1], times[1:]):; controls = krotov.get_next_controls(time, state, ...); current_liouvillian = base.copy(); for control, operator in zip(controls, control_liouvillians):; current_liouvillian += control * operator; # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; # each of these terms is a single time-independent Qobj,; # and the sum is a single QobjEvo with all the uncontrolled; # time dependence already handled.; state = qutip.mesolve(current_liouvillian, state, [prev, time], options=options).final_state; ```. By giving `mesolve` the Liouvillian instead of the Hamiltonian and collapse operators separately, you've already done most of its setup, so the time penalties should be much less than the current system (i.e. you avoid several Kronecker products and safety checks on the time-dependence terms because you've done them once at the start). In theory, that should already work from at least 4.5 onwards, and likely most of it will work from 4.4. In the 5.x series, almost all the intermediary operations should get a speed up as well (`Qobj.__init__` is getting its time slashed, and the line `current_liouvillian += control * operator` may be able to be replaced with one that applies the same in-place calculation optimisations that `mesolve` does internally). One thing you pay a nasty penalty for right now if that internally we'd keep column-stacking/unstacking the state, but in the 5.x branch it'll stop being represented internally by a sparse matrix, and instead it'll be a Fortran-ordered dense matrix, for which the stack/unstack is a free operation. In the form I've written it, this loop is thread-safe already. As it stands in the 4.x series, `mesolve` is re-entrant (I'm fairly sure), but note that it does generally mutate its arguments, especially if you pass

Content: > > > Since we already have the full-cell grid-fitted IBM it might be better to just focus on that for now and later modify it to make it partial-step when everything is working well (I think we'd just need to modify the calculation of vertical areas and volumes, no?).; > > ; > > ; > > Not sure what you mean in terms of ""focus"". I wasn't proposing any work, just speculating about the potential advantages of shaved cells. Do you mean focus on full cell IBM for this particular test? I agree with that --- we don't have shaved cells so we can't test it ?; > ; > Sorry for not being clear. I meant focus for development. For example, I see you're planning on implementing a more general BC interface for IBMs in #2437. My point is that I think it would probably be easier to focus efforts on that kind of stuff first, make the full-step grid-fitted IBM (and its interface) functional, to only then try to improve the IBM implementation itself.; > ; > Hope that clarifies it. Oh for sure, we hope to have that stuff merged soon. Shaved cells are eons away (unless some intrepid external contrib wants to focus it) --- we can't look at that within Climate Modeling Alliance until we have realistic global solutions.

ISSUE_COMMENT,Testability,374,stub,stubs,"Hi! I think we have a different focus here, and not all of what you stated as fact is correct, so I’ll do my best to clear this up:. 1. There is an advantage for type hints in common Scanpy usage. IPython should use Jedi to create autocompletions since this summer, but they forgot to reenable it. I sent them an issue to do so, ipython/ipython#11503 and a fix in ipython/ipython#11506. Jedi supports type hints, so with `c.Completer.use_jedi = True` now or by default in a month, people will profit from them. Furthermore, people are using scanpy in applications and scripts, not just in notebooks. When you use an IDE (or install the jedi extension in EMACS) you should profit from it. 2. The Jupyter shift-tab help being hard to read in the presence of type hints is what I consider a bug. I reported it in ipython/ipython#11504 and fixed it in ipython/ipython#11505. 3. The numpy is on it (see [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-stubs)) and will probably integrate it once there needs to be no Python 2 compat. e.g. scikit-learn waits for numpy: scikit-learn/scikit-learn#11170. I see your concern about entry hurdles, but I don’t agree. It’s super easy. `Union` is “or”, `Optional` is “or `None`”. If there’s questions, they can be answered. (or people click on the links in the docs and read like one sentence of explanation). 4. If you want we can change how all that is rendered. `Union[a, b]` could be done as ``` :class:`a` or :class:`b` ``` But it’s really not hard…. Honestly I think the `Callable[…]` is much better than the textual description that was there before: Until it was there, people (including me when i was writing that annotation) had to dive into the code to figure out what function signature is *really* expected there.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Hi DarioS. FastaAlternateReferenceMaker is a really simple tool. It actually just looks at the alternate alleles at each site and uses the first non-symbolic one to make the fasta. It doesn't even look at the genotypes. So it should work fine with a multisample vcf but it will give you a mush of samples together as a single fasta. I could be extended to be smarter but it's not a high priority for us right now. . We should improve the documentation, I had to go look in the code to see what it was doing.

ISSUE_COMMENT,Usability,101,clear,clearer,"Hi!. Thanks for reaching out!. We have an option to compute connectivity based on minimum distance, right. The default choice, however, is based on edge-statistics (actual inter-edges between clusters vs. expected number of edges in random connections). Currently, I'm working on the revision of the algorithm. The option for minimum distance will disappear and everything will become much cleaner. I'm also trying to improve the statistical model for connectivity and provide a clearer option for its significance threshold. Right now, the only relevant option in the whole AGA [given the single-cell graph is computed and clustered] is `tree_based_confidence=True`; if you set this to `False`, the significance value for edges to appear will be much lower and you'll get a much sparser abstracted graph. However, this graph is sometimes too sparse. If `tree_based_confidence=True`, as per default, this works fine on very connected datasets, but sometimes gives results that are too dense on disconnected datasets. For now, you could simply try setting `tree_based_confidence=False` and see whether this is satisfying. If not; probably too sparse, it would be great if you could try the new AGA version in a couple of days. Also, I'd be very happy to run the method on your data and look at specific issues.

RELEASES,Availability,27,error,error,"This is a minor release, but it nonetheless adds a few important features and fixes an outstanding bug. This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed.

It is now possible to dump the equivalence class files `--dumpEq` when using Salmon in alignment-based mode.; ; * The [range-factorization](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i142/3953977) has been merged into the master branch. This allows using the data-driven likelihood factorization, which can improve quantification accuracy on certain classes of ""difficult"" transcripts. Currently, this feature interacts best (i.e., yields the most considerable improvements) when using alignment-based mode and when enabling error modeling `--useErrorModel`, though it can yield improvements in the mapping-based mode as well. This feature will also interact constructively with selective-alignment, which should land in the next (non-bug fix) release. * Added the `quantmerge` command. This allows producing a multi-sample TSV file with aggregated abundance metrics over samples from many different quantification runs. This can be useful to ease e.g. uploading of quantified data to certain online analysis tools like [Degust](http://degust.erc.monash.edu/). ; Other improvements, features and changes; -----. * The [multi-threaded read parser used by Salmon](https://github.com/rob-p/FQFeeder) has been updated to considerably improve CPU utilization. Specifically, the previous queue management strategy (busy waiting) has been replaced by an intelligent, bounded, exponential-backoff strategy. Many improvements (and much of the code) comes from [this series of blog posts](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/important

RELEASES,Deployability,51,release,release,"This is a major stable release of salmon and brings a lot of exciting new features with extensive benchmarking in the latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). This new version of salmon is based on a fundamentally different indexing data structure ([pufferfish](http://bit.ly/2m1OSr3)) than the previous version. It also adopts a different mapping algorithm; a variant of selective-alignment. The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthll` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta2; A bug r",,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.0.0,"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

A new [Wiki page](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/Changing-colors) has also been added to explain how to change the brightness and contrast of images, as well as to perform other kinds of color transforms. > **Note:** Be sure to check out the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/Installing-QuPath). ## Changelog; - Better support for ImageJ TIFF images, including multi-channel fluorescence, 16 and 32-bit.; - Improved sliders and behavior when working with z-stacks or time series.; - Improved behavior for 'Brightness/Contrast' pane, including ability to set channel color for fluorescence images by double-clicking on the channel name.; - Wand tool now uses current color transform information, giving another way to influence how it works.; - When sending back an annotation from ImageJ's macro runner, its shape will be automatically trimmed to fit inside the region that was sent to ImageJ.; - New 'Use calibrated location text' preference to toggle units used in the location text shown on the bottom right of the viewer.; - Default for new installations is to invert scrolling for Windows and Linux.; - Fixed 'Add intensity features' bug, where the median was calculated whether it was wanted or not.

RELEASES,Energy Efficiency,52,efficient,efficient,"/2m1OSr3)) than the previous version. It also adopts a different mapping algorithm; a variant of selective-alignment. The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences.

The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers.

It gathers metrics from different parts of the system; to inform its decision to stop the creation of jobs.; You can find relevant configuration in the `services.LoadController` section of the `cromwell.examples.conf` file,; as well as in the `load-control` section in `reference.conf`.; The load level of the monitored sub-systems are instrumented and can be found under the `cromwell.load` statsD path.; + The statsD metrics have been re-shuffled a bit. If you had a dashboard you might find that you need to update it.; Changes include: ; + Removed artificially inserted ""count"" and ""timing"" the path; + Added a `load` section; + Metrics were prefixed twice with `cromwell` (`cromwell.cromwell.my_metric`), now they're only prefixed once; + Added `processed` and `queue` metrics under various metrics monitoring the throughput and amount of queued work respectively; + Added a memory metric representing an estimation of the free memory Cromwell thinks it has left. * Added a configuration option under `docker.hash-lookup.enabled` to disable docker hash lookup.; Disabling it will also disable call caching for jobs with floating docker tags.; ; * **Rest API** ; + Updated the `/query` response to include the total number of query results returned. See [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api/RESTAPI/#workflowqueryresponse) for more information.; * **Language APIs** ; + The WDL library import from C

This new version of salmon is based on a fundamentally different indexing data structure ([pufferfish](http://bit.ly/2m1OSr3)) than the previous version. It also adopts a different mapping algorithm; a variant of selective-alignment. The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthll` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta2; A bug r",,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.0.0,"The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage.

It has been tested on an AWS aarch64 node (running Ubuntu 20.10), but presumably should work on many ARM machines. *It is assumed that NEON intrinsics are available*. This support for ARM was made immensely easier by [SIMDe](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde). Thanks to @mr-c and @BenLangmead for pointing out SIMDe project and to @mr-c, @lh3 and lead developer of SIMDe @nemequ who all gave useful advice on the initial expansion to ARM support. ## alevin-related changes. ### Support for RAD file creation and the alevin-fry pipeline. * `--rad`/`--justAlign` **flag** : Salmon/alevin 1.4.0 coincides with the initial release of [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), a flexible and efficient framework for single-cell quantification. Alevin-fry handles barcode-detection and quantification, providing the methods developed as part of alevin, as well as a number of other possibilities.

It has been tested on an AWS aarch64 node (running Ubuntu 20.10), but presumably should work on many ARM machines. *It is assumed that NEON intrinsics are available*. This support for ARM was made immensely easier by [SIMDe](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde). Thanks to @mr-c and @BenLangmead for pointing out SIMDe project and to @mr-c, @lh3 and lead developer of SIMDe @nemequ who all gave useful advice on the initial expansion to ARM support. ## alevin-related changes. ### Support for RAD file creation and the alevin-fry pipeline. * `--rad`/`--justAlign` **flag** : Salmon/alevin 1.4.0 coincides with the initial release of [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), a flexible and efficient framework for single-cell quantification.

Note though that it will require to go-run port.RunMergeInputs() on all input ports, which contains code that will merge from multiple inputs into the ports `InChan` channel, which can still be used to do range operations on, for simplicity. ## Full list of new commits in this release. - a584425e3387798026cecb48671d30df29f8adef Implement new feature: Allow multiple inputs in ports ; - 067df02e52a6424271b0dff8a2396346af7c511b Add ReadAuditFile() method in ip; - 5a38927672b01bd25900c4b8c2f7793ac4613b1e New feature: Read upstream audit info from existing audit log files, for files that exist; - ff94caf9c950afe39cfe1d3339671c37ceb018af Shorten method name: Port.{ConnectStrings -> ConnectStr}(); - 4433cf55b1a3e1c7967cad11b8129073b17f0863 API change: Shorter more sensible field names in audit log; - 55a193aea2c2e965c79b56a5f8136d00501630e6 Back to not create channel for new paramports, except in ConnectStrings(), to not trip up connect logic; - 0a4fb82784d0be51395c2c3f69268a8db9ffeb3a API change in task: new Param() accessor method; - 0d38b89c07d91e9935da66fe8c706a7bbce43ddd API change in task: GetInPath()->InPath(); - 3dd17bae89633ac833a96db6907ec73f54dcb673 New convenience method ParamPort.ConnectStrings() for simply sending one or more strings; - 183eab934d3f86e93789926b22cdb33085788acc Create chan in NewParamPort

Adding decoy sequence to the salmon index is simple, but salmon is specific about the manner in which the sequence is added. To ease this process, we have created a script that allows the automated creation of a decoy-enhanced transcriptome from a genome FASTA, transcriptome FASTA, and annotation GTF file. The script, as well as detailed instructions on how to run it an use its output, is provided [in the SalmonTools repository](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh). **Note**: Because making effective use of the decoy sequence requires having accurate mapping scores, the decoys are only used when salmon is run with selective alignment (i.e. with the flags `--validateMappings`, `--mimicBT2` or `--mimicStrictBT2`). #### Detailed description of decoy requirements. It is not necessary to use the script we provide to extract decoy sequences, and if you'd like to add your own decoys to the file you wish to index, the process is fairly straightforward. All records for decoy sequence must come at the _end_ of the FASTA file being indexed, and you must provide a file with all of the names (one name per line) of the records that should be treated as decoys (they need not be in the same order as in the FASTA file). Consider that you have the files `txome.fa` and `decoys.fa`, where `decoys.fa` are the decoy sequences you want to add to your index. Also, assume that `decoys.txt` is the file containing the names of the decoy records. You can create a valid input files as:. `$ grep ""^>"" decoys.fa | cut -d "">"" -f2 > decoys.txt`; `$ cat txome.fa decoys.fa > txome_combined.fa`; ; Now, you can build the decoy-aware salmon index using the command:; ; `$ salmon index -t txome_c",,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.14.0,"The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access.

Content: g strategy, _salmon v0.14.0 is not compatible with the indices of previous versions, and so you must re-build the index for this version of salmon_ (which must be done anyway, if one is adding decoy sequence). ### Adding decoy sequence to the salmon index. . Adding decoy sequence to the salmon index is simple, but salmon is specific about the manner in which the sequence is added. To ease this process, we have created a script that allows the automated creation of a decoy-enhanced transcriptome from a genome FASTA, transcriptome FASTA, and annotation GTF file. The script, as well as detailed instructions on how to run it an use its output, is provided [in the SalmonTools repository](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh). **Note**: Because making effective use of the decoy sequence requires having accurate mapping scores, the decoys are only used when salmon is run with selective alignment (i.e. with the flags `--validateMappings`, `--mimicBT2` or `--mimicStrictBT2`). #### Detailed description of decoy requirements. It is not necessary to use the script we provide to extract decoy sequences, and if you'd like to add your own decoys to the file you wish to index, the process is fairly straightforward. All records for decoy sequence must come at the _end_ of the FASTA file being indexed, and you must provide a file with all of the names (one name per line) of the records that should be treated as decoys (they need not be in the same order as in the FASTA file). Consider that you have the files `txome.fa` and `decoys.fa`, where `decoys.fa` are the decoy sequences you want to add to your index. Also, assume that `decoys.txt` is the file containing the names of the decoy records. You can create a valid input files as:. `$ grep ""^>"" decoys.fa | cut -d "">"" -f2 > decoys.txt`; `$ cat txome.fa decoys.fa > txome_combined.fa`; ; Now, you can build the decoy-aware salmon index using the command:; ; `$ salmon index -t txome_c

While these can all be customized, the defaults should be reasonable for typical use cases. ## other changes. * Salmon now enables the alignment error model _by default_ in alignment-based mode. This means that the `--useErrorModel` flag is no longer valid, since its behavior is now the default. This flag has been removed, and a new flag added in its place. Passing alignment-based salmon the `--noErrorModel` flag will turn off the alignment error model in alignment-based mode. * Related to the above; the alignment error model works best in conjunction with range factorization. Thus, the default behavior is now to turn on range-based factorization in alignment mode (in conjunction with the error model). * New default VB prior : The default _per-nucleotide_ VB prior has been changed to 1e-5. While this is _still_ an ongoing area of research, a considerable amount of testing is suggesting that variational Bayesian optimization with a sparsity inducing prior regularly leads to more accurate abundance estimates than the default EM algorithm. While we are leaving the EM algorithm as the default for the offline-phase in the current release, this may change in future versions. We encourage users who may not already be doing so to explore the variational Bayesian-based offline optimization feature of salmon (enabled with `--useVBOpt`). * The library type compatibility is now enforced _strictly_.

Content:  score that will be considered as a valid mapping (`--minScoreFraction`). While these can all be customized, the defaults should be reasonable for typical use cases. ## other changes. * Salmon now enables the alignment error model _by default_ in alignment-based mode. This means that the `--useErrorModel` flag is no longer valid, since its behavior is now the default. This flag has been removed, and a new flag added in its place. Passing alignment-based salmon the `--noErrorModel` flag will turn off the alignment error model in alignment-based mode. * Related to the above; the alignment error model works best in conjunction with range factorization. Thus, the default behavior is now to turn on range-based factorization in alignment mode (in conjunction with the error model). * New default VB prior : The default _per-nucleotide_ VB prior has been changed to 1e-5. While this is _still_ an ongoing area of research, a considerable amount of testing is suggesting that variational Bayesian optimization with a sparsity inducing prior regularly leads to more accurate abundance estimates than the default EM algorithm. While we are leaving the EM algorithm as the default for the offline-phase in the current release, this may change in future versions. We encourage users who may not already be doing so to explore the variational Bayesian-based offline optimization feature of salmon (enabled with `--useVBOpt`). * The library type compatibility is now enforced _strictly_. Previously mapping that disagreed with the inferred or provided library type simply had their probability decreased. Now, the default behavior is to discard such mappings. The new behavior is equivalent to running with the option `--incompatPrior 0`. The older behavior can be obtained by setting `--incompatPrior` to a small non-zero value. * The library format count statistics are now computed in a different (and hopefully less confusing) manner.

(#2515); * In composite (CBS) methods, extrapolation functions like `corl_xtpl_helgaker_2` must be referred to as strings, not objects. User-supplied ones use NumPy arrays rather than psi4.core.Matrix objects and must be registered with a `register_xtpl_function` function call. In any inputs where the cbs() function was referred to as an object (e.g., `energy(cbs)`), it must now be referred to by string (e.g., `energy(""cbs"")`). Functions analogous to `sherrill_gold_standard` must be referred to as strings and registered with `register_composite_function`. Running old inputs will trigger update guidance. (#2526, #2532, #2575); * The default `energy(""sapt0"")` code changed its default density-fitting basis, so it's more physically correct and matches `energy(""fisapt0"")` values but no longer matches values reported from high-level SAPT methods. (#2582); * Hessian calculations no longer always evaluate gradient beforehand to test safety of projecting rotations. Instead assuming unsafe. Can pass `ref_gradient` array to test on or `set findif fd_project T/F` explicitly to control. (#2575); * Previously, the CBS wrapper issued a `clean()` btwn calcs. Plain ""string modelchem"" calcs like `energy('hf/cc-pvdz')` were getting caught and also being cleaned, meaning their behavior was slightly different than `set basis cc-pvdz \n energy('hf')`. Now, string modelchem calcs behave like ""set"" calcs, so for occasional string modelchem calcs (that is, `energy|gradient|hessian(""mtd/bas"")` only), you may need to add a clean in the input. Signatures of this problem are PSIO errors a

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: a matrix. key strThe name of the column in adata.obs that differentiates; among experiments/batches. Cells from the same batch must be; contiguously stored in adata. basis str (default: 'X_pca')The name of the field in adata.obsm where the PCA table is; stored. Defaults to 'X_pca', which is the default for; sc.pp.pca(). adjusted_basis str (default: 'X_scanorama')The name of the field in adata.obsm where the integrated; embeddings will be stored after running this function. Defaults; to X_scanorama. knn int (default: 20)Number of nearest neighbors to use for matching. sigma float (default: 15)Correction smoothing parameter on Gaussian kernel. approx bool (default: True)Use approximate nearest neighbors with Python annoy;; greatly speeds up matching runtime. alpha float (default: 0.1)Alignment score minimum cutoff. batch_size int (default: 5000)The batch size used in the alignment vector computation. Useful; when integrating very large (>100k samples) datasets. Set to; large value that runs within available memory. kwargsAny additional arguments will be passed to; scanorama.assemble(). Return type:; None. Returns:; Updates adata with the field adata.obsm[adjusted_basis],; containing Scanorama embeddings such that different experiments; are integrated. Example; First, load libraries and example dataset, and preprocess.; >>> import scanpy as sc; >>> import scanpy.external as sce; >>> adata = sc.datasets.pbmc3k(); >>> sc.pp.recipe_zheng17(adata); >>> sc.pp.pca(adata). We now arbitrarily assign a batch metadata variable to each cell; for the sake of example, but during real usage there would already; be a column in adata.obs giving the experiment each cell came; from.; >>> adata.obs['batch'] = 1350*['a'] + 1350*['b']. Finally, run Scanorama. Afterwards, there will be a new table in; adata.obsm containing the Scanorama embeddings.; >>> sce.pp.scanorama_integrate(adata, 'batch', verbose=1); Processing datasets a <=> b; >>> 'X_scanorama' in adata.obsm; True. previous; scanpy.

Visualizing distributions across batches; Density plot; Partial visualizaton of a subset of groups in embedding. Integrating data using ingest and BBKNN#; The following tutorial describes a simple PCA-based method for integrating data we call ingest and compares it with BBKNN [Polanski19]. BBKNN integrates well with the Scanpy workflow and is accessible through the bbknn function.; The ingest function assumes an annotated reference dataset that captures the biological variability of interest. The rational is to fit a model on the reference data and use it to project new data. For the time being, this model is a PCA combined with a neighbor lookup search tree, for which we use UMAP’s implementation [McInnes18]. Similar PCA-based integrations have been used before, for instance, in [Weinreb18]. As ingest is simple and the procedure clear, the workflow is transparent and fast.; Like BBKNN, ingest leaves the data matrix itself invariant.; Unlike BBKNN, ingest solves the label mapping problem (like scmap) and maintains an embedding that might have desired properties like specific clusters or trajectories. We refer to this asymmetric dataset integration as ingesting annotations from an annotated reference adata_ref into an adata that still lacks this annotation. It is different from learning a joint representation that integrates datasets in a symmetric way as BBKNN, Scanorma, Conos, CCA (e.g. in Seurat) or a conditional V",stable/tutorials/basics/integrating-data-using-ingest.html,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,scanpy.readthedocs.io/en,scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/basics/integrating-data-using-ingest.html,"The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments.

Visualizing distributions across batches; Density plot; Partial visualizaton of a subset of groups in embedding. Integrating data using ingest and BBKNN#; The following tutorial describes a simple PCA-based method for integrating data we call ingest and compares it with BBKNN [Polanski19]. BBKNN integrates well with the Scanpy workflow and is accessible through the bbknn function.; The ingest function assumes an annotated reference dataset that captures the biological variability of interest. The rational is to fit a model on the reference data and use it to project new data. For the time being, this model is a PCA combined with a neighbor lookup search tree, for which we use UMAP’s implementation [McInnes18]. Similar PCA-based integrations have been used before, for instance, in [Weinreb18]. As ingest is simple and the procedure clear, the workflow is transparent and fast.; Like BBKNN, ingest leaves the data matrix itself invariant.; Unlike BBKNN, ingest solves the label mapping problem (like scmap) and maintains an embedding that might have desired properties like specific clusters or trajectories. We refer to this asymmetric dataset integration as ingesting annotations from an annotated reference adata_ref into an adata that still lacks this annotation. It is different from learning a joint representation that integrates datasets in a symmetric way as BBKNN, Scanorma, Conos, CCA (e.g. in Seurat) or a conditional V
