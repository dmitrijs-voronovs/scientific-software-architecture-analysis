Content: **salmon 1.4.0** : Thanksgiving release 🦃 . ## Bug fixes. * Fixed a _very rare_ bug whereby, on certain operating systems, under certain types of system load, and with specific versions of the C++ standard library, the `default` standard device would fail to produce a pseudorandom seed and would raise an exception. On these systems, ""/dev/urandom"" is explicitly substituted for the default random device. Unfortunately, it is not possible / easy to make the appropriate source changes at runtime. So, if you are experiencing this issue (which, again, looks to be exceedingly rare), it may be best to compile from source on the machine causing the issue. ## salmon-related changes. * salmon should now compile and run on ARM machines. It has been tested on an AWS aarch64 node (running Ubuntu 20.10), but presumably should work on many ARM machines. *It is assumed that NEON intrinsics are available*. This support for ARM was made immensely easier by [SIMDe](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde). Thanks to @mr-c and @BenLangmead for pointing out SIMDe project and to @mr-c, @lh3 and lead developer of SIMDe @nemequ who all gave useful advice on the initial expansion to ARM support. ## alevin-related changes. ### Support for RAD file creation and the alevin-fry pipeline. * `--rad`/`--justAlign` **flag** : Salmon/alevin 1.4.0 coincides with the initial release of [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), a flexible and efficient framework for single-cell quantification. Alevin-fry handles barcode-detection and quantification, providing the methods developed as part of alevin, as well as a number of other possibilities. Alevin-fry is computationally efficient, flexible, and _very_ memory efficient, *processing single-cell experiments in 2-3GB of memory* (see more details in the [poster](https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Accurate_efficient_and_uncertainty-aware_expression_quantification_of_single-cell_RNA-seq_data/13198100/1) introducing alevin-fry).

Nonetheless, [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry) currently, and for the forseeable future, will rely on alevin to perform the actual barcode / umi extraction, and mapping of sequencing reads. alevin communicates with alevin-fry via an intermediate binary file called a RAD (Reduced Alignment Data) file. To process data with alevin-fry (documentation available [here](https://alevin-fry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), you must first map the reads to the reference transcriptome to generate a RAD file. This is done by running alevin as you would normally do, and by additionally passing the flag `--rad` or `--justAlign`. This flag will tell alevin to just align the reads and to write the appropriate information to a RAD file in the output directory (with a pre-determined name). . * `--sketch`/`--sketchMode` **flag** : Alevin learned the `--sketch`/`--sketchMode` flag. This flag is currently relevant only in RAD mode. In fact, this flag currently implies RAD mode (that is `--sketch` is currently the same as `--rad --sketch`). The `--sketch` flag is meant to prioritize mapping speed at the potential cost of reduced specificity. It turns off selective-alignment and instead maps the reads using a custom implementation of psuedoalignment [[1]](#1) with structural constraints (PASC). This consists of executing the k-mer collecting part of a pseudoalignment [[1]](#1) algorithm to collect potentially compatible targets for a fragment, represented by a series of ""hits"". The targets are then filtered to ensure that the collected hits are consistent in their orientation, and co-linear in their placement on the fragment and reference (these are the enforced structural constraints).

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: alevin. * Moved from (deprecated) `tbb::atomic<double>` to `std::atomic<double>` throughout the codebase, including accounting for the lack of a `compare_and_swap` method on the latter. * Changed the default gap-open penalty to 6 (from 4). This makes any gap less preferred compared to a mismatch. **Note**: How to properly set the default scoring scheme, as well as how to set an ideal alignment quality threshold (i.e. what is the lowest quality alignment one should allow) is not a straightforward question. This change in default accords with our belief that gaps should be penalized more in typical data. However, the ideal settings for such parameters is certainly worthy of more in-depth study, and we are looking into both empirical and theoretical mechanisms for determining how these parameters can be best determined. To obtain the old (pre 1.3.0) scoring scheme, simply pass `--go 4` on the command line. You can also experiment with even more stringent gap penalties by increasing `--go` for gap open (current default `6`) and `--ge` for gap extend (current default `2`). * Changed warning message color from yellow to magenta to make it readable on both light and dark background (address #541). * Emojis in release notes :smiley:. ### :bug: Bug fixes. * Improved selective-alignment speed in pathological case involving isolated homopolymer MEM chains.

The behavior can now be described as: ""If a decoy sequence is a duplicate of any previously-observed sequence, it is discarded, regardless of the status of the --keepDuplicates flag."" This applies equally well if the decoy is a duplicate of a previously-observed decoy or if it is a duplicate of a _non-decoy_ target sequence.

The fix involves both addressing a bug in ksw2 where an incorrect alignment score for global alignment could be returned in certain rare situations depending on how the bandwidth parameter is set, and also by being more stringent in what alignments are inserted into the alignment cache and which mappings are searched for in the alignment cache. Many thanks to @csoneson for raising this issue and finding a dataset containing enough of the corner cases to track down and fix the issue. Thanks to @mohsenzakeri for isolating the underlying cases and figuring out how to fix them. . ### alevin; * The big feature hash generated when `--dumpBfh` is set, creates a reverse UMI sequences than those present originally. This was a legacy bug, introduced when shifting from jellyfish based 2-bit encoding to the `AlevinKmer` class based 2-bit encoding.

Specifically, the issue was unexpected behavior of bbhash during minimum perfect hash construction. It may create temporary files during MPHF construction, and it was using the current working directory to do this, with no option to override this behavior. We have fixed this in our copy of the bbhash code, and the salmon `index` command will now use the provided output directory as temporary working space for bbhash.

Previously, in the pufferfish-based index, target names of length > 255 were clipped to 255 characters.

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: or both CITE-seq and 10x feature barcoding).; * `--citeseq`: The command is used for quantifying the feature barcoded data where the alignment of the barcodes (with 1-edit distance) is done instead of the mRNA reads.; * No `--tgMap` is needed when using `--citeseq` single-cell protocol. * `--end 3` has been enabled in this release. It is useful for protocols where UMI comes before the Cellular Barcode (CB). *Note:* `--end 3` does _not_ start subsequencing from the 3' end of the R1 file. Instead, _alevin_ still starts counting the subsequence from the 5' end. However, we first sample the UMI instead of the CB. The idea here is, `--end 5` represents CB+UMI while `--end 3` represents UMI+CB and all the sequences beyond the |CB| + |UMI| length are ignored, no matter what value is set for the flag `--end`. Bug fixes; =========. * Fixed an issue (upstream in pufferfish), that is actually arising from [bbhash](https://github.com/rizkg/BBHash). Specifically, the issue was unexpected behavior of bbhash during minimum perfect hash construction. It may create temporary files during MPHF construction, and it was using the current working directory to do this, with no option to override this behavior. We have fixed this in our copy of the bbhash code, and the salmon `index` command will now use the provided output directory as temporary working space for bbhash. This issue has been reported upstream in bbhash as [issue 19](https://github.com/rizkg/BBHash/issues/19). * Fixed an issue with long target names (raised in issue [451](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/451)) not being allowed in the index. Previously, in the pufferfish-based index, target names of length > 255 were clipped to 255 characters. While this is not normally a problem, pipelines that attempt to encode significant metadata in the target name may be affected by this limit. With this release, target names of up to 65,536 characters are supported. Thanks to @chilampoon for raising this issue. * Fixed an

Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: e used for bias correction to be incorrect. The code was assuming zero-initalization of memory which was not necessarily occuring. **Note**: This bug affects runs performed under mapping-based mode (i.e. when the input was not coming from a BAM file) and when `--seqBias` or `--gcBias` flags (or both) were used. Depending upon the initialization of the underlying memory, the bug _may_ lead to unexpected results and diminished accuracy. The bug was present in versions 0.99.0 beta 1 through 1.0.0 (inclusive), and if you processed data using these versions in mapping-based mode with the flags mentioned above, _we encourage you to reprocess this data with the newest version, just in case_. We apologize for any inconvenience. * Fixed a bug that would occur when the input fasta file contained short sequences (<= length k) near the end of the file and bias correction (sequence-specific or fragment-GC) was enabled. This is particularly acute when the short sequence was immediately preceded by a very long target and would cause *inordinate* warning message printing to the log (hugely slowing down index loading). This printing to the log could slow the index loading considerably. Furthermore, this would provide sequence copies to short transcripts and decoy sequences even though they are not needed, which would result in unnecessary memory waste. The bug was due to a missing parenthesization to enforce the desired operator precedence. This fix should speed up index loading and reduce memory usage when using the `--seqBias` or `--gcBias` flags. *Huge* thanks to @mdshw5 for finding an input that would trigger this behavior (which didn't show up in testing), and for helping to track down the cause. * Fixed a bug that could occur in computing the Beta function component of the chaining score with *very* long queries. This should not have shown up at all with Illumina-length reads, but nonetheless the adjustment conceptually corrects the scoring for all cases. Thanks @mohsenzakeri.

The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthll` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta2; A bug related to alevin index parsing is fixed.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: This is the second beta version of the next major release of salmon. This new version of salmon is based on a fundamentally different indexing data structure ([pufferfish](http://bit.ly/2m1OSr3)) than the previous version. It also adopts a different mapping algorithm; a variant of selective-alignment. The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. Since it constitutes such a major change (and advancement) in the indexing and alignment methodology, we are releasing beta versions of this new realease of salmon to give users the ability to try it out and to provide feedback before it becomes the ""default"" version you get via e.g. Bioconda. Since it is not currently possible to have both releases and ""betas"" in Bioconda, you can get the pre-compiled executables below, or build this version directly from the `develop` [branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/develop) of the salmon repository. . **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo).

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: This is the first beta version of the next major release of salmon. This new version of salmon is based on a fundamentally different indexing data structure ([pufferfish](http://bit.ly/2m1OSr3)) than the previous version. It also adopts a different mapping algorithm; a variant of selective-alignment. The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. Since it constitutes such a major change (and advancement) in the indexing and alignment methodology, we are releasing beta versions of this new realease of salmon to give users the ability to try it out and to provide feedback before it becomes the ""default"" version you get via e.g. Bioconda.

In this case, it issues a warning, since we generally recommend to use this flag when indexing GENCODE transcriptomes (to avoid the very long transcript names in the output).

It is not necessary to use the script we provide to extract decoy sequences, and if you'd like to add your own decoys to the file you wish to index, the process is fairly straightforward.

Availability,robust,robust,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Safety,safe,safe,"sitions on a single transcript, this allows for improved mapping, since multiple positions for the individual reads will be propagated to the algorithm that selects the best mapping for the pair (which can take into account the expected pairing constraints). * Added new flag in mapping validation mode `--maxMMPExtension` (default value of 7). This flag limits the length of the MMP by which a match between the suffix array and read can be extended. Smaller values for this parameter can potentially increase the mapping sensitivity at the cost of requiring more suffix array lookups. The default value should generally work well, and increases the sensitivity with respect to unconstrained mapping validation with little impact on runtime. This heursitic is meant to approximate some of the ideas from [selective alignment](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3233589&dl=ACM&coll=DL). Note that this flag can be used in conjunction with `--consensusSlack` to increase the sensitivity of mapping in mapping validation mode (which is safe from the perspective of specificity as these mappings will be score anyway). For example, setting `--maxMMPExtension 5 --consensusSlack 7` would shorten maximum extensions even more, and consider many more _potential_ loci when chaining, which could lead to more sensitivity. However, the default values have been tuned to provide fairly high sensitivity for minimal extra computational expense. * Added a new flag in mapping validation mode `--mimicStrictBT2`. This flag attempts to mimic the *very* strict mapping parameters with which Bowtie2 is invoked when it is used with RSEM.

Quality Attribute: Safety
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: sitions on a single transcript, this allows for improved mapping, since multiple positions for the individual reads will be propagated to the algorithm that selects the best mapping for the pair (which can take into account the expected pairing constraints). * Added new flag in mapping validation mode `--maxMMPExtension` (default value of 7). This flag limits the length of the MMP by which a match between the suffix array and read can be extended. Smaller values for this parameter can potentially increase the mapping sensitivity at the cost of requiring more suffix array lookups. The default value should generally work well, and increases the sensitivity with respect to unconstrained mapping validation with little impact on runtime. This heursitic is meant to approximate some of the ideas from [selective alignment](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3233589&dl=ACM&coll=DL). Note that this flag can be used in conjunction with `--consensusSlack` to increase the sensitivity of mapping in mapping validation mode (which is safe from the perspective of specificity as these mappings will be score anyway). For example, setting `--maxMMPExtension 5 --consensusSlack 7` would shorten maximum extensions even more, and consider many more _potential_ loci when chaining, which could lead to more sensitivity. However, the default values have been tuned to provide fairly high sensitivity for minimal extra computational expense. * Added a new flag in mapping validation mode `--mimicStrictBT2`. This flag attempts to mimic the *very* strict mapping parameters with which Bowtie2 is invoked when it is used with RSEM. Specifically, it disallows orphans, indels in alignments, and dovetailing reads. It also sets the minimum score fraction (`--minScoreFraction`) to 0.8. We do *not* generally recommend using this flag, as these parameters tend to be overly strict and can eliminate many valid mappings / alignments.

Security,validat,validation,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

We highly-recommend that all users upgrade when they have the chance. . _Note_ : Due to the inclusion of the SHA512 hash in the salmon index (see in [other changes](#other-changes) below), existing salmon indices should be rebuilt. ## alevin. _Welcome alevin to the salmon family !_; ; You can find a tutorial describing how to use alevin [here](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/#blog). Working under the salmon engine, alevin brings new algorithms and infrastructure to perform single-cell quantification and analysis based on 3' tagged-end sequencing. The alevin mode is activated by using the `alevin` command, and currently supports quantification of [Drop-seq](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415005498) (`--dropseq`) and [10x v1/2](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14049) (`--chromium`) single-cell protocols (v1 chemistry requires use of a special wrapper). Alevin works on raw-FASTA/Q files and performs the following tasks:. * _Intial Whitelisting_: If not given `--whitelist` (an already known set of whitelisted barcodes e.g. as produced by Cell Ranger), alevin finds a rough estimate for the set of the whitelisted CB (Cellular Barcodes) based on their frequency. * _Barcode Correction_: In the first pass over the CB file, alevin constructs a dictionary for the correction of CB (if not on

(`--noSoftMap` is `true` ). * _UMI Correction & Deduplication_: alevin introduces a novel method for deduplicating the UMIs (Unique Molecule identifiers) present in a sample. Alevin's algorithm uses equivalence-class-level information to infer when the same UMI must arise from different isoforms of a gene (to avoid over-collapsing UMI counts), but also accounts for the fact that collisions between UMIs within a gene are expected to be very rare (i.e. if UMIs arise within different equivalence classes of a gene, they are most likely to derive from different positions in the same underlying molecule). To use a _baseline_ (i.e. simple gene-level) UMI deduplication algorthm, alevin can be used with `--naive` to disable its collision correction. * _CB classification_: Alevin uses various features in a machine-learning-based framework to classify the set of observed CBs that are likely to derive from valid captured cells (i.e. final whitelisting). This approach to CB classification is like that performed by the method of [Petukhov et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/13/171496).

Mapping validation is a new feature that allows salmon to validate its mappings via a traditional (affine-gap penalty) alignment procedure; it is enabled by passing the flag `--validateMappings`.

Second, this will help assign more appropriate mapping scores to reads that map to similar (but not identical) reference sequences --- essentially helping to appropriately down-weight sub-optimal mappings.

However, `--dumpCsvCounts` can be used to dump a human-readable count matrix. * _other features_: `--dumpfq` does fast concatentation of corrected CB to the read names of the sequence containing fastq file; `--dumpFeatures` dumps the features and counts used by alevin to perform the ML-based CB classification; `--dumpBfh` dumps th

Deployability,update,updated,"# Salmon 0.9.1 Release Notes. **Note**: Version 0.9.1 fixes a warning with the indexer that was introduced by an API change that occurred due to an updated Fasta/q parser. The warning does not affect the indexing process, but nonetheless, the proper API should be obeyed. Also, v0.9.1 fixes a very small but long-standing indexing bug that would cause a single k-mer (the lexicographically largest) to not be indexed properly. The Salmon v0.9.0 release notes are recapitulated below for the convenience of those upgrading directly from v0.8.2. As always, the newest release is easily installable via [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/salmon) and [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/combinelab/salmon/). ## New features. * During indexing, Salmon will now discard duplicate transcripts (i.e., transcripts with _exactly the same sequence_) by default. The information about the duplicate transcripts is written to a file in the index directory called `duplicate_clusters.tsv`.

Content: # Salmon 0.9.1 Release Notes. **Note**: Version 0.9.1 fixes a warning with the indexer that was introduced by an API change that occurred due to an updated Fasta/q parser. The warning does not affect the indexing process, but nonetheless, the proper API should be obeyed. Also, v0.9.1 fixes a very small but long-standing indexing bug that would cause a single k-mer (the lexicographically largest) to not be indexed properly. The Salmon v0.9.0 release notes are recapitulated below for the convenience of those upgrading directly from v0.8.2. As always, the newest release is easily installable via [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/salmon) and [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/combinelab/salmon/). ## New features. * During indexing, Salmon will now discard duplicate transcripts (i.e., transcripts with _exactly the same sequence_) by default. The information about the duplicate transcripts is written to a file in the index directory called `duplicate_clusters.tsv`. This is a two-column TSV file where the first column lists the name of a retained transcript and the second column lists the name of a discarded duplicate transcript (i.e., a transcript with identical sequence to the retained transcript, but which was discarded). **Note**: If you wish to retain multiple identical transcripts in the input (the prior behavior), this can be achieved by passing the Salmon indexing command the `--keepDuplicates` flag. * This is not a new feature, _per se_, but brings further parity between the alignment and mapping-based modes.

We urge you to move over to the `quasi` index if you are not already using it.; - Sequence-specific bias correction --- The old bias correction methodology has been removed from Salmon and replaced with a new sequence-specific bias correction model. Bias correction is enabled with the `--biasCorrect` flag. The new model has numerous benefits over the old. First, it should more accurately correct for sequence specific biases, leading to better estimates in biased samples. Second, it should not suffer from the same pathological ""over-correction"" failure cases of the old model --- if there is no substantial bias in the sample, it should have only a minimal effect on quantification results.; - New output format --- The new output format adds another column, `EffectiveLength`, to the output which records the effective length of each transcript. This is the third column, and the `TPM` and `NumReads` columns have both been shifted by 1. Also, the `quant.sf` output file has been simplified and now contains no comment lines. The first row in the file is an (un-commented) header that lists the column names, and the subsequent rows are the quantification estimates.; - Information about the command used --- Since the comment lines have been removed from the `quant.sf` file, this information (and more), which can sometimes be useful, has been output to other locations. There is a JSON formatted file in the top-level output directory called `cmd_info.json`. This contains a JSON structure with the relevant command line parameters (which used to appear in the `quant.sf` comments).; - Meta-information about the run --- Quite a bit of useful information appears in the file `aux/meta_info.json` under the main quantification directory.
