Usability,simpl,simply,"Hi, ; sry for bothering ;-) that's a solid point and I totally agree with you that tools should not be too complicated! . But i guess there isn't so much of additional complexity involved here... Fastp knows when it deals with PE data due to the `-i <input-1-file>` / `-I <input-2-file>` parameters; - If the user wants the paired unmerged files, this could simply be implicitly specified by `-o <output-1-file>` / `-O <output-2-file>`; - If merged reads are wanted, this is currently specified by `-m`. All you need to add is a related argument, so it would become `-m <merged-output-file>`; - If residual unpaired and unmerged reads are desired, just go for `-s <residual-output-file>`. So everything that needs to be changed would be a new argument to the `-m` parameter... ...and in addition, a new **optional** (and distinct from the merged read functionality) parameter/argument `-s <residual-output-file>` could be added. . I see that at least the second one can't be implemented right away and might take a while. But I would love to see this on the agenda because, by fulfilling these requirements, **fastp** would make a giant leap in terms your **an ultra-fast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor** credo.

Energy Efficiency,adapt,adapter,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.

So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you. Thanks!
