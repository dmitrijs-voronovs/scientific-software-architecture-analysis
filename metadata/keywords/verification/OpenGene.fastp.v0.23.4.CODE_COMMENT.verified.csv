Neither in() nor out(); are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to; inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.; The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero; amount of input may be provided by in(). For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by; setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in. If that input is exhausted, then; in() will be called. Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before; calling inflateBack(). If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called; immediately for input. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in; must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will; initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1]. The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the; first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called. These; descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-; supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job. On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to; pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call. The; return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR; if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error; in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature; of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized.; In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished; using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error. If; strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning; non-zero. (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is; assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.) Note that inflateBack(); cannot return Z_OK.; */

The; compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see; inflateSetDictionary). The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely; to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly; used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a; dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be; predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than; with the default empty dictionary. Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by; deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be; discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size; provided in deflateInit or deflateInit2. Thus the strings most likely to be; useful should be put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front. In; addition, the current implementation of deflate will use at most the window; size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary. Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the adler32 value; of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine; which dictionary has been used by the compressor. (The adler32 value; applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is; actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the; adler32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set. deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a; parameter is invalid (e.g. dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is; inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for

Content: e gzip header will have no; file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero), no; header crc, and the operating system will be set to 255 (unknown). If a; gzip stream is being written, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32. The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated; for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is; slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for; optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory usage; as a function of windowBits and memLevel. The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the; value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a; filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no; string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length; encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat; random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to; compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman; coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between; Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY.

Any information contained in the gzip; header is not retained, so applications that need that information should; instead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or inflateBack() and; perform their own processing of the gzip header and trailer. When processing; gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output; producted so far. The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer. inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed; or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has; been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a; preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was; corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check; value), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsisten

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: ressed data for the; operation to complete. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been; saved by the compressor for this purpose.) The use of Z_FINISH is not; required to perform an inflation in one step. However it may be used to; inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate(); call. Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the; stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint. If the stream; does not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not; enough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and; inflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had; been used. In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as; possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the; first call. So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are; on the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early; when Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of; memory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used. If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary; below), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary; chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets; strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,; total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described; below. At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed adler32; checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END; only if the checksum is correct. inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped; deflate data. The header type is detected automatically, if requested when; initializing with inflateInit2(). Any information contained in the gzip; header is not retained, so applications that need that information should; i

So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are; on the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early; when Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of; memory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used. If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary; below), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary; chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets; strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,; total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described; below. At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed adler32; checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END; only if the checksum is correct. inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped; deflate data. The header type is detected automatically, if requested when; initializing with inflateInit2(). Any information contained in the gzip; header is not retained, so applications that need that information should; instead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or inflateBack() and; perform their own processing of the gzip header and trailer. When processing; gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output; producted so far. The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer. inflate() returns Z_OK if some progre

It may introduce; some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when; forced to flush. The detailed semantics are as follows. inflate performs one or both of the; following actions:. - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in; accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not; enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing will; resume at this point for the next call of inflate(). - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out; accordingly. inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there is; no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below about; the flush parameter). Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least; one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more; output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly. The; application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for example; when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each call of; inflate(). If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it must be; called again after making room in the output buffer because there might be; more output pending. The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_FINISH,; Z_BLOCK, or Z_TREES. Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much; output as possible to the output buffer. Z_BLOCK requests that inflate(); stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary. When decoding; the zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately; after the header and before the first block. When doing a raw inflate,; inflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it; gets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data. The Z_BLO
