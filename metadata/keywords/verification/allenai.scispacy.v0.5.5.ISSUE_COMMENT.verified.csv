It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions.

I'm not sure if this makes sense, but think it would be great if instead, you could simply provide the paths to the necessary files directly when initiating a `CandidateGenerator`, so that you could do something like the following:. ```; candidate_generator = CandidateGenerator(; ann_index=""path/to/ann_index"",; tfidf_vectorizer=""path/to/tfidf_vectorizer"",; ann_concept_aliases_list=""path/to/ann_concept_aliases_list"",; kb=""path/to/kb"",; ); ```. I hope I explained my thoughts properly :-) Thanks and keep up the good work!!

Deployability,install,installing,"Hi @JohnGiorgi ,. This is caused by a couple of things:. 1. In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package.

I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has.

Deployability,release,release,"1) The version on the demo is probably not the latest release version. I should check and update that.; 2/3/4) First, this is a model, so inconsistent and surprising output is likely, and some memorization is likely (@DeNeutoy looks like data augmentation could help a lot here). Second, the BC5CDR corpus was annotated with specific guidelines (https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/media/store/files/2015/bc5_CDR_data_guidelines.pdf) which you may want to read and see if they align with your expectations of what would be annotated as a chemical. Here is some output of a mix of real and made up chemical names.

We were thinking about running some data augmentation experiments to try to improve the NER, but haven't done it yet (I'd be thrilled to have a contribution along those lines).; 5) Definitely the model takes into account the context that the word occurs in, so it is not wholly surprising to me that the same word could be classified differently in different contexts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/336#issuecomment-800691659,"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Content: Hi Daniel,. I tried to install nmslib again in a new py 3.9 environment and it looks like it actually did install but there were issues. The entire log from the install is below. I also successfully installed scispacy from pip which is great! I included the install log for scispacy below the log for nmslib. Maybe I did something wrong before when I created the env for scispacy?. I will be testing it soon and will let you know if anything else comes up. Thank you for following up with me on this.
