Availability,"Hi @ChantalvanSon ,. Great that you got it working, sorry it was a bit tricky. You raise some good points - there is one way that you can not require your function which loads all the pieces which is this:. ```python; from scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES; from scispacy.candidate_generation import (; CandidateGenerator,; LinkerPaths; ).

Overall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented). However I definitely see your point that we should try to make this a bit nicer. In another project I used to work on, we had the concept of using a decorator to register this type of info with the base class, so it can construct itself. That might be a bit of overkill here, but maybe we could provide a function which does this global mutation for you and throws intelligent errors if you e.g try to overwrite something in there? . I think you're right that we need to fix this if we want people to frequently be able to create their own very specific/custom linkers though so thanks for raising it!",error,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237#issuecomment-651504169:1695,errors,1695,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237#issuecomment-651504169,1,['error'],['errors'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

Content: Hi @ChantalvanSon ,. Great that you got it working, sorry it was a bit tricky. You raise some good points - there is one way that you can not require your function which loads all the pieces which is this:. ```python; from scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES; from scispacy.candidate_generation import (; CandidateGenerator,; LinkerPaths; ). CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA = LinkerPaths(; ann_index=""path/to/nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectorizer=""path/to//nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectors=""path/to/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib"",; concept_aliases_list=""path/to/concept_aliases.json"",; ); class UMLS2020KnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):; def __init__(; self,; file_path: str = ""path/to/2020AA.json"",; ):; super().__init__(file_path). # Admittedly this is a bit of a hack, because we are mutating a global object.; # However, it's just a kind of registry, so maybe it's ok.; DEFAULT_PATHS[""umls2020""] = CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA; DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES[""umls2020""] = UMLS2020KnowledgeBase. linker = CandidateGenerator(name=""umls2020""). ```. Overall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented). However I definitely see your point that we should try to make this a bit nicer. In another project I used to work on, we had the concept of using a decorator to register this type of info with the base class, so it can construct itself. That might be a bit of overkill here, but maybe we could provide a function which does this global mutation for you and throws intelligent errors if you e.g try to overwrite something in there? . I think you're right that we need to fix this if we want people to frequently be able to create their own very specific/custom linkers though so thanks for raising it!

Availability,"Hi @DeNeutoy, thanks for the information! I'm happy to share that I managed to create my custom Entity Linker based on the 2020AA release. It took a bit longer (~8 hours) to build the ANN index, but this could very well be because of the size of my UMLS subset (all level 0 sources + SNOMED). . Overall, it was not tóó difficult to do, but I think some small changes in the code would make it even easier. I don't have an answer to this question myself yet -- if I have time and I do think of a good solution, I will try to see if I can help out by creating a PR.

So is an enhancement necessary? It'd definitely be easier and more foolproof to simply add a parameter such as `cache_folder` to the `nlp.add_pipe()` method. For example:. ```python; nlp.add_pipe(; ""scispacy_linker"",; config={; ""resolve_abbreviations"": True,; ""linker_name"": ""umls"",; ""cache_folder"": ""/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/""}); ```. which would then be used to look for a subfolder `.scispacy`, i.e. `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/` in this case.

Availability,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score.

",False,"The provided content discusses methods for improving the representation of scientific documents using language models, specifically focusing on creating effective vector representations through a new system called SPECTER. This involves leveraging inter-document context and citations as a supervision signal to enhance document-level tasks like topic classification and recommendation. The focus is on improving the accuracy and utility of document representations without fine-tuning the model for specific tasks. There is no mention or implication of system readiness, reliability, recovery mechanisms, or fault masking. Instead, the content centers on enhancing the processing and understanding of scientific documents through advanced language models. Therefore, this does not align with the Availability quality attribute which pertains to a system's ability to function reliably when required."

Deployability,"Hi @JohnGiorgi ,. This is caused by a couple of things:. 1. In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package. The entity linker uses nmslib, an approximate nearest neighbour library to do sparse nearest neighbour search over tf-idf vectors for entities. I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has. If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:. `Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`. When I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2. 2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4.

",True,"The content provided is a series of error messages and warnings from running setup.py clean for nmslib. These include UserWarnings about deprecated usage of 'description-file' and setuptoolsDeprecationWarning about using setuptools.installer, which are related to dependency management during deployment. The logs also mention subprocess errors, which can affect the deployability as they indicate issues in installation or configuration. Therefore, this content accurately reflects potential issues with deployability by showing errors that prevent successful setup and deployment.

",True,"The content provided consists of log outputs from a pip installation process. It includes details about package installations, dependencies, and potential issues during installation such as failed cleaning of the build directory for nmslib. These logs are indicative of deployment challenges and can be seen as related to deployability as they pertain to successfully installing packages in an operational environment. The mention of failed builds and deprecation warnings suggests that deployment might not have been straightforward, aligning with aspects like automation and deployment speed mentioned in the Deployability description."

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The provided content appears to be part of a Python script's error log. It references specific file paths and functions related to package installation, such as setuptools.dist.py and pkg_resources.__init__.py. The context suggests that an error occurred during the installation process, specifically when trying to install numpy-1.23.4 for macOS. The fact that it mentions 'directory not empty' implies that there was an issue with creating or moving directories during the installation, which could be related to how dependencies are managed and deployed. This aligns with Deployability because it discusses deployment-related issues, particularly in terms of dependency management and ensuring a smooth deployment process. However, the content is almost entirely logs without any additional context that directly discusses deployability attributes like automation, deployment speed, or rollback options. The presence of error logs indicates a potential deployment failure but doesn't provide information about how deployment was attempted or its characteristics. Therefore, while the error relates to deployment, it does not clearly reflect deployability as defined by the attribute which focuses on capabilities like automation and deployment efficiency rather than specific error messages."

Deployability,"wing:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

I've just re-read the medmentions paper and it seems like they added much more detail about the st21pv subset - previously when I'd read it I thought it was much more specific to IR. I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker. It seems like some useful evaluations would be the following:. - P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset with gold mentions; - mention detection P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset. It would also be helpful to know the coverage of our kb on this subset as well as what % of annotated concepts in this subset have definitions.

",False,"The content provided is a log output from an installation process using Conda. It lists the packages being installed and their versions, which relates to deployment capabilities in that it shows successful installation of dependencies. However, while it does mention deployment-related packages (like confection, blis, etc.), this is more about dependency management during setup rather than directly addressing deployability. Deployability typically refers to the ability to deploy software efficiently and safely into an environment, which could involve aspects like automation or rollback mechanisms. The log here doesn't discuss these specific aspects but focuses on installation success."

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content provided is a series of log messages from running a Python setup script. It includes information about building wheels for various packages like 'termcolor' and 'PyYAML'. There are mentions of failed builds, specifically for 'nmslib', with an error related to incompatible colorama version. Additionally, it shows that some packages were successfully installed, such as 'networkx' and others. The content does not explicitly discuss the ease of combining systems or components (integrability) but rather focuses on the installation process using setup.py. The logs are technical in nature, detailing package installations and build statuses. While integrability deals with how well a system can be integrated with others, this log does not provide information about that specific attribute. Therefore, the content is more related to the installation process and dependency management rather than the actual integrability of systems or components."

5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content provided includes command outputs and error messages related to installing a Python package within Docker. These logs indicate issues during installation, such as failed builds and missing header files. However, since the original query was about Integrability, which deals with how well systems can be combined or integrated, this content does not directly discuss the integration aspects of a system. Instead, it focuses on installation errors, which is more related to build or dependency issues rather than system integration. Therefore, this content does not accurately reflect the quality attribute of Integrability."

Integrability,"wing:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate.

This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker. It seems like some useful evaluations would be the following:. - P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset with gold mentions; - mention detection P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content provided is a log snippet from a setup.py script showing installation attempts for various packages, including nmslib and awscli. This log does not directly discuss modifiability but rather describes the installation process. Modifiability refers to how easily a system can be modified or adapted, such as changing features or adjusting to new environments. The logs here focus on dependency resolution and installation status, which are related to build processes rather than system adaptability. Therefore, this content does not accurately reflect modifiability and is thus considered a false positive."
Modifiability,"Makes sense. So it seems to pretty much be working with a bit of a workaround. The files are initially cached to `/root/.scispacy/datasets/`. After caching, move the cache folder to a permanent folder on Google drive:. ```python; !mv /root/.scispacy/ /content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/; !ls /content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/; >>> datasets; ```. To update the environment variable, as described:. ```python; import os; os.environ['SCISPACY_CACHE'] = '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/'; ```. However, this alone does not find the cached files. It will re-download the files again. In order to see the new environment variable, it's necessary to restart the runtime: `Runtime->Restart runtime`. Now when running the entity linker, it will see the _permanently_ cached files. So is an enhancement necessary? It'd definitely be easier and more foolproof to simply add a parameter such as `cache_folder` to the `nlp.add_pipe()` method. For example:. ```python; nlp.add_pipe(; ""scispacy_linker"",; config={; ""resolve_abbreviations"": True,; ""linker_name"": ""umls"",; ""cache_folder"": ""/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/""}); ```. which would then be used to look for a subfolder `.scispacy`, i.e. `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/` in this case.",variab,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/415#issuecomment-1023716940:372,variable,372,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/415#issuecomment-1023716940,4,"['config', 'enhance', 'variab']","['config', 'enhancement', 'variable']","The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments.

Furthermore, the current solution is very memory intensive (RAM usage spikes at 8GB RAM when running the above example).

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: Hi @dakinggg, files are effectively cached, so it is simply about loading the UMLS index. ; @MichalMalyska, yes, this is approximately what I get (profiling output in the opening post). . The profiler shows that most of the time is spent decoding `json` objects:; ```; ncalls tottime percall cumtime percall filename:lineno(function); 3359672 16.912 0.000 16.912 0.000 .../python3.8/json/decoder.py:343(raw_decode); ```; I am wondering if there is a more efficient way to store, load and query the data. Furthermore, the current solution is very memory intensive (RAM usage spikes at 8GB RAM when running the above example). Two ideas for improvement are:; 1. `pyarrow` to store the alias list ; 2. `faiss` to improve upon the current nearest neighbour search (at least in terms of speed)?. Those are only suggestion as I don't know enough about the inner working of `scipacy`. Regarding my project, this issue is not critical, but that might be a nice improvement for the library.

Performance,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. . I am currently working on some integration stuff with `allennlp` (see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3040) to make it easier to hook in more complicated models, and I also want to try the entity linker from spacy too. I've just re-read the medmentions paper and it seems like they added much more detail about the st21pv subset - previously when I'd read it I thought it was much more specific to IR. I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker.

This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. . I am currently working on some integration stuff with `allennlp` (see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3040) to make it easier to hook in more complicated models, and I also want to try the entity linker from spacy too. I've just re-read the medmentions paper and it seems like they added much more detail about the st21pv subset - previously when I'd read it I thought it was much more specific to IR. I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker. It seems like some useful evaluations would be the following:. - P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset with gold mentions; - mention detection P/R/F1

",True,"The content provided appears to be error messages and warnings from running Python code, specifically related to package versions and dependency resolution during execution. This type of information is typically associated with system performance, especially when dealing with resource contention or optimization under varying loads.

Safety,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. . I am currently working on some integration stuff with `allennlp` (see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3040) to make it easier to hook in more complicated models, and I also want to try the entity linker from spacy too.

Safety,"wing:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

I've just re-read the medmentions paper and it seems like they added much more detail about the st21pv subset - previously when I'd read it I thought it was much more specific to IR. I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker. It seems like some useful evaluations would be the following:. - P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset with gold mentions; - mention detection P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset.

Testability,"Hi @JohnGiorgi ,. This is caused by a couple of things:. 1. In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package. The entity linker uses nmslib, an approximate nearest neighbour library to do sparse nearest neighbour search over tf-idf vectors for entities. I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has. If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:. `Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`. When I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2. 2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4. The Candidate Generator which the entity linker uses has a parameter which controls the speed/precision trade off for the approximate nearest neighbours search (the numbers here are measuring ANN queries per second). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16001974/97484674-4acf3300-1916-11eb-924e-12941df0fd6e.png).

Usability,"Hi @JohnGiorgi ,. This is caused by a couple of things:. 1. In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package. The entity linker uses nmslib, an approximate nearest neighbour library to do sparse nearest neighbour search over tf-idf vectors for entities. I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has. If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:. `Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`. When I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2. 2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4.

However, this alone does not find the cached files. It will re-download the files again. In order to see the new environment variable, it's necessary to restart the runtime: `Runtime->Restart runtime`. Now when running the entity linker, it will see the _permanently_ cached files. So is an enhancement necessary? It'd definitely be easier and more foolproof to simply add a parameter such as `cache_folder` to the `nlp.add_pipe()` method. For example:. ```python; nlp.add_pipe(; ""scispacy_linker"",; config={; ""resolve_abbreviations"": True,; ""linker_name"": ""umls"",; ""cache_folder"": ""/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/""}); ```. which would then be used to look for a subfolder `.scispacy`, i.e. `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/` in this case.

Usability,"No problem!. In answer to your questions:. 1. Right, the concept annotations are not used because we only are looking at string similarity to aliases from the kb. 2. Yes this is a bit complicated. It basically comes down to the following:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions. To do the same thing with respect to the candidate selection part, you can say ""for the mentions for which the top K contains the gold concept (i.e we did the generation step successfully), what is my accuracy with respect to this subset?"". This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The provided content appears to be log output from a package download and installation process. It includes details such as download speeds, file sizes, ETA times, and the names of packages being downloaded. While this information is important for understanding the installation process's efficiency, it does not directly relate to the usability attribute, which focuses on how user-friendly the software is or how easily users can complete tasks. Therefore, this log content is unrelated to usability as described. Since the content is purely logs with no other text, according to instruction 4, I mark it as a true_positive: false."
