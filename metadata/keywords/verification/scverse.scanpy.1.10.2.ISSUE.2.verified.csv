",False,"The content provided is a series of code snippets and error messages related to building a Python package using setuptools. The issue arises from a misconfiguration in the build process, specifically how data files are being handled for the 'scanpy' package. The traceback points to a TypeError where a list was expected but a list was not correctly handled. This is a specific bug in the build script rather than an example of integrability. Integrability would involve how different systems or components can be combined without issues, such as compatibility between modules or systems with varying interfaces.

",True,"The provided content discusses an issue in the scanpy library where setting figure parameters causes an infinite loop when run from IPython due to an interaction between matplotlib and IPython's display settings. The problem arises because IPython is trying to set matplotlib formats, leading to a loop that can only be exited by pressing Ctrl+D. By adding a conditional check to only execute this code if running from IPython, the infinite loop can be avoided. This situation directly relates to the integrability of the system components, as it involves integrating scanpy with other tools like IPython and matplotlib. The problem highlights compatibility issues between different libraries, which is a key aspect of what Integrability measures. Additionally, this issue could hinder the ability to integrate scanpy with other scripts or environments, further supporting its relevance to Integrability."

Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: ### Please describe your wishes and possible alternatives to achieve the desired result. No key inside 'use_rep' can mean 'X' or 'X_pca' was used for nearest neighbor calculation depending on the number of vars. It's storing things correctly if 'use_rep' is called explicitly. ```py; sc.pp.neighbors(combined_emb, n_neighbors=50); combined_emb.uns[""neighbors""][""params""][""use_rep""] -> KeyError. sc.pp.neighbors(combined_emb, n_neighbors=50, use_rep='X'); combined_emb.uns[""neighbors""][""params""][""use_rep""] -> 'X'; ```

",True,"The content provided is a log describing an error encountered when running the `sc.tl.ingest()` function in Scanpy. The user mentions that they are attempting to transfer labels from a reference dataset (adata_ref) to a query dataset (adata). They have subsetted both datasets to the same features and performed basic processing, including PCA, UMAP, and generating neighbor graphs. However, when running `sc.tl.ingest()`, they receive a ValueError stating that all input arrays must have the same shape. The minimal code sample provided includes steps where both datasets are processed similarly, but there might be an issue with how they're being combined or formatted for ingestion. This suggests that there's an integration problem between the two datasets, specifically related to the shapes of their data matrices. Since `ingest` is a functionality used for integrating datasets (as per Scanpy documentation), this log relates directly to the 'Integrability' quality attribute because it involves combining systems/components, in this case, datasets. The error points to a shape mismatch, which touches on interface compatibility and data structure alignment—key aspects of integrability. Therefore, the content accurately reflects issues related to integrating the two datasets, thus aligning with the Integrability quality attribute."

",True,"The provided content seems to be a bug report related to an error in scanpy's aggregate function when using 'obsm' and 'varm'. This issue involves a specific code example leading to a ValueError, indicating a problem with integrating certain data types into the system. The mention of 'obsm' and 'varm' relates to data structures used in scanpy, which are part of its data model. Since integrability concerns how well components can be combined (e.g., interfaces), this bug's context touches on the integration aspects between different parts of the system or with user-provided data. Therefore, even though it's a specific issue, it aligns with the broader concept of integrability as it deals with combining system components or data without errors."

",False,"The provided content seems to be about an issue encountered while installing scanpy, specifically regarding dependency conflicts with seaborn. It describes the problem where conda cannot find a version of scanpy that depends on a version of seaborn different from what's specified in pyproject.toml. This involves compatibility issues between systems (scanpy and its dependencies vs. existing packages in conda-forge). However, this is more about dependency resolution during installation rather than the integrability of the system itself. Integrability typically refers to how well two systems can be combined together once both are present, not so much about version mismatches during installation. Therefore, while it touches on compatibility between systems (a component of integrability), the main issue described is more about dependency conflicts arising from version misalignment rather than broader integration concerns. As a result, this content does not accurately align with the quality attribute of Integrability as defined."

",False,"The content discusses bugs related to normalization in scRNA-seq analysis and potential issues with log-transformation affecting downstream analyses. This touches upon how different components (in this case, data normalization steps) interact with each other and affect the overall system's performance. The issue of normalization and its impact on downstream processing is a form of integration problem between data processing steps. However, integrability typically refers to the ability to combine systems or modules without issues. While there is some overlap in the discussion regarding integration of data processing steps within the broader system, the primary focus here is more on functional correctness (accuracy) rather than the ease of integrating different components. Therefore, this content does not accurately reflect the quality attribute of Integrability as defined."
Integrability,"- [x] Additional function parameters / changed functionality / changed defaults?. At the moment when we are plotting data points in e.g., `sc.pl.umap()` with `color='covariate'` we determine the plotting order in two ways:; 1. if `'covariate'` is continuous the highest values are plotted on top, to showcase the peaks of the distribution;; 2. if `'covariate'` is a categorical variable, the order of `adata.obs_names` is used (i believe). As we often concatenate datasets after integration or loading from multiple sources, covariates we plot are usually not randomly ordered here. I think the first case is fine (and it can be turned off), but we should probably not be doing case 2. Instead, it would be good if the default was to plot in a random order unless the covariate is ordered internally (I believe this is already taken into account, but not sure).

Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: - [x] Additional function parameters / changed functionality / changed defaults?. At the moment when we are plotting data points in e.g., `sc.pl.umap()` with `color='covariate'` we determine the plotting order in two ways:; 1. if `'covariate'` is continuous the highest values are plotted on top, to showcase the peaks of the distribution;; 2. if `'covariate'` is a categorical variable, the order of `adata.obs_names` is used (i believe). As we often concatenate datasets after integration or loading from multiple sources, covariates we plot are usually not randomly ordered here. I think the first case is fine (and it can be turned off), but we should probably not be doing case 2. Instead, it would be good if the default was to plot in a random order unless the covariate is ordered internally (I believe this is already taken into account, but not sure). I have come across this issue several times now, and we're not solving this in a good way imo. Fabian has mentioned this to me several times as well. What do you think @fidelram @ivirshup ?

",True,"The content discusses integration aspects related to combining datasets and plotting order based on covariates, which ties into the ease of integrating different components (integrability).

",True,"The content provided discusses an issue encountered while using scanpy's regress_out function, leading to an ImportError. This issue pertains to functionality within scanpy, specifically when attempting to run a particular method, and involves dependency management or import errors. While it does not directly mention integrability, the problem is related to the integration of external libraries (dependencies) which is part of what integrability entails—the ease of combining systems or components. The error message points towards an issue with scipy's signaltools module, indicating potential compatibility or integration issues between scanpy and its dependencies. Thus, the content indirectly relates to integrability as it highlights a problem arising from the interaction and integration of different software components (scipy, scanpy, etc.)."

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The provided content appears to be code snippets from an Anaconda error log. It includes tracebacks and function calls related to reading H5AD files with scanpy, which could indicate issues with data integration or parsing. Since the issue described relates to successfully combining systems (in this case, attempting to read and process data), it tangentially touches on integrability but more directly points towards data processing errors. However, it's a stretch to categorize this under 'integrability' as the primary focus is on error handling rather than system integration."

The complexity in integrating different systems or components (possibly due to incompatible data types) leads to errors during integration, thus aligning with the Integrability quality attribute."

",True,"The content provided includes various software dependency versions and system information, such as package managers, Python versions, and environment details. This type of information is related to how well different components can be integrated with each other (syntactic compatibility, version management) which directly relates to the Integrability quality attribute.

",False,"The user is trying to integrate data using sc.tl.ingest but is encountering an error related to UMAP not having '_input_distance_func'. The issue appears when running the integration command, indicating a problem with the UMAP implementation. This relates to integrability because it's about combining different datasets (pbmc3k_processed and pbmc68k_reduced) through data integration steps. However, the user is facing an error that suggests a potential bug or incompatibility in the UMAP component during integration.

Integrability,"Can we use Dask to speed up the preprocessing phase of Scanpy by taking advantage of multiple CPUs (or GPUs)?. **TLDR**: Dask can speed up Zheng17, but it needs lots of cores and a rewritten implementation. CuPy (for GPUs) has missing operations required by Zheng17, so more work is needed for Dask with GPUs. ### Investigation. Dask is mainly used with dense arrays, however the arrays in Scanpy are sparse (for most of the preprocessing phase at least). I tried looking at [pydata sparse](https://sparse.pydata.org/en/latest/) with Dask, but it ran a lot slower than regular [`scipy.sparse`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) (which is what Scanpy uses). So I wrote a [wrapper](https://github.com/tomwhite/scanpy/blob/sparse-dask/scanpy/sparsearray/_scipy_sparse.py) around `scipy.sparse` to implement NumPy's `__array_function__` protocol.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: Can we use Dask to speed up the preprocessing phase of Scanpy by taking advantage of multiple CPUs (or GPUs)?. **TLDR**: Dask can speed up Zheng17, but it needs lots of cores and a rewritten implementation. CuPy (for GPUs) has missing operations required by Zheng17, so more work is needed for Dask with GPUs. ### Investigation. Dask is mainly used with dense arrays, however the arrays in Scanpy are sparse (for most of the preprocessing phase at least). I tried looking at [pydata sparse](https://sparse.pydata.org/en/latest/) with Dask, but it ran a lot slower than regular [`scipy.sparse`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) (which is what Scanpy uses). So I wrote a [wrapper](https://github.com/tomwhite/scanpy/blob/sparse-dask/scanpy/sparsearray/_scipy_sparse.py) around `scipy.sparse` to implement NumPy's `__array_function__` protocol. This allows sparse arrays to be chunks in a Dask array. This approach seemed promising, with basic operations able to take take advantage of multiple cores and run faster than regular `scipy.sparse`. However, when I first tried running the whole Zheng17 recipe, `scipy.sparse` was always faster than Dask with `scipy.sparse`, even with many cores (e.g. 64).

Integrability,"Hi all! I wanted to make you aware of a caching extension for scanpy and scvelo that @michalk8 and myself have developed called [scachepy](https://github.com/theislab/scachepy) and to kick off a discussion about caching in scanpy. From my point of view, there are currently two main ways to cache your results in scanpy, please correct me if I'm wrong:; - write the AnnData object; - manually write the attributes, e.g. adata.X to file, e.g. pickle.

Content: Hi all! I wanted to make you aware of a caching extension for scanpy and scvelo that @michalk8 and myself have developed called [scachepy](https://github.com/theislab/scachepy) and to kick off a discussion about caching in scanpy. From my point of view, there are currently two main ways to cache your results in scanpy, please correct me if I'm wrong:; - write the AnnData object; - manually write the attributes, e.g. adata.X to file, e.g. pickle. The idea of scachepy is to offer the possibility to cache all fields of an AnnData object associated with a certain function call, e.g. `sc.pp.pca`. It allows you to globally define a caching directory and a backend (default is pickle) that the cached objects will be written to. In the case of PCA, this would amount to calling. ```python; import scachepy; c = scachepy.Cache(<directory>) ; c.pp.pca(adata); ```; where `c.pp.pca` wraps around `sc.pp.pca` but takes additional caching arguments like `force`. So in short, our aim with scachepy is to....; - ...have a flexible and easy to use way to cache variables associated with scanpy/scvelo function calls.; - ... speed up individual steps in a scanpy/scvelo analysis by caching them, without having to save the entire AnnData object; - ... be able to share jupyter notebooks with someone else who can run them on a different machine, possibly on a different OS and yet get the exactly the same results because the critical computations are cached. @michalk8 is the main developer and will be able to tell you much more about it.

Integrability,"Hi all,. I am trying to use `ingest` to integrate different datasets.; I found a couple of issues. - `ingest` requires that the `var_names` are the same in the reference and the new object. I can select the intersection between the datasets; however, it requires that the genes are in the same order `if not ref_var_names.equals(new_var_names)`. I think this `if` could be modified using `set` (e.g., `len(set(ref_var_names).difference(set(new_var_names))) == 0`). I tried to order the `.var` dataframe, but the `.X` remains the same. In such a way, the expression of the genes does not correspond to the correct one. I can generate a dataframe and recreate the `.X`, but it could be very nice that the `.X` will be modified according to `.var` or `.obs` modifications (i.e., ordering). . - although it is possible to set `embedding_method=umap`, `ingest` requires the PCA components.

As discussed earlier, this pull request implements two core methods:; - `sc.pp.normalize_pearson_residuals()`, which applies the method to `adata.X`. Overall, the function is very similar in structure to `sc.pp.normalize_total()` (support for layers, inplace operation etc).; - `sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(flavor='pearson_residuals')`, which selects genes based on Pearson residual variance. The ""inner"" function `_highly_variable_pearson_residuals()` is structured similarly to `_highly_variable_seurat_v3()` (support for multiple batches, median ranks for tie breaking).

Both functions retain the raw input counts as `adata.X` and add fields for PCA/Normalization/HVG selection results (or return them) as applicable, most importantly the `X_pca` in `adata.obsm['pearson_residuals_X_pca']`.

In ‘Seurat’, I can read the data from my three treatments separated, do quality control, and then integrate them using ‘FindIntegrationAnchors’ and ‘IntegrateData’ functions. Then, I perform cluster analysis in the integrated dataset, and test the effect of treatment on the transcriptome of each cluster. . Is there a similar function in ‘Scanpy’ to integrate different datasets which are labeled in order to perform cluster analyses in the integrated dataset and test for the effect of treatment in the transcriptome of identified cell types? If so, is there a tutorial for that?. In ‘Scanpy’ I am able to import the data and perform quality control and cluster analysis. Thus, if there was a way of integrating the 3 different matrixes in one single object that would be helpful. Any suggestions on how I should proceed to integrate my data and perform differential gene expression analysis according to treatment and cell type?. Thank you very much!. Joao

Content: Hi, I was doing a dataset integration on quite some datasets. . ```py; adatas = [AT1,AT2,AT3,AT4,AT5,AT6,AT7] #each is an adata object from scRNA-seq. for i in adatas:; i.layers['counts'] = i.X. adatas = [AT1,AT2,AT3,AT4,AT5,AT6,AT7]. adata = ad.concat(adatas); adata.obs_names_make_unique. sc.pp.log1p(adata); sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(; adata,; layer=""logcounts"",; batch_key=""Sample"",; subset=True; ). scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, layer=""counts"", batch_key=""Sample""). vae = scvi.model.SCVI(adata, n_hidden=256); vae.train(); adata.obsm[""X_scVI""] = vae.get_latent_representation(); sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep=""X_scVI""); from scvi.model.utils import mde; import pymde; adata.obsm[""X_mde""] = mde(adata.obsm[""X_scVI""]); adata.obsm[""X_normalized_scVI""] = vae.get_normalized_expression(); adata.write_h5ad('Integrated.h5ad'); ```. So I did use make obs names unique after ad.concat(adatas). However, after I was finished with the integration and moving on to write_h5ad, it returns the following errors and tells me they can't write my h5ad cuz I have duplicated rows:. ```pytb; Feb 26 11:20:39 PM: Your dataset appears to contain duplicated items (rows); when embedding, you should typically have unique items.; Feb 26 11:20:39 PM: The following items have duplicates [60449 60452 60455 ... 70783 70784 70785]; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/home/joyzheng/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/anndata/_io/utils.py"", line 214, in func_wrapper; return func(elem, key, val, *args, **kwargs); File ""/home/joyzheng/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/anndata/_io/specs/registry.py"", line 171, in write_elem; _REGISTRY.get_writer(dest_type, (t, elem.dtype.kind), modifiers)(; File ""/home/joyzheng/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/anndata/_io/specs/registry.py"", line 24, in wrapper; result = func(g, k, *args, **kwargs); File ""/home/joyzheng/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/anndata/_io/specs/methods.py"", line 346, in write_vlen_string_array; f.create_dataset(k, data=elem.astype(st

If that's still the case, then please feel free to remove this PR. Here I make use of scipy's extremely nifty [LinearOperator](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.html) class to customize the dot product functions for an input sparse matrix.

Content: I know this (quite ancient) pull request has been open (#403), but I wasn't sure on its status. I think the consensus was to wait for sklearn to integrate the necessary changes? If that's still the case, then please feel free to remove this PR. Here I make use of scipy's extremely nifty [LinearOperator](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.html) class to customize the dot product functions for an input sparse matrix. In this case, the 'custom' dot product performs implicit mean centering. In my benchmarks, performing implicit mean centering in this way does not affect the runtime whatsoever.

This seems to be a better fit for the `preprocessing` package i.e. `sc.pp.dca(adata)` which overwrites `adata.X` with the denoised matrix. Users can use `copy=True` to keep adata.X of original matrix unchanged. The other use case is the low dimensional representations of cells produced by the encoder.

Content: I'd like to integrate DCA with scanpy and I need to ask some questions regarding that. . There are two use cases for DCA so far. One is denoising as a preprocessing step and using denoised matrix in downstream analyses, especially in the ones that require original feature space such as differential expression. This seems to be a better fit for the `preprocessing` package i.e. `sc.pp.dca(adata)` which overwrites `adata.X` with the denoised matrix. Users can use `copy=True` to keep adata.X of original matrix unchanged. The other use case is the low dimensional representations of cells produced by the encoder. This can also be used for the downstream analyses that do not require original feature space e.g. clustering, and visualization. This is more like `sc.tl.dca(adata)` which stores the new representation into `adata.obsm['X_dca']`. Optionally it can store dropout probabilities (pi matrix) and the dispersion, as well. However, having both sc.tl.dca and sc.pp.dca might be confusing for the users. Any suggestions?

5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The user is discussing integration aspects of DCA with scanpy. They mention two use cases and potential interface considerations between different parts of the system (e.g., sc.pp.dca vs. sc.tl.dca). This directly relates to how components can be combined, which is part of integrability."
Integrability,"I'd like to start using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) with scanpy and anndata. Pre-commit is essentially a tool that manages scripts we'd like to run before each commit, e.g. linting and formatting, so it becomes essentially impossible to forget these. I think this can allow PRs to progress faster since it gives us a way to codify formatting requirements – so we don't have to remember them – and have these checks happen locally – so we don't have to wait on CI. Of course, having these checks run depends on developers installing pre-commit, so we can also run these checks on CI ([example ci script](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml), [example run](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/38745/checks?check_run_id=1624558250)). There is a question of what things we'd like to add here. For sure: `black`. I think import checks (e.g. no unused imports) and `flake8` would be good too. We can also add custom checks for things like slow imports. I think this would be a good time to run `black` over the whole codebase so we don't have exempted files any more. My questions for the dev team:. * Does this sound good?; * Do you have more ideas for checks/ tools?. @michalk8, I saw you added this to [`squidpy`](https://github.com/theislab/squidpy/pull/203).

Integrability,"I'm not sure what t-SNE implementation is currently used in scanpy, but would it make sense to switch it to openTSNE? It's a Cython re-implementation of FIt-SNE, it's available on conda and should be very easy to depend on. As far as I understand the scanpy architecture, it builds a kNN graph and then runs downstream analysis (like UMAP or Louvain) on this kNN graph. Is that right? I suppose this is currently not implemented for t-SNE? With openTSNE it'd be easy to use the pre-built kNN graph and run t-SNE directly on that. Also, the default parameters of t-SNE in scanpy could IMHO be improved, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. Some of these recommendations (learning rate, initialization) are now default in openTSNE.

We had a brief discussion of this at openTSNE here https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: The Leiden algorithm is now [included](https://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#community_leiden) in the latest release of `python-igraph`, version 0.8.0. I believe this alleviates the need to depend on the `leidenalg` packages. The Leiden algorithm provided in `python-igraph` is substantially faster than the `leidenalg` package. It is simpler though, providing fewer options, but I believe the more extensive options of the `leidenalg` package are not necessarily needed for the purposes of `scanpy`. We provide binary wheels on PyPI and binaries for conda are available from the conda-forge channel, also for Windows.

It adds the following kind of functionality:; ```python; import scanpy as sc. adata = sc.datasets.pbmc68k_reduced(); sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain'). print(sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(adata, ""1"", n_top_genes=2)); ```; output is just the top 2 genes of the list.; ```; names scores logfoldchanges pvals pvals_adj; 0 FCGR3A 47.682064 5.891937 3.275554e-141 3.579712e-139; 1 FTL 45.653259 2.497682 9.003150e-208 6.887410e-205; ```. it also works for multiple groups:. ```python; print(sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(adata, None, n_top_genes=2)); ```; ```; group names scores logfoldchanges pvals pvals_adj; 0 0 CD3D 26.250046 3.859759 4.379061e-75 2.233321e-73; 1 0 LDHB 21.207499 2.134979 1.488480e-67 5.993089e-66; 2 1 FCGR3A 47.682064 5.891937 3.275554e-141 3.579712e-139; 3 1 FTL 45.653259 2.497682 9.003150e-208 6.887410e-205; 4 2 LYZ 38.981312 5.096991 1.697105e-172 1.298285e-169; 5 2 CST3 34.241749 4.388617 1.448193e-149 5.539337e-147; 6 3 NKG7 34.214161 6.089183 2.356710e-55 2.575547e-53; 7 3 CTSW 24.584066 5.091688 2.026294e-39 9.118324e-38; 8 4 CD79A 52.583344 6.626956 4.032974e-84 7.713062e-82; 9 4 CD79B 32.102913 4.990217 1.958507e-51 1.872822e-49; 10 5 FTL 26.084383 1.844273 1.236398e-74 2.364611e-72; 11 5 LST1 25.554073 3.170759 5.653851e-81 4.325196e-78; 12 6 LYZ 31.497107 4.328516 9.041131e-106 6.916466e-103; 13 6 CST3 23.850258 3.281016 2.491629e-83 9.530482e-81; 14 7 CST3 33.024582 4.195395 5.768439e-136 4.412856e-133; 15 7 LYZ 31.264187 4.267053 9.712334e-101 1.485987e-98; 16 8 PPIB 39.260998 3.990153 7.159966e-47 3.651583e-45; 17 8 MZB1 33.305500 8.979518 7.611322e-26 1.878278e-24; 18 9 STMN1 27.133045 5.9

",True,"The content discusses refactoring code related to plotting functions, such as sc.pl.dotplot and others, by creating new wrapper classes (DotPlot, MatrixPlot, StackedViolin) that extend a BasePlot class. This improves maintainability and extends the functionality of the plot types. It also mentions adding flexibility through method chaining, which aligns with the concept of integrability in software engineering as it allows for more modular and scalable integration of new features without complicating existing interfaces. The code changes involve moving common code to a shared location and allowing independent additions of features via new methods, which reduces redundancy and improves compatibility across different plot types."
Integrability,"This PR adds a module `sc.metrics` for functions which wouldn't modify an anndata object, but are useful calculations.

I'm open to this not being a module, but I think these methods should be available and I'm not sure where they'd fit within the current api. My vision for this module is to make it easier to calculate values based on values you'd get using the scanpy ecosystem.

Those functions are wrappers around `scanpy.api.pl.heatmap`, `scanpy.api.pl.stacked_violin`, `scanpy.api.pl.dotplot` and `scanpy.api.pl.matrixplot`. `heatmap` and `dotplot` were modified to allow the 'brackets' on top of the images.

Content: This PR introduces a family of plots to validate gene markers obtained using `scanpy.api.tl.rank_genes_groups`. The plots work similarly as `scanpy.api.pl.rank_genes_groups`:; ; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/43768141-efa3633a-9a36-11e8-856f-3970352c33a8.png). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/43768035-b8ba9082-9a36-11e8-91e6-8c828f456981.png). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/43768064-c78dc64c-9a36-11e8-95ed-351ef6fff99e.png). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/43768099-d776a510-9a36-11e8-9708-959d5d0afe92.png). Those functions are wrappers around `scanpy.api.pl.heatmap`, `scanpy.api.pl.stacked_violin`, `scanpy.api.pl.dotplot` and `scanpy.api.pl.matrixplot`. `heatmap` and `dotplot` were modified to allow the 'brackets' on top of the images. This functionality can be used directly from those plots. E.g.:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/43771788-83bbb604-9a40-11e8-90d6-51f084343a98.png). The `pl.stacked_violin` plot was before part of `pl.violin` but I thought that the code is cleaner by separating the two plots. Also, this PR adds the new plot `scanpy.api.pl.matrixplot` that plots the average gene expression per category. E.g.:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/43771966-07c9bd92-9a41-11e8-818e-263dfae69b7f.png). This PR also updates several test for the plotting options and adds new ones. . I tried to update the documentation to reflect the changes. Also a new dataset called `pbmc68k_reduced` was added. This dataset is used for tests and for the example notebook [here](https://gist.github.com/fidelram/2289b7a8d6da055fb058ac9a79ed485c). This dataset contains around 700 cells and 200 genes from the original 68k 10x genomics dataset and is saved as a small anndata object.

",True,"The content provided is a code snippet that manipulates an object called 'adata' using functions from scanpy, which is a tool for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data. It sets verbosity to 3 for more output, then loads PBMC3k data, performs PCA with a specified solver, creates neighbors for cells, and runs the Louvain algorithm with resolution 2.0 and adds a key 'newkey'. The code also retrieves the uns (uniform network structure) of 'adata' after these operations. This is about setting up computational steps to analyze scRNA-seq data, which relates to integrating data into an analysis framework. While not directly discussing integration between systems or components, it does demonstrate modular steps in processing data, which could relate to system integrability through modularity and separable components that can be added without affecting each other. The code's use of 'key_added' suggests parameterization for different configurations, which is a form of integrability by allowing parameters to be adjusted and combined flexibly."

However, I feel like there's more of a loss of information here and less of an obvious return type. Maybe in future this could get a `return_type: type[AnnData] | type[Dict] | type[xr.Dataset] = AnnData` argument that controls what is returned?. WDYT @ilan-gold @Intron7?

",True,"The content discusses the behavior of an AnnData object when passed into functions and how different types of input lead to different outputs (AnnData or dict). This relates to the integrability because it deals with how well components can be integrated, in this case, considering type compatibility and expected return types when integrating functions or data. The mention of `singledispatched` under the hood suggests potential complexities in integration that might affect overall system integrability."

",True,"The provided code snippet appears to be part of a data processing step where an AnnData object is being manipulated for testing purposes. The code creates a 'normalised' layer in the AnnData object and attempts to visualize gene expression using scanpy's highest_expr_genes function.

",True,"The provided code snippet shows an attempt to write data into a HDF5 dataset using some Python libraries.

The error message indicates that the file contains more than one genome, which conflicts with how legacy h5 files are structured. However, the user clarifies that this is not a legacy file but output from CR v6.0.0. This suggests that there's an issue with how the H5 file is structured or formatted for newer versions of 10x Genomics tools, possibly in terms of data organization and integration compatibility. The user also questions whether only one genome can be selected despite multiple being available, which points to a potential problem in how integrability is handled between different versions or components.

",True,"The provided code snippet and error output relate to an issue in using specific functions (e.g., sc.pl.violin), which involves integrating or combining components of a system (e.g., AnnotationData). The error message specifically points out problems during data processing steps, such as transforming string annotations into categoricals.

The error trace points towards issues with the SVD solver being used, specifically the 'arpack' solver, which might not be handling numerical instabilities well.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
