Availability," or other similar arguments these should; refer to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21. Fourth and finally, if running in training mode the `truth_vcf` and; `confident_regions` arguments should point to VCF and BED files containing the; true variants and regions where we are confident in our calls (i.e., calls; within these regions and not in the truth_vcf are considered false positives).; These should be bgzipped and tabix indexed and be on a reference consistent with; the one provided with the `--ref` argument. ### call_variants. `call_variants` consumes TFRecord file(s) of tf.Examples protos created; by `make_examples` and a deep learning model checkpoint and evaluates the model; on each example in the input TFRecord. The output here is a TFRecord of; CallVariantsOutput protos. `call_variants` doesn't directly support sharding its; outputs, but accepts a glob or shard-pattern for its inputs. `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and uses TensorFlow for evaluation.; When evaluating a model in CPU mode, TensorFlow can make use of multiple cores,; but scaling is sub-linear. In other words, `call_variants` on a 64 core machine; is less than 8x faster than running on a 8 core machine. When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs; fewer CPUs.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content:  or other similar arguments these should; refer to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21. Fourth and finally, if running in training mode the `truth_vcf` and; `confident_regions` arguments should point to VCF and BED files containing the; true variants and regions where we are confident in our calls (i.e., calls; within these regions and not in the truth_vcf are considered false positives).; These should be bgzipped and tabix indexed and be on a reference consistent with; the one provided with the `--ref` argument. ### call_variants. `call_variants` consumes TFRecord file(s) of tf.Examples protos created; by `make_examples` and a deep learning model checkpoint and evaluates the model; on each example in the input TFRecord. The output here is a TFRecord of; CallVariantsOutput protos. `call_variants` doesn't directly support sharding its; outputs, but accepts a glob or shard-pattern for its inputs. `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and uses TensorFlow for evaluation.; When evaluating a model in CPU mode, TensorFlow can make use of multiple cores,; but scaling is sub-linear. In other words, `call_variants` on a 64 core machine; is less than 8x faster than running on a 8 core machine. When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs; fewer CPUs. Based on a small number of experiments, currently the most efficient; configuration for `call_variants` on a GPU instance is 4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU.; Compared to our setting in the [whole genome case study], we noticed a 2.5x; speedup on the call_variants step using a single P100 GPU and 8 CPUs. Note that; currently `call_variants` can only use one GPU at most.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: current inference code?. No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in; Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. ## Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs?. No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU; inference yet. ## Can model_train be run on multiple GPUs?. No. TensorFlow's Estimator API does provide support for running training on; multiple GPUs through the use of a DistributionStrategy. However,; DistributionStrategy cannot be used with exponential moving average (EMA), which; is present in the DeepVariant codebase. ## What is the realigner and how does it work?. From the; [DeepVariant 2018 manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235.epdf?author_access_token=q4ZmzqvvcGBqTuKyKgYrQ9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NuM3saQzpZk8yexjfPUhdFj4zyaA4Yvq0LWBoCYQ4B9vqPuv8e2HHy4vShDgEs8YxI_hLs9ov6Y1f_4fyS7kGZ):. > Mapped reads are preprocessed using an error-tolerant, local; > De-Bruijn-graph-based read assembly procedure that realigns them according to; > their most likely derived haplotype.

The selection criteria; > for a candidate window are very permissive so that true variation is unlikely; > to be missed. All candidate windows across the genome are considered; > independently. De Bruijn graphs are constructed using multiple fixed k-mer; > sizes (from 20 to 75, inclusive, with increments of 5) out of the reference; > genome bases for the candidate window, as well as all overlapping reads.

You can read the; [docker build] documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start running, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. An aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its corresponding index file; (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a sequencing instrument,; using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; DATA_HTTP_DIR=""https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/quickstart-testdata"". mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam.bai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.bed; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz.tbi; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.fai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz.fai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/ucsc.hg19.ch

",True,"The provided content details updates to training data collection and processing methods across various software versions (v0.8 to v1.2). This includes adjustments such as excluding certain regions (like chr20), adding new data sources, and modifying data generation parameters like `downsample_fraction`. These changes are related to the system's ability to handle and process data reliably, which aligns with the concept of Availability in software engineering, where systems must be ready and capable of performing their required functions when needed. The updates ensure that training data is sufficient and appropriate, thereby supporting the overall system reliability and availability."
Availability,"ost likely haplotypes are; > selected that best explain the read evidence. The likelihood function used to; > score haplotypes is a traditional pair HMM with fixed parameters that do not; > depend on base quality scores. This likelihood function assumes that each read; > is independent. Finally, each read is then realigned to its most likely; > haplotype. This procedure updates both the position and the CIGAR string for; > each read. Local realignment is not performed for long reads (PacBio, and other similar; technologies). The realigner step can optionally be switched off using; `--norealign_reads`. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. This can be done by passing the following parameters:; `--make_examples_extra_args=""emit_realigned_reads=true,realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads""`. Note that this is meant for debugging and produces a bam file for every; candidate variant, which can result in millions of tiny bam files, so when using; this, narrow down the DeepVariant run using `--regions` to just the variants you; want to inspect more closely. ## How are `AD` and `DP` values calculated?. In order to efficiently perform variant calling, DeepVariant partitions the; genome into chunks (set by `--partition_size`), and will read in a max number of; reads into each partition (set by `--max_reads_per_partition`). By default,; `--partition_size` is set to 1000 and `--max_reads_per_partition` is set to; 1500. The `AD` and `DP` values are based on the read depths constrained by; `--max_reads_per_partition`. For example, if you have a depth of 2000x at a given site, DeepVariant will; subsample 1500 reads, and `DP` or `AD` will be capped at 1500. If you want to; calculate the true `AD` and `DP` values at high-depth regions, you can set; `--max_reads_per_partition=0` to calculate `AD` and `DP` using all reads. In; practice, capping reads per partition reduces runtimes with little/no impact on; accuracy. ##",down,MatchSource.DOCS,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/v1.6.1/docs/FAQ.md:12545,down,12545,docs/FAQ.md,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/v1.6.1/docs/FAQ.md,1,['down'],['down'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: ost likely haplotypes are; > selected that best explain the read evidence. The likelihood function used to; > score haplotypes is a traditional pair HMM with fixed parameters that do not; > depend on base quality scores. This likelihood function assumes that each read; > is independent. Finally, each read is then realigned to its most likely; > haplotype. This procedure updates both the position and the CIGAR string for; > each read. Local realignment is not performed for long reads (PacBio, and other similar; technologies). The realigner step can optionally be switched off using; `--norealign_reads`. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. This can be done by passing the following parameters:; `--make_examples_extra_args=""emit_realigned_reads=true,realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads""`. Note that this is meant for debugging and produces a bam file for every; candidate variant, which can result in millions of tiny bam files, so when using; this, narrow down the DeepVariant run using `--regions` to just the variants you; want to inspect more closely. ## How are `AD` and `DP` values calculated?. In order to efficiently perform variant calling, DeepVariant partitions the; genome into chunks (set by `--partition_size`), and will read in a max number of; reads into each partition (set by `--max_reads_per_partition`). By default,; `--partition_size` is set to 1000 and `--max_reads_per_partition` is set to; 1500. The `AD` and `DP` values are based on the read depths constrained by; `--max_reads_per_partition`. For example, if you have a depth of 2000x at a given site, DeepVariant will; subsample 1500 reads, and `DP` or `AD` will be capped at 1500. If you want to; calculate the true `AD` and `DP` values at high-depth regions, you can set; `--max_reads_per_partition=0` to calculate `AD` and `DP` using all reads. In; practice, capping reads per partition reduces runtimes with little/no impact on; accuracy. ##

Deployability,"; Google Cloud Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data; through the corresponding public URLs. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepTrio in one command. Although DeepTrio can be built from a source, we provide a docker image that; allows to run through all steps in one command to generate VCF/gVCF output files; from input BAM files and the reference. If you want to compile the binaries for yourself, we also have a [Dockerfile]; that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the [docker build]; documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. For each sample, one aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its; corresponding index file (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a; sequencing instrument, using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: ; Google Cloud Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data; through the corresponding public URLs. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepTrio in one command. Although DeepTrio can be built from a source, we provide a docker image that; allows to run through all steps in one command to generate VCF/gVCF output files; from input BAM files and the reference. If you want to compile the binaries for yourself, we also have a [Dockerfile]; that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the [docker build]; documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. For each sample, one aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its; corresponding index file (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a; sequencing instrument, using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}.

Because `postprocess_variants` combines and sorts the output of `call_variants`,; it needs to see all of the outputs from `call_variants` for a single sample to; merge into a final VCF. `postprocess_variants` is single-threaded and needs a; non-trivial amount of memory to run (20-30 GB), so it is best run on a; single/d

Content: tputs of `make_examples` and `call_variants` stages can be found; in the directory. After the command, you can find these files in the directory:. ```; call_variants_output_child.tfrecord.gz; call_variants_output_parent1.tfrecord.gz; call_variants_output_parent2.tfrecord.gz. gvcf_child.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz; gvcf_parent1.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz; gvcf_parent2.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz. make_examples_child.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz; make_examples_parent1.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz; make_examples_parent2.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz; ```. For running on GPU machines, or using Singularity instead of Docker, see; [Quick Start](deepvariant-quick-start.md) or; [DeepVariant PacBio case study](deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md). ## Merge VCFs using GLnexus. At this step we take all 3 VCFs generated in the previous step and merge them; using GLnexus. ```bash; sudo docker pull quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7. # bcftools and bgzip are now included in our docker images.; # You can also install them separately.; sudo docker run \; -v ""${PWD}/output"":""/output"" \; quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7 \; /usr/local/bin/glnexus_cli \; --config DeepVariant_unfiltered \; /output/HG002.g.vcf.gz \; /output/HG003.g.vcf.gz \; /output/HG004.g.vcf.gz \; | sudo docker run -i google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; bcftools view - \; | sudo docker run -i google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; bgzip -c > output/HG002_trio_merged.vcf.gz; ```. After completion of GLnexus command we should have a new merged VCF file in the; output directory. ```; HG002_trio_merged.vcf.gz; ```. ## Benchmark on chr20. ### Calculate Mendelian Violation rate. ```bash; sudo docker pull realtimegenomics/rtg-tools. sudo docker run \; -v ""${PWD}/input"":""/input"" \; -v ""${PWD}/reference"":""/reference"" \; realtimegenomics/rtg-tools format \; -o /reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.sdf ""/reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta"".

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content describes steps for merging VCF files using GLnexus and Docker commands, which relates to deployment procedures in software development ( deployability ). It talks about the process of combining data, which involves setting up environments and executing commands, akin to deploying code into an operational environment with defined steps. However, the term 'Deployability' is more about the capability to deploy software rather than data merging. The content discusses VCF file merging, which is a specific step in data processing rather than software deployment."

In order to efficiently perform variant calling, DeepVariant partitions the; genome into chunks (set by `--partition_size`), and will read in a max number of; reads into each partition (set by `--max_reads_per_partition`). By default,; `--partition_size` is set to 1000 and `--max_reads_per_partition` is set to; 1500. The `AD` and `DP` values are based on the read depths constrained by; `--max_reads_per_partition`. For example, if you have a depth of 2000x at a given site, DeepVariant will; subsample 1500 reads, and `DP` or `AD` will be capped at 1500. If you want to; calculate the true `AD` and `DP` values at high-depth regions, you can set; `--max_reads_per_partition=0` to calculate `AD` and `DP` using all reads. In; practice, capping reads per partition reduces runtimes with little/no impact on; accuracy. ## Missing variant calls near the edge of a contig. This is a known issue that we don't currently address. Please see:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/505 for more context. ## Why does DeepVariant PASS variants that have such a low read depth ~2 ?. Please see the answers provid

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content:  They would create five resultant gVCF record values with `--gvcf_gq_binsize 5`,; with relevant values of:. ```bash; start | INFO | GQ; ------------------; 1 | END=3 | 8; 4 | END=4 | 27; 5 | END=7 | 47; 8 | END=8 | 45; 9 | END=9 | 33; ```. By synthetically downsampling a 50x coverage whole genome and applying different; GQ binning strategies, we see how the size of the resultant data varies as the; two factors change. The below figure shows the size of output (measured as the; number of records generated relative to the baseline of a 50x whole genome with; `--gvcf_gq_binsize 1`) at different coverage levels, for GQ bins of size 1, 3,; 5, and 10. The value of each bar is written in blue font above it for clarity. ![gVCF size](images/DeepVariant-gvcf-sizes-figure.png?raw=true ""DeepVariant gVCF sizes""). ### Runtime. Despite the creation of many additional records, the running time of; `make_examples` increases minimally when gVCF support is enabled. The; single-threaded `postprocess_variants` program is more adversely affected, with; observed runtimes increasing on the [WGS case study] from ~25 minutes to 5-7; hours depending on genome coverage. ### New option to include MED_DP. Starting in v1.2.0, we added a flag to enable adding MED_DP (median read; coverage seen in the block) in addition to the default MIN_DP (minimum read; coverage seen in the block). To test it, you can follow the steps in [Quick Start], and in the step where; you run the one-step script `/opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant`, add this; flag:. ```bash; --make_examples_extra_args=""include_med_dp=true""; ```. Then, if you look at your output gVCF, you'll see the additional MED_DP; information, like:. ```; #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT NA12878; chr20 10000000 . T <*> 0 . END=10000116 GT:GQ:MIN_DP:MED_DP:PL 0/0:50:45:58:0,135,1349; ```.

",True,"The content discusses aspects related to the integrability of systems by mentioning gVCF records and how different bin sizes affect integration. It also talks about runtime performance which touches on system integration aspects but isn't directly about integrability. The mention of new options like MED_DP adds functionality that enhances integration capabilities, contributing positively to integrability. However, there's an emphasis on runtime which is more about operational efficiency than integrability. Overall, the content partially aligns with integrability by discussing added features and integration impacts but also includes non-integrability related information."

",True,"The content includes several log lines related to GPU usage and configuration issues in DeepVariant.

The mention of moving from Slim to Keras also affects how models are integrated and trained, contributing to integration complexity. Therefore, these log entries align with the concept of Integrability as they deal with combining different systems or components (e.g., switching platforms), compatibility issues, and technical risks associated with GPU integration."
Integrability," handles the creation; of the final gVCF file that incorporates both the non-variant records and the; true variants discovered by the previous programs. Two additional flags are required in `postprocess_variants`, the input; `--nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path <filename>` which corresponds to the TFRecord; of Variant protocol buffers created in `make_examples`, and the output; `--gvcf_outfile <filename>` which is the final gVCF output.

The number of non-variant records created when running DeepVariant in gVCF; depends highly on the sequencing depth of the input sample. This is because the; gVCF records at adjacent sites are merged when the genotype qualities are equal,; and we limit the possible genotype quality seen to be at most 50. For; deeply-sequenced individuals (e.g. 30-50x coverage), many sites hit the GQ=50; cap and are merged into few records. Samples with lower sequencing depth have; more sites within the dynamic range of the binomial model used to estimate; non-variant site genotype quality, and thus more records are created. To mitigate this effect, the `make_examples` program has a flag; `--gvcf_gq_binsize <int>`. This flag allows the merging of adjacent records that; all have GQ values within a bin of the given size, and for each record emits the; minimum GQ value seen within the bin. For example, setting `--gvcf_gq_binsize 5` has the effect that adjacent records; with GQ=0; GQ in [1, 5]; GQ in [6, 10]; GQ in [11, 15]; etc. are binned; together.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: ## Building DeepVariant from sources. DeepVariant comes with scripts to build it on Ubuntu 20.04. It can likely be; built and run on other unix-based systems with some minimal modifications to; these scripts. One way to get access to a machine running Ubuntu is through a; cloud computing platform like Google Cloud Engine. First install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads),; because we will need to use its `gsutil` command to fetch some dependencies. The `build-prereq.sh` command below will install a number of system packages to; fulfill DeepVariant's prerequisites (using apt-get and pip, invoked via sudo).; This commands also downloads and builds TensorFlow and CLIF from source. First run `sudo su`, and then run the following commands to install; prerequisites, build the DeepVariant programs, and then run tests. ```shell; ./build-prereq.sh. ./build_and_test.sh; ```. At the end of the output of that last command, you should see a summary message; like ""Executed 55 out of 55 tests: 55 tests pass."" along with the message; ""Target //deepvariant:binaries up-to-date:"" followed by a list of the just-built; deepvariant binaries. ## Preparing a machine to run DeepVariant.

Modifiability,"# DeepTrio. ## Overview. DeepTrio is built on top of DeepVariant. It is intended for variant calling of; trios or duos. The main advantage of DeepTrio is that genetic inheritance is; considered by a neural network for calling variants in trio samples. Also,; variant candidates are generated from all samples at once, which ensures a; genotype call is made for any position in the trio with a variant. Since; DeepTrio is built on top of DeepVariant,; [general information](deepvariant-details.md) for DeepVariant also applies to; DeepTrio. At the highest level, a user needs to provide the following:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format); format and its corresponding; [.fai index file](http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html) generated using the; `samtools faidx` command. 1. An aligned reads files for child and one or two parents in; [BAM](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) format and its corresponding; index file (.bai). The reads must be aligned to the reference genome; described above. The output of DeepTrio is a set of variants in; [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf) format representing the; child and one or two parents. Similar to DeepVariant, DeepTrio is composed of three stages: `make_examples`,; `call_variants`, and `postprocess_variants`. Some of the components (; `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`) are shared with DeepVariant, and; `make_examples` is specialized for DeepTrio. More details about each program are; described in detail in the; [Inputs and outputs](deepvariant-details.md#inputs-and-outputs) section of the; DeepVariant documentation.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability

Content: # DeepTrio. ## Overview. DeepTrio is built on top of DeepVariant. It is intended for variant calling of; trios or duos. The main advantage of DeepTrio is that genetic inheritance is; considered by a neural network for calling variants in trio samples. Also,; variant candidates are generated from all samples at once, which ensures a; genotype call is made for any position in the trio with a variant. Since; DeepTrio is built on top of DeepVariant,; [general information](deepvariant-details.md) for DeepVariant also applies to; DeepTrio. At the highest level, a user needs to provide the following:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format); format and its corresponding; [.fai index file](http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html) generated using the; `samtools faidx` command. 1. An aligned reads files for child and one or two parents in; [BAM](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) format and its corresponding; index file (.bai). The reads must be aligned to the reference genome; described above. The output of DeepTrio is a set of variants in; [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf) format representing the; child and one or two parents. Similar to DeepVariant, DeepTrio is composed of three stages: `make_examples`,; `call_variants`, and `postprocess_variants`. Some of the components (; `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`) are shared with DeepVariant, and; `make_examples` is specialized for DeepTrio. More details about each program are; described in detail in the; [Inputs and outputs](deepvariant-details.md#inputs-and-outputs) section of the; DeepVariant documentation. DeepTrio comes with three models for different types of input data:. * Illumina whole genome data (WGS).; * Illumina whole exome data (WES).; * PacBio HiFi whole genome data (PacBio WGS). ## Running DeepTrio. The easiest and recommended way to run DeepTrio is using; `google/deepvariant:deeptrio-latest` docker image. Please refer to the; [quick start guide](dee

Runtime was measured on; [n1-standard-64](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#n1_machine_types); machines. ## Starting from v1.2.0, we include `samtools` and `bcftools`. Based on user feedback ([GitHub issue #414](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/414)),; we added samtools and bcftools in our Docker image:. ```bash; docker run google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" samtools; ```. and. ```bash; docker run google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" bcftools; ```. You can read more about samtools and bcftools here: http://www.htslib.org/doc/. ## Commands for requesting machines used in case studies. We report runtime in our case studies documentation. In order to make sure the; results we report are reproducible without too much variation, we provide the; commands we used here to show you what kind of machines we ran the case studies; on. This is NOT the fastest or cheapest configuration. ### Command for a CPU-only machine on Google Cloud Platform. We used a 64-core (vCPU) machine with 240GiB of memory and no GPU, on the Google; Cloud Platform. Specifying the CPU platform also allows us to report the runtime; more consistently. ```shell; gcloud compute instances create ""${USER}-cpu"" \; --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \; --image-family ""ubuntu-2004-lts"" \; --image-project ""ubuntu-os-cloud"" \; --machine-type ""n1-standard-64"" \; --boot-disk-size ""300"" \; --zone ""us-west1-b"" \; --min-cpu-platform ""Intel Skylake""; ```. ### Command for a GPU machine on Google Cloud Platform. ```shell; gcloud compute instances create ""${USER}-gpu"" \; --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \; --maintenance-policy ""TERMINATE"" \; --accelerator=type=nvidia-tesla-p100,count=1 \; --image-family ""ubuntu-2004-lts"" \; --image-project ""ubuntu-os-cloud"" \; --machine-type ""n1-standard-16"" \; --boot-disk-size ""300"" \; --zone ""us-west1-b"" \; --min-cpu-p

A few things to note before we start:. * It is recommended to use BAM files with original quality scores. In the case; that BAM files went through recalibration, optional DV flags can be used in; order to use original scores: `--parse_sam_aux_fields`,; `--use_original_quality_scores`.; * DeepVariant optionally allows gVCF output. This option is required for; further GLnexus analysis in this document. ## Dataset. The Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset we're using is from:. [ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/). * HG002_NA24385_son; * HG003_NA24149_father; * HG004_NA24143_mother. ### Commands for downloading the input BAMs. Just for convenience, we use aria2 to download our data.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: eepVariant is highly accurate for; [many types of NGS data](https://rdcu.be/7Dhl), some users may be interested in; training custom deep learning models that have been optimized for very specific; data. This case study describes one way to train such a custom model using a GPU, in; this case for BGISEQ-500 data. Please note that there is not yet a production-grade training pipeline. This is; just one example of how to train a custom model, and is neither the fastest nor; the cheapest possible configuration. The resulting model also does not represent; the greatest achievable accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data. ## High level summary of result. We demonstrated that by training on 1 replicate of BGISEQ-500 whole genome data; (everything except for chromosome 20-22), we can significantly improve the; accuracy comparing to the WGS model as a baseline:. * Indel F1 `94.1615%` --> `98.1937%`; * SNP F1: `99.8785%` --> `99.9042%`. This tutorial is meant as an example for training; all the other processing in; this tutorial were done serially with no pipeline optimization. ## Request a machine. For this case study, we use a [GPU machine] with 16 vCPUs. You can request this; machine on Google Cloud using the following command:. ```bash; host=""${USER}-deepvariant-vm""; zone=""us-west1-b"". gcloud compute instances create ${host} \; --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \; --maintenance-policy ""TERMINATE"" \; --accelerator=type=nvidia-tesla-p100,count=1 \; --image-family ""ubuntu-2004-lts"" \; --image-project ""ubuntu-os-cloud"" \; --machine-type ""n1-standard-16"" \; --boot-disk-size ""300"" \; --zone ""${zone}"" \; --min-cpu-platform ""Intel Skylake""; ```. After a minute or two, your VM should be ready and you can ssh into it using the; following command:. ```bash; gcloud compute ssh ${host} --zone ${zone}; ```. Once you have logged in, set the variables:. ```bash; YOUR_PROJECT=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT; OUTPUT_GCS_BUCKET=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GCS_BUCKET. BUCKET=""gs://deepvariant""; VERSION=

To test it, you can follow the steps in [Quick Start], and in the step where; you run the one-step script `/opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant`, add this; flag:. ```bash; --make_examples_extra_args=""include_med_dp=true""; ```. Then, if you look at your output gVCF, you'll see the additional MED_DP; information, like:. ```; #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT NA12878; chr20 10000000 . T <*> 0 .

Content: ------------------------------------------------------------------------: | -----------; [Docker](docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md) | This is the recommended method.; [Build from source](docs/deepvariant-build-test.md) | DeepVariant comes with scripts to build it on Ubuntu 20.04. To build and run on other Unix-based systems, you will need to modify these scripts.; Prebuilt Binaries | Available at [`gs://deepvariant/`](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant). These are compiled to use SSE4 and AVX instructions, so you will need a CPU (such as Intel Sandy Bridge) that supports them. You can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file on your computer, which lists these features under ""flags"". ## Contribution Guidelines. Please [open a pull request](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/compare) if; you wish to contribute to DeepVariant. Note, we have not set up the; infrastructure to merge pull requests externally. If you agree, we will test and; submit the changes internally and mention your contributions in our; [release notes](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/releases). We apologize; for any inconvenience. If you have any difficulty using DeepVariant, feel free to; [open an issue](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/new). If you have; general questions not specific to DeepVariant, we recommend that you post on a; community discussion forum such as [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/). ## License.

4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content provided contains commands for downloading and processing data files (e.g., .bed, .vcf.gz, .bai) from specific URLs. While it does not directly mention testing or fault detection, the nature of these commands suggests they are part of a data retrieval process that would be used in testing scenarios. Without explicit references to test design or execution, it's unclear if this is a direct example of testability. However, the commands themselves relate to handling data necessary for testing, which could be an indirect indication. Therefore, I'm leaning towards it being true but not entirely certain."

",False,"The content provided discusses technical details about data processing and analysis, specifically related to haplotype analysis using Hap.py software. It includes commands for running Docker containers, configurations for data input/output directories, and parameters for executing haplotype grouping. While this is relevant to computational processes in software engineering, it does not directly address aspects of testability such as creating or validating test cases, fault detection, or reducing complexity in testing. Instead, it focuses on the operational aspects of running analyses rather than the quality attribute of making the system more testable."

Content: eepVariant v0.9 release, we recommend; ""[Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md)"". For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced; [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md); in v1.1. ## Why am I seeing ""CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error"" while running on GPU?. We have been observing the following message while running on GPU since we moved; platform from slim to keras:. ```bash; 2023-10-20 22:21:03.818638: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```. We; have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So; you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. ## How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models?. 16GB.

",True,"The content provided in the context discusses various aspects related to the DeepVariant tool, including error messages during GPU usage and compatibility issues with different versions of models and platforms (e.g., moving from Slim to Keras). It also touches upon topics like GPU memory requirements and multi-GPU support. While some parts of the content are logs or documentation fragments, other sections provide information that is relevant to how the software functions, including validation through testing. For instance, it mentions that an initialization error on GPU does not affect inference, which implies that the functionality is still validated despite the error. Additionally, it discusses compatibility and feature updates, which can impact testability by ensuring that different versions of the software work together as expected. Therefore, this content aligns with the Testability quality attribute by addressing issues related to testing environments and system validation."

So, we are introducing two; flags to re-adjust the genotypes in regions that are considered to be haploid; for those samples.

After that the most-likely genotype is assigned to; the allele which excludes any heterozygous calls. For example, suppose we observe an alternate allele `ALT1` at a position that we; consider to be haploid. So the observed alleles at that position are:; `Candidates: {REF, ALT1}` The neural network generates likelihoods for the; genotypes for this candidate as such:. ```; Homozygous reference: likelihood(REF,REF); Heterozygous alternate: likelihood(REF,ALT1); Homozygous alternaate: likelihood(ALT1,ALT1); ```",test,MatchSource.DOCS,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/v1.6.1/docs/deepvariant-haploid-support.md:1357,testdata,1357,docs/deepvariant-haploid-support.md,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/v1.6.1/docs/deepvariant-haploid-support.md,1,['test'],['testdata'],"The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection.

",False,"The provided content discusses file formats (BAM and CRAM) supported by DeepVariant, detailing their sizes and runtime performance when processed using `make_examples`. It also mentions the inclusion of tools like samtools and bcftools starting from v1.2.0. This relates to how DeepVariant handles different data formats efficiently and effectively, which contributes to its testability by ensuring that it can process various input types correctly. The mention of processing time and file sizes may be relevant for testing procedures, but the content seems more focused on functionality rather than testing specifically. While it does touch upon performance aspects, which could relate to testing efficiency, the primary focus is on data handling and tool inclusion, not directly on testability in terms of validation or fault detection. Therefore, this content only partially relates to Testability and may be a false positive."

Content: pecifying `--model_type ONT_R104`, you'll be using a model that is best; suited for Oxford Nanopore R10.4.1 chemistry Simplex and Duplex reads. NOTE: If you want to run each of the steps separately, add `--dry_run=true` to; the command above to figure out what flags you need in each step. Based on the; different model types, different flags are needed in the `make_examples` step. `--intermediate_results_dir` flag is optional.

Content: d; [reference sequences in CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#REFERENCE_SEQUENCES). `htslib` also hosts a nice page; [benchmarking CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/CRAM.html) with information; on the effect of different CRAM options on file size and encoding/decoding; performance. Here are some basic file size and runtime numbers for running a single; `make_examples` job on a 30x whole genome sample in BAM and CRAM format. Filetype | Size (Gb) | Runtime (min); -------- | --------- | -------------; BAM | 66.99 | 79m47.37307s; CRAM | 37.85 | 96m53.477s; Ratio | 56.50% | 121.43%. * BAM file:; `gs://deepvariant/performance-testdata/HG002_NIST_150bp_downsampled_30x.bam`; * CRAM file:; `gs://deepvariant/performance-testdata/HG002_NIST_150bp_downsampled_30x.cram`. Runtime was measured on; [n1-standard-64](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#n1_machine_types); machines. ## Starting from v1.2.0, we include `samtools` and `bcftools`. Based on user feedback ([GitHub issue #414](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/414)),; we added samtools and bcftools in our Docker image:. ```bash; docker run google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" samtools; ```. and. ```bash; docker run google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" bcftools; ```. You can read more about samtools and bcftools here: http://www.htslib.org/doc/. ## Commands for requesting machines used in case studies. We report runtime in our case studies documentation. In order to make sure the; results we report are reproducible without too much variation, we provide the; commands we used here to show you what kind of machines we ran the case studies; on. This is NOT the fastest or cheapest configuration. ### Command for a CPU-only machine on Google Cloud Platform. We used a 64-core (vCPU) machine with 240GiB of memory and no GPU, on the Google; Cloud Platform. Specifying the CPU platform also allows us to report the runtime; more consistently. ```shell; gcloud compute instances create ""${USER}-cpu""
