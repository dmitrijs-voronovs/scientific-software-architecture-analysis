However, it's worth noting that `--skipQuant` does not usually shave that much time off of the run. Specifically, it only eliminates the quantification step, but not the alignment of all of the reads. On the other hand, library type detection chooses a library type after the first ~10,000 mapped reads. If you would like to use this flag for library type detection, I'd recommend something like the following. Feed your input to salmon using the `--skipQuant` option, but only fix it a small prefix of the read set (maybe the first 100,000 reads or so). This way, it will run quickly, not attempt to do quantification, and still provide you with an inferred library type. --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/138#issuecomment-585812231

It also had the same issue and therefore wasn't building correctly. I started the install again from ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ using the following: . cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/users/work/jake/bin/boost_1_64_0/ -DZLIB_LIBRARY=/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h .. . It seemed to work nicely and I got all the build files to propagate into the ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ directory.

After deleting the Cache.txt file I tried to build again at which point I noticed the following:; **WARNING: Target ""salmon"" requests linking to directory ""/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/"". Targets may link only to libraries. CMake is dropping the item.**; **WARNING: Target ""unitTests"" requests linking to directory ""/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/"". Targets may link only to libraries. CMake is dropping the item.**. So I actually went back a step and check my initial cmake command in the ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ directory. It also had the same issue and therefore wasn't building correctly. I started the install again from ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ using the following: . cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/users/work/jake/bin/boost_1_64_0/ -DZLIB_LIBRARY=/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h .. . It seemed to work nicely and I got all the build files to propagate into the ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ directory.

Currently, Salmon does not support mixed paired-end and single-end library types, so this is presumably what is causing the error (granted, the error message here could be considerably better). Practically, I'd be curious what the difference is between allowing this and simply running Salmon with the _non-quality-trimmed_ paired-end reads. Specifically, if Salmon is not able to map a pair concordantly, but it can map one of the ends of the read, then it will already do so. . However, in the case that there's a really compelling reason to want to quality trim the reads prior to quantification (and to include the reads such that the mate has been completely quality-trimmed away), we would be able to support this. It will require a bit of modification to allow different library types to be processed back to back and to contribute to the same quantification estimates. In this case, I imagine what we would want to do for the orphans is essentially what Salmon would do internally if it can't map the mate.

What I am saying is that this is *already* the way that Salmon handles such a case. That is, if you have a paired-end read, and one of the reads maps but the other doesn't (due to e.g., adapter contamination or just very low quality), then Salmon will consider the remaining (mapping) end of the read as representative of an entire fragment, and will resolve the fragment origin accordingly during optimization. Generally, not having both ends of a paired-end read leads to increased ambiguity, but this isn't a particularly big problem if it only happens to a generally small fraction of the reads. Further, since you cannot reliably infer the implied fragment length on a transcript from only a single-end read, such mappings will not contribute to the bias model. Again, however, as long as this doesn't happen to the vast majority of fragments, it should have only a negligible effect on quantification and bias correction.

The problem is that adapter contamination typically occures because the fragments were smaller than the sequence length we sequence into the adapters - and it can occur for a larger fraction of the reads (I've seen up to 50% of reads affected in the 3'end) making it non-negligible. That is why I suggested the extension in the first place. I think it makes a lot of sense to trim adapters away - both because they reduce the number of compatible reads - mostly because the failure to do so will result in an overestimation of the fragment length. .

If you want to proceed with transcript-level differential expression, _all transcripts are relevant_. That is, the relevant tools (e.g. DESeq2, limma-voom, Sleuth, etc.) will expect to be provided with _all_ quantified isoforms for each gene. They will then automatically apply their own filtering criteria to determine which transcripts to actually test for DE. . If you want to proceed with DE at the gene level (and hence want to aggregate the quantification information from the level of transcripts to genes), the easiest option is to use the [tximport](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) package. It can import all of the quantifications from multiple runs of Salmon, aggregate them to the gene level, and produce a count matrix that can then be used with traditional count-based gene-level DE tools. I would recommend the pipeline Salmon => tximport => DESeq2 for gene-level DE analysis.

Many RNA-seq experiments do end up with a mapping rate of 65-70%. One thing that might contribute to a lower mapping rate would be short reads relative to the minimum required exact match length (default of 31). If your reads are relatively short (after trimming, which it looks like you are doing here) --- say ~50bp, then one might try lowering the k value with which the index is built. This will allow more sensitive mapping. However, the other thing to try is simply to align one of these samples to the genome with a tool like STAR or HISAT2 and look at their mapping rate _to known features_. If it's similar, then the other reads could be accounted for by e.g. intron retention or even contamination. Finally, @vals has an [*excellent* series of blog posts](http://www.nxn.se/valent/2017/9/18/low-mapping-rate-5-human-dna-contamination) on investigating and addressing low mapping rates (albeit in single-cell data) that you might find useful.

I've fixed the issues related to the bwa files in the develop branch. I tested things out using an Alpine Linux docker image to re-create your environment. Unfortunately, there seems to be a bigger issue for building from source on Alpine Linux that is actually far beyond the scope of Salmon itself. Apparently, Alpine linux uses [musl])(https://www.musl-libc.org/), a non-standard libc replacement that is missing some of the calls used by [Intel's TBB](http://forum.alpinelinux.org/forum/general-discussion/compilation-tbb). I imagine this would affect quite a bit of scientific software on this distribution. I currently haven't found a work-around, but let me know if you're aware of anything.

The cmake system still forces downloading pufferfish during configure, which is forbidden in the ports system (like many other package managers). All downloads must occur during fetch phase and be verified using locally stored checksums. This would be easy to work around using GH_TUPLE, which downloads additional distfiles during fetch phase, except that fetchPufferfish.sh doesn't just extract the pufferfish dist, but has a long list of ""cp"" commands to copy pieces of it to ${INSTALL_DIR}.

There is a stochastic component to the algorithm, so one would not generally expect identical results between runs. However, differences should be small. The use of the `-g` flag should not affect transcript level inference, since the aggregation to gene-level abundances is done post-facto (i.e. after all transcript-level abundances have been estimated). Nonetheless, [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) is the recommended way to aggregate transcript-level inferences to the gene level.

So, the short answer is that on a _single sample_ the `-g` flag and `tximport` do something very similar. However, the real benefit of `tximport` is that it has access to _all_ of the samples when doing transcript to gene-level aggregation. . So, while Salmon with the `-g` flag will estimate the average expressed gene length in each sample, `tximport` will also have knowledge of how the average gene length varies across all samples.

https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/183#issuecomment-359218185:1364,Usability,clear,clearly,1364,"Hi @nskbe,. I apologize for the slow reply. Things have been super-busy over the ""break"" trying to get things done before the semester starts here. Let me see if I can answer your question satisfactorily. In retrospect, I think that the raw `lib_format_counts.json` file can be quite confusing, and I should definitely provide a more thorough description of it in the documentation (or include a tool to generate a more digestible report from it). Basically, the report records the number of each type of _mapping_ observed. By _mapping_, I mean the particular correspondence between a read and a transcript. A given read can have many mappings, and so can contribute multiple times to the entries of the `lib_format_counts.json` file. The reason changing the library type doesn't change the results of this file is because this file records how fragments _mapped_ to the reference, not necessarily how they were _assigned_ during quantification. So, for example, a read map map in both the forward `SF` and reverse complement `SR` orientations. If you pass the library type `-l SR` to Salmon, then the reverse complement mapping will be strongly preferred for assignment of the read to the forward mapping. However, before the read was probabilistically assigned to a transcript, both types of mappings were observed. From the report you have provided, you quite clearly have a `SR` library type. One other thing that I should note. As I mention above, Salmon will assign a higher probability to the preferred library type, but not, by default, a probability of 1. If you want to force Salmon to only assign reads that arise from mappings in the prescribed orientation, you should pass the flag `--incompatPrior 0.0`. This will tell Salmon that it should assign a probability of 0 to any read that maps to a transcript in a way that disagrees with the provided library type.

However, as I mention in issue #102, there is a _small_, inherent, non-determinism in the program, even if random seeds are all set identically. This is due to the streaming nature of the first phase of the algorithm (i.e., the online phase). Specifically, the initial, online abundance estimates, as well as the parameters of some of the experimental and bias models, can be affected by the order in which reads are observed / processed, which is asynchronous and non-deterministic. As I mention in #102, deviations are expected to be _very small_, and any differences encountered due to this are smaller than the inherent uncertainty in inference. I think that allowing to remove all controllable sources of non-determinism (e.g. random number generator seeds) is a great idea, and we should do it. However, removing small perturbations that are due to asynchronous processing of reads is a much larger task.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/185#issuecomment-358336866

This is an interesting observation. The most likely reason you are seeing this behavior is that the fast mapping algorithms are, in a sense, quite greedy in how they attempt to map reads. This can lead them to suffer with compared to more traditional alignment algorithms like Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM with respect to both sensitivity and specificity. Here, you are likely seeing a manifestation of the former. Specifically, greedy behavior can lead to spurious matches. Many of these spurious matches are filtered out when applying a consensus mechanism to the series of matches produced by a read; however, this can result in the read going unmapped. We have noticed this behavior where spurious matches can ""mask"" better overall mappings, and we have developed an algorithm to overcome these limitations (called selective-alignment). This is currently implemented in [this branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/rescue-orphan) of the Salmon repo (if you want to test it out and have trouble building, we can build you a linux executable). This algorithm explores more potential mappings and then applies a fast algorithm for filtering potentially poor ones. In our benchmarks, it exhibits sensitivity and specificity very close to Bowtie2 (which is among the best of the alignment-based methods we considered). Also, I will note that, though the speed and statistical optimization procedures used in fast transcript abundance estimation tools make them a potentially desirable choice for microbiomic / metagenomic abundance estimation, their indices are typically optimized for speed and not size. For small numbers of bacterial species this can be okay, but if one wishes to index large collections of species, the memory usage can become a problem. To this end, we have developed a new indexing scheme (software [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish), slightly out-of-date pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297

So, I'm not yet able to reproduce this. It seems the file you uploaded for your pre-built index is no longer available, so I couldn't try that out. I'd be happy to give it a try if you can put it up on dropbox or some such. Otherwise, I wonder if there could be some sort of binary compatibility issue. Did you build the index on the same machine you're quantifying on? The OSX I tested on is 10.13.1.

My first hypothesis is that the difference could be arising from differences in the annotation --- for salmon you are using reference cdna, and for STAR+RSEM you are mapping against the genome with, presumably, some gtf file used for annotation (I believe that what RSEM does internally is to run STAR with the proper flags to ""project"" mapped reads onto the transcriptome). Are these transcriptomes equivalent? For example, are there differences in annotated rRNAs, which can make a big difference depending on the prep protocol. The other question is the difference in the total assigned number of reads. What do you get when you add up the `NumReads` column from salmon versus the `expected_count` column from RSEM --- there could be some difference in terms of reads mapped to the genome but not properly annotated and, therefore, not contributing to quantification. Finally, you can always pass the BAM file generated by STAR+RSEM to salmon (in alignment mode) to see how that affects the total number of mapped reads. Though there is always the possibility that something unforeseen is causing these differences, they usually seem to wind up being due to something mundane but non-obvious.

What exactly is the difference here (i.e. where are those reads going in salmon)? STAR doesn't perform stranded alignment. You can trying using the `-l U` library flag for salmon to see if it's a strandedness issue.

I'm able to re-create the problem and am trying to debug it now. The reason you see this behavior in 0.10.1 but not in 0.8.1 is because in 0.10.1 the error model is enabled by default, while it is not in 0.8.1. If you run the newest salmon with `--noErrorModel` (the default in 0.8.1), your sample runs to completion. However, using the error model helps (which is why I made it the default), so I'm trying to debug what's happening there. I'll keep you posted. One more point worth mentioning. I noticed you are passing a coordinate sorted BAM file. For quantification with salmon, you really should not be passing a coordinate sorted BAM. This is because Salmon expects the alignments to appear in a random order, which is important for how the streaming stochastic variational algorithm learns the auxiliary parameters.

I actually think that making the barcode processing phase of alevin a bit more general sounds like an excellent idea. Right now, the barcode processing is parameterized by a class that describes the barcode layout etc. These are represented, basically, as C++ policy classes. However, having a custom policy (specified in e.g. a YAML file or some such) wouldn't be too difficult to do, and might make the barcode processing useful in a larger context. We'd be happy to help implement this and see if it works in your context. One question to resolve first, though (please chime in here @k3yavi) is what assumptions make sense for bar code correction in each datatype. That is, do we expect similar-ish numbers and distributions of barcodes, etc. so that our ""knee-in-the-curve"" heuristics still make sense?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395180151

Thanks again for the interest !!. re: *interleaved format* -- indeed an interleave format does makes sense and should be the default dumping format, but I believe since the default mode of 10x's `mkfastq` is to dump separate `FASTQ`, we should not use resources to create an interim interleaved format and then consume it downstream (since`FASTQ` itself is not very efficient), instead, in alevin we just consume the two separate `FASTQ` into our own interim data-structure to perform the downstream analysis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395195411

In the meantime, I also noticed something that gave me pause. Specifically, in your output, you have:. ```; ### [ mates1 ] => { /dev/fd/63 }; ### [ mates2 ] => { /dev/fd/62 }; ```. Which makes me think that you are using pipe / process substitution to feed the reads to alevin. While this works fine with normal salmon, it's not currently possible with alevin. This is because alevin goes through the barcode file once by itself, and then goes through both the barcode and read files in unison to assign reads to cells using the initial barcode mapping. Thus, the pipe can't be reset to read from the beginning again, which is a problem. Are you, in fact, using process substitution here? Alevin can read directly from gzipped fastq files, so that's not necessary. Could you see if you encounter the issue if you remove the process substitution (if you're using it)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/234#issuecomment-395843922

It failed at this command because of missing boost symbols in a link operation, my reading is that the command does not include anything to link boost libraries. So telling cmake where the libraries are, where the include files are, and that boost was found was not sufficient.

Extrapolating from the log, It indeed looks like a challenging dataset. In default settings Alevin pipeline starts with finding a knee in the curve (which itself is a non-trivial problem) and then use KDE w/ gaussian correction to adjust for the right probability. In your case it looks like knee is overshooting (if true number of CB is 300 ) but more troubling part for me is gaussian correction is coming out 0. Now based on your motivation for using Alevin, I can propose two solutions:. 1. If the motivation is to get gene-level count without worrying about the whitelisted CB prediction then the easiest way is to use external whitelist. Alevin can use external whitelist using flag `--whitelist` and would generate gene level counts for specified list of CB.; 2. If you need full end-to-end run of Alevin, then I propose using command line flag `--dumpFeatures` along with Alevin default. This flag tells Alevin to dump various features, the important one here would be a file named `frequency.txt`, what this file basically tells you is the frequency of all the observed CB in a order. From there we can manually select a knee in the frequency curve and use that as a whitelist. In terms of improving the task for improving the knee selection in Alevin, if you can share the `frequency.txt` file then I can look into what's causing the issue for gaussian correction or the knee selection itself.

You can get either Gibbs samples from the posterior, or bootstrap estimates. To get the former, you pass `--numGibbsSamples <nsamp>` to salmon, and to get the latter, you pass `--numBootstraps <nsamp>`. Either way, samples will be written to a binary, gzipped file in `aux_dir/bootstrap/ bootstraps.gz` (we decided to keep a uniform file name regardless of the sampling type, however the type of sampling performed can be derived from `aux_dir/meta_info.json`). Two things to point out here. First, the binary file format can be converted to TSV if you prefer using [this script](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/scripts/ConvertBootstrapsToTSV.py). Second, these are samples over the number of reads assigned to the transcripts (not the TPMs directly). However, you could easily convert samples over the number of reads to samples over the TPMs by applying the TPM formula (i.e. TPM_i = 10^6 * (num_reads_i / effective_length_i) / (sum_j (num_reads_j / effective_length_j))).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/246#issuecomment-401834462

While I completely understand that this is not the desired behavior, it is the expected behavior. That is, when collapsing duplicates during indexing, the invariant that is maintained is that all sequence-identical transcripts will be ""collapsed"" and a single representative maintained. In practice (i.e. in implementation), the transcript that is maintained is the first one encountered. In the short-term, your suggested solution is the best. That is you can simply remove the non-canonical transcripts from the input fasta file. Alternatively, you could re-order the entries in the file so that the canonical transcript occurs first. In the longer term, I'd be happy to implement a de-duplication procedure that is more aware of the semantics of the transcript names. However, I'd want to figure out how to do this that is agnostic to where the transcripts are coming from (i.e. that doesn't work only for Gencode, human etc., and that does something sensible when the transcripts are e.g. _de novo_ assembled contigs).

The issue with test 1 seems to be from CMake being unable to find the unit test to execute under certain configurations. I'll consider this a bug in the CMake file, and look into fixing it. The failure of tests 2 and 3 is more interesting, as one would definitely not expect this given that the program compiled without error. Does indexing fail only with `--type fmd`, or also with `--type quasi` (or no `--type` as that is the default)? Would it be possible to run the command under gdb and report the stack trace? That would be something like:. ```; $ gdb --args salmon index -t transcripts.fasta -i sample_salmon_fmd_index --type fmd; ```. and then, when you encounter the segfault issuing the back-trace `bt` command. This would give insight into where, exactly this is showing up. One issue I've seen before is when the resident installation of Boost is _not_ compiled with `--std=c++11` (or 14 or 17), since this leads to an incompatible ABI between salmon and the Boost library. If that's what's going on, it should be evident from the backtrace. Finally, while I'd want to figure out what's going on with this build from source, it would also be useful to know if you encounter the same behavior when installing via bioconda.

(1) The motivation behind asking users to use Bioconda to install the binary is to limit the number of variables we may encounter when someone is reporting a bug --- i.e. if there are fewer distribution channels there is less maintenance overhead. Nonetheless, as you can see, I've had to make the binary available anyway, because it was the only way some people could easily get the program. Therefore, I think I'll start attaching binaries to releases again. (2) Yes, though this functionality is not part of Salmon itself. I *highly* recommend the [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/) tool. MultiQC has a salmon module, which will parse all of the salmon log files in an experiment directory and produce a report. This report will contain the mapping percentages for all of the samples extracted from the salmon logs (and will color them nicely). It will also produce other QC information from the salmon runs.

This means that it will return quantification estimates for all of the sequence identical transcripts separately. A common scenario may be that it will split the abundances evenly, but this may not always be the case, depending on e.g. the initialization of the EM algorithm etc. The easiest way to try and compare the estimates as closely as possible would probably be to use the `duplicate_clusters.tsv` file produced by salmon to explicitly collapse (add up) the abundances of the duplicate transcripts from the RSEM quantifications before comparing.

However, a couple of comments before we try to work on this metric. Even though Alevin uses transcript based method to get the UMI count, it does not resolve the ambiguity at transcript level instead we only resolve collision at transcript level and report gene level counts (at least in current stable release of Alevin v11.2). Having said that the definition of sequence saturation you are suggesting:; > the fraction of duplicated reads from unique transcripts that are sequenced at least 2 times. My understanding is that the sequence saturation (at least in 10x based definition) is based on UMI not on reads.

So I was imagining it could be possible to take the gene quantifications; from (de)duplicated UMIs, gene quantifications from unique UMIs, using; them to have an idea of the amount/ratio of redundant information in the; sequencing data, producing a metric very similar to the seq sat from the; 10x definition.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/267#issuecomment-414331344

First you have to run Aleivn with the flag `--dumpFeatures` but since you have the file `filtered_cb_frequency.txt` I think you already have specified this flag in your run of the dataset. The relevant files you need for generating alignment rate would be following:. 1. *filtered_cb_frequency.txt*: A *tsv* file with the first column as the Cellular Barcode(CB) id and the second column has the frequency of the CB after sequence correction.; 2. *MappedUmi.txt*: A *tsv* file with the first column as the Cellular Barcode(CB) id and the second column has the number of reads confidently mapped to the provided reference transcriptome. Both the file should have same number of rows (i.e. CB), although the order can be different. To get the Alignment rate you might have to divide the value of each CB in the second file by the value in the first file i.e. the Number of mapped reads over total number of available reads for that CB. The second and more easier way is (although version bounded i.e. if you have latest version of Salmon (v11.2)), then if you run alevin with `--dumpFeatures` flag it will also generate a file called `featureDump.txt`. This file has multiple feature entries although the relevant one (the alignment rate) in case of yours would be the first one. Hope that helps.

So I'm trying to think about what issues _could_ be reasonably dealt with here. . 1) If the length of the sequence in the BAM header and the sequence provided in the FASTA file are different, this seems like a very difficult error to recover from since records can then contain alignments to bases about which we don't know. 2) If the same transcript appears multiple times in the input BAM header, but with different lengths, this also seems a difficult situation to allow. Exact duplicates are one thing, but I'm not sure if sequences ever appear with the same name but different lengths. If so, I'm thinking this would be a hard error. So, I think at least one situation we could reasonably deal with is that the input FASTA file contains multiple entries with the same name (and same length / sequence). In this case, we could retain only one of them, and document / log the fact that multiple identical entries were present in the input. Of course, there would still be an issue if we had a mismatch as with your example STAR input, where STAR concatenated all 3 occurences of an identical transcript.

This is caused primarily by salmon's desire to apply an error model (by default) to the CIGAR strings. For secondary alignments, as you note, minmap2 doesn't write the read string, and so when salmon is trying to score the alignments under the error model, it can't find the relevant characters in the read.

Extracting the CB/UMI from bcl or generalizing the input format for PE is indeed in our todo list. Specially with the introduction of combinatorial barcoding of single cells, as you said, the information might be in multiple files and has to be extracted right. It's definitely in our priority list and one would hope to support this in future.

Yes, you are right, it seems the problem is indeed in the whitelist `known_cb.txt`. However, I cannot seem to find out what exactly is going on with the file. When I wrote a python script to check the length of each cell barcode in `known_cb.txt`, _all_ of them are 16 bp long. This is the python script:. ```; $ cat print_length.py; with open('known_cb.txt') as fh:; for i in fh:; print(len(i)); ```. since each line has 16 bp barcode and a `\n` character, it outputs 17, which is expected. However, when I used `awk` to check the length, I expected `awk` to output 16, but it actually output 17:. ```; $ awk '{print length($0);}' known_cb.txt | head -2; 17; 17; ```. There might be some hidden characters that I missed. Any idea what's going?. Now, I have cleaned the `known_cb.txt`, and `alevin` runs without problem. For combinatorial indexing, good to known that it will be supported in future. I guess depending on assays, it needs to be a bit more flexible than the current options. The current options have only `--chromium` and `--dropseq` available. However, there are a few different combinatorial indexing assays. For `sci-RNA-seq`, the cell barcodes are within `I1.fastq`, `I2.fastq` and `R1.fastq`. Only `R2.fastq` is useful for gene quantification. For `sci-ATAC-seq`, the cell barcodes (this is just my educational guess) are within `I1.fastq` and `I2.fastq`, and both `R1.fastq` and `R2.fastq` contain useful information from the genome. For other plate-based method, there will be well barcodes and plate barcodes, which could be located in any of those 4 fastq files depends on the design. The cell barcodes will be a combination of well barcodes and plate barcodes. Thank you very much for the help.

Yes, you are right, it seems the problem is indeed in the whitelist `known_cb.txt`. However, I cannot seem to find out what exactly is going on with the file. When I wrote a python script to check the length of each cell barcode in `known_cb.txt`, _all_ of them are 16 bp long. This is the python script:. ```; $ cat print_length.py; with open('known_cb.txt') as fh:; for i in fh:; print(len(i)); ```. since each line has 16 bp barcode and a `\n` character, it outputs 17, which is expected. However, when I used `awk` to check the length, I expected `awk` to output 16, but it actually output 17:. ```; $ awk '{print length($0);}' known_cb.txt | head -2; 17; 17; ```. There might be some hidden characters that I missed. Any idea what's going?. Now, I have cleaned the `known_cb.txt`, and `alevin` runs without problem. For combinatorial indexing, good to known that it will be supported in future. I guess depending on assays, it needs to be a bit more flexible than the current options. The current options have only `--chromium` and `--dropseq` available. However, there are a few different combinatorial indexing assays. For `sci-RNA-seq`, the cell barcodes are within `I1.fastq`, `I2.fastq` and `R1.fastq`. Only `R2.fastq` is useful for gene quantification. For `sci-ATAC-seq`, the cell barcodes (this is just my educational guess) are within `I1.fastq` and `I2.fastq`, and both `R1.fastq` and `R2.fastq` contain useful information from the genome. For other plate-based method, there will be well barcodes and plate barcodes, which could be located in any of those 4 fastq files depends on the design. The cell barcodes will be a combination of well barcodes and plate barcodes. Thank you very much for the help.

In 10x protocols we generally expects that the read follow the `ISR` standard but it looks like some 5% of the reads are not following this property and that's what Alevin is complaining.

Looking at the older annotation, it seems that the transcripts have slightly different lengths:. ```; >ENST00000617214 ensembl:known chromosome:GRCh38:CHR_HSCHR8_8_CTG1:1973878:2006943:1 gene:ENSG00000273645 gene_biotype:protein_coding transcript_biotype:protein_coding. >ENST00000320248 ensembl_havana_transcript:known chromosome:GRCh38:8:1973878:2006936:1 gene:ENSG00000176595 gene_biotype:protein_coding transcript_biotype:protein_coding; ```. I don't know if that's the _only_ difference between them or if they are spliced differently in the middle etc. Both salmon and seqkit only check for *exact* sequence duplication. If you wanted to try to dig more into what might be causing the differences you might consider `<salmon_quant_folder>/aux_info/ambig_info.tsv` which lists the transcripts in the same order as `quant.sf` but gives for each the number of uniquely mapping reads and the total number of potential reads. You could see if the unique evidence for the txps changes between conditions. However, given that Ensembl has changed their mind about these guys, maybe that's not a rabbit hole worth going down.

It does sound really interesting. If I may, I'd like to ask a couple of questions before going deeper into your questions. ; * When you say you try subsampling the `Fastq`, did you sample randomly across the full `Fastq` or chose the top X reads. One can imagine that if you simply, sample just the top X reads and the `Fastq` has not been generated in random order then a certain subset of CB will get all the reads and you'd still observe the coverage bias in them. I'd suggest can you please try subsampling randomly across the full `Fastq` if you haven't tried that already.; * `re: subsampling coefficient:` If you are looking for per-CB level mapping rate for your sample that would be very easy to calculate, although getting one number for the full sample might be little tricky since the mapping rate might have large variance across the sample, but it would be an interesting plot to generate, do let us know how it looks in your case.; If you run Alevin with `--dumpFeatures` flag, alevin will generate a file `featureDump.txt`, whose first column will be the per CB level mapping rate i.e. `#mapped reads/#raw reads`.

So lots of reads, but less much counts after quantification (and summarization at the UMI level). So if one sequences deeply any sample, it would affect in a very uneven way both the cells and genes, depending on the level of transcriptional activity of the cell (cycling...) and the level of expression of a given gene. Then subsampling the fastq files before any quantification would be more fair, what do you think?.

Just a heads up I am not very experienced in `R` and I may be doing something wrong but can you please forward your `gencode.primary_assemblyv29.tsv` because it seems the file generate after following your R code to generate txp to gene map does not seem to be right. It looks like somehow `as.data.frame(txdf$TXNAME, txdf$GENEID)`is not doing the expected thing i.e. it's dumping only the gene names, at least in my testing. One alternative would be to use bioawk script from [here](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2018/setting-up-resources/) or may be use `do.call(rbind, Map(data.frame, A=txdf$TXNAME, B=txdf$GENEID))` in R, I am not sure about the latter though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/326#issuecomment-443712972

The problem is the _full_ name in the reference fasta and the GTF does not align, only a prefix from the fasta does. Another thing I noticed in the logs you forwarded is that the number of CB detected by our knee heuristic seems to be undershooting.
