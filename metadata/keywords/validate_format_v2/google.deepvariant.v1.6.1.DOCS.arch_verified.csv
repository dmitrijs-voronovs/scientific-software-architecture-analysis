In order to efficiently perform variant calling, DeepVariant partitions the; genome into chunks (set by `--partition_size`), and will read in a max number of; reads into each partition (set by `--max_reads_per_partition`). By default,; `--partition_size` is set to 1000 and `--max_reads_per_partition` is set to; 1500. The `AD` and `DP` values are based on the read depths constrained by; `--max_reads_per_partition`. For example, if you have a depth of 2000x at a given site, DeepVariant will; subsample 1500 reads, and `DP` or `AD` will be capped at 1500. If you want to; calculate the true `AD` and `DP` values at high-depth regions, you can set; `--max_reads_per_partition=0` to calculate `AD` and `DP` using all reads.

 your location and regional; hardware availability. NOTE: Not all zones are equipped with GPUs, so if you want to use GPUs for your; project, please take note of the availability listing; [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/). To verify that the installation and authentication succeeded, run. ```shell; gcloud auth list; ```. and verify that your account email address is printed. ## Starting a Compute Engine instance. A simple way to access compute on GCP is Google Compute Engine. Compute Engine; instances can be sized to meet computational and storage needs for your project. Before we get started, [ensure you have adequate quota; provisioned](https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas) so that you can get all; the CPUs/GPUs that you need. To start with, you might want to request quota for; 64 CPUs and 2 GPUs in your zone. DeepVariant can make use of multiple CPU cores and (currently, a single) GPU; device. For this ""quick start"" guide, let's allocate an 8-core non-preemptible; instance in your default zone with a single GPU, running Ubuntu 20.04, with a; disk of reasonable size for modest work with genomic data. From our local; command line, we do:. ```shell; gcloud beta compute instances create ""${USER}-deepvariant-quickstart"" \; --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \; --image-family ubuntu-2004-lts --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \; --machine-type n1-standard-8 \; --boot-disk-size=200GB \; --zone us-west1-b \; --accelerator type=nvidia-tesla-k80,count=1 --maintenance-policy TERMINATE --restart-on-failure; ```. NOTE: To create an instance *without GPU*, simply omit the last line from the; command. Check that the instance has been created and started:. ```shell; gcloud compute instances list; ```. which should produce output like:. ```; NAME ZONE MACHINE_TYPE PREEMPTIBLE INTERNAL_IP EXTERNAL_IP STATUS; [USER]-deepvariant-quickstart us-west1-b n1-standard-8 10.138.0.4 35.185.203.59 RUNNING; ```.

Energy Efficiency,"is; important to first determine whether a candidate variant was proposed by; DeepVariant. A potential variant requires at least 2 reads to support a variant; and a minimum fraction of reads supporting the variant (0.12 for SNPs and PacBio; Indels, 0.06 for Illumina Indels). All sites that have been generated as; candidates are written in the VCF file, so if you do not see a row in the VCF; file for the variant in question, it means that a candidate was not made.; However, within these sites certain possible alleles may have been pruned in; reporting. To see all alleles, you may add: `--debug_output_all_candidates=ALT`; in the postprocess_variants step. To increase the sensitivity of DeepVariant to these sites, you may add the; following parameters, here shown with their defaults:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""vsc_min_count_snps=2,vsc_min_fraction_snps=0.12,vsc_min_count_indels=2,vsc_min_fraction_indels=0.06""; ```. It is sometimes also the case that realignment of the reads within DeepVariant; changes or reduces the evidence supporting the variant. To check for this, try; using the `--norealign_reads` flag to turn off realignment temporarily. Note; that we don't recommend turning off the realigner for Illumina data in general; cases because the realigner improves accuracy overall. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. See the ""What is the realigner and how does it work?"" section; for instructions. **Missing variants where a candidate is generated:**. If a candidate is made, but is called as reference (either 0/0 or ./.) it means; that the neural network processed the genomic region, but based on all of its; learned experience from training data, it decided the highest probability for; the position was as non-variant.

**Content to evaluate:**  
is; important to first determine whether a candidate variant was proposed by; DeepVariant. A potential variant requires at least 2 reads to support a variant; and a minimum fraction of reads supporting the variant (0.12 for SNPs and PacBio; Indels, 0.06 for Illumina Indels). All sites that have been generated as; candidates are written in the VCF file, so if you do not see a row in the VCF; file for the variant in question, it means that a candidate was not made.; However, within these sites certain possible alleles may have been pruned in; reporting. To see all alleles, you may add: `--debug_output_all_candidates=ALT`; in the postprocess_variants step. To increase the sensitivity of DeepVariant to these sites, you may add the; following parameters, here shown with their defaults:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""vsc_min_count_snps=2,vsc_min_fraction_snps=0.12,vsc_min_count_indels=2,vsc_min_fraction_indels=0.06""; ```. It is sometimes also the case that realignment of the reads within DeepVariant; changes or reduces the evidence supporting the variant. To check for this, try; using the `--norealign_reads` flag to turn off realignment temporarily. Note; that we don't recommend turning off the realigner for Illumina data in general; cases because the realigner improves accuracy overall. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. See the ""What is the realigner and how does it work?"" section; for instructions. **Missing variants where a candidate is generated:**. If a candidate is made, but is called as reference (either 0/0 or ./.) it means; that the neural network processed the genomic region, but based on all of its; learned experience from training data, it decided the highest probability for; the position was as non-variant. Some of the reasons that DeepVariant may; suspect a false positive are: strand-bias in reads, low mapping quality in; reads, low base quality in reads, and overall low coverage. In additi

Energy Efficiency,"nally, each read is then realigned to its most likely; > haplotype. This procedure updates both the position and the CIGAR string for; > each read. Local realignment is not performed for long reads (PacBio, and other similar; technologies). The realigner step can optionally be switched off using; `--norealign_reads`. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. This can be done by passing the following parameters:; `--make_examples_extra_args=""emit_realigned_reads=true,realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads""`. Note that this is meant for debugging and produces a bam file for every; candidate variant, which can result in millions of tiny bam files, so when using; this, narrow down the DeepVariant run using `--regions` to just the variants you; want to inspect more closely. ## How are `AD` and `DP` values calculated?. In order to efficiently perform variant calling, DeepVariant partitions the; genome into chunks (set by `--partition_size`), and will read in a max number of; reads into each partition (set by `--max_reads_per_partition`). By default,; `--partition_size` is set to 1000 and `--max_reads_per_partition` is set to; 1500. The `AD` and `DP` values are based on the read depths constrained by; `--max_reads_per_partition`. For example, if you have a depth of 2000x at a given site, DeepVariant will; subsample 1500 reads, and `DP` or `AD` will be capped at 1500. If you want to; calculate the true `AD` and `DP` values at high-depth regions, you can set; `--max_reads_per_partition=0` to calculate `AD` and `DP` using all reads. In; practice, capping reads per partition reduces runtimes with little/no impact on; accuracy. ## Missing variant calls near the edge of a contig.

Based on a small number of experiments, currently the most efficient; configuration for `call_variants` on a GPU instance is 4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU.; Compared to our setting in the [whole genome case study], we noticed a 2.5x; speedup on the call_variants step using a single P100 GPU and 8 CPUs. Note that; currently `call_variants` can only use one GPU at most. So it doesn't improve; the speed if you get a multiple-GPU machine. ### postprocess_variants. `postprocess_variants` reads all of the output TFRecord files from; `call_variants`, sorts them, combines multi-allelic records, and writes out a; VCF file. When [gVCF output](deepvariant-gvcf-support.md) is requested, it also; outputs a gVCF file which merges the VCF with the non-variant sites. Because `postprocess_variants` combines and sorts the output of `call_variants`,; it needs to see all of the outputs from `call_variants` for a single sample to; merge into a final VCF. `postprocess_varia

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepVariant in one command. Starting from the 0.8 release, we introduced one convenient command that will; run through all 3 steps that are required to go from a BAM file to the VCF/gVCF; output files. You can still read about the r0.7 approach in; [Quick Start in r0.7]. If you want to compile the DeepVariant binaries for yourself, we also have a; [Dockerfile] that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the; [docker build] documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start running, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. An aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its corresponding index file; (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a sequencing instrument,; using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; DATA_HTTP_DIR=""https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/quickstart-testdata"". mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam.bai; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.bed; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz; wget -P ${INPUT_D

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

 test data in a bucket on Google Cloud; Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data through the; corresponding public URLs from these data. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepVariant in one command. Starting from the 0.8 release, we introduced one convenient command that will; run through all 3 steps that are required to go from a BAM file to the VCF/gVCF; output files. You can still read about the r0.7 approach in; [Quick Start in r0.7]. If you want to compile the DeepVariant binaries for yourself, we also have a; [Dockerfile] that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the; [docker build] documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start running, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. An aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its corresponding index file; (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a sequencing instrument,; using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; DATA_HTTP_DIR=""https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/quickstart-testdata"". mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; wget -P ${INPUT_DIR} ""${DATA_HTTP_DIR}""/NA12878_S1.chr20

Once it starts, you can see many metrics, including accuracy, speed, etc. You; will need to wait for `train` to run for a while before the plots will appear. ### Test the model. Now that we have performed training, we can test the performance of the new; model using our holdout dataset (chr20). The following one-step command can be used to call DeepVariant and run our newly; trained model:. ```bash; sudo docker run --gpus all \; -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \; ""${DOCKER_IMAGE}-gpu"" \; run_deepvariant \; --model_type WGS \; --customized_model ""${BEST_CHECKPOINT}"" \; --ref ""${REF}"" \; --reads ""${BAM_CHR20}"" \; --regions ""chr20"" \; --output_vcf ""${OUTPUT_DIR}/test_set.vcf.gz"" \; --num_shards=${N_SHARDS}; ```. In v1.4.0, by using `--model_type WGS`, `run_deepvariant` will automatically add; `insert_size` as an extra channel in the `make_examples` step. So we don't need; to add it in `--make_examples_extra_args`. When the `call_variants` step is run, you might see messages like:. ```; E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros.

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures.

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: The content only consists of logs and no other text.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``.

# DeepVariant RNA-seq Case Study. This case study will demonstrate how to run DeepVariant using the RNA-seq model,; and evaluate the result using `hap.py`. ## Overview. ### Tools. We will use the following tools:. * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Used to run DeepVariant.; * [mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth) - For calculating coverage.; * [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io) - Used to intersect bedfiles.; * [hap.py](https://github.com/illumina/hap.py) - Used to evaluate the results.; We will use Docker to run `hap.py`. ### Data. We will use these data in our analysis. Files will be downloaded in subsequent; steps. * HG005 RNA-seq BAM; * Model Checkpoint Files; * GRCh38 Reference + Index; * CDS bedfile (chr20 only); * GIAB benchmark data. ## Prepare Data. ### Setup directories. Lets first create directories to organize files. ```bash; mkdir -p data benchmark reference model output happy; ```. ### Download the GRCh38 Reference. We will be using GRCh38 for this case study. ```bash; FTPDIR=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids. curl ${FTPDIR}/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz | gunzip > reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta; curl ${FTPDIR}/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.fai > reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta.fai; ```. ### Download Genome in a Bottle Benchmarks. We will benchmark our variant calls against v4.2.1 of the Genome in a Bottle; small variant benchmarks for HG005. We will also restrict analysis to CDS; regions on chromosome 20 to make this demonstration quicker. The benchmarks consist of a bedfile containing confident regions, a VCF of; 'true' variants, and a VCF index. ```bash; FTPDIR=ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/ChineseTrio/HG005_NA24631_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38. curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed; curl -L ${FTPDIR}

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

To get started using DeepVariant on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you first need; to set up an account and a project to contain your cloud resources. * If you do not have an account yet, you should create one at; [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com). You should then [enable; billing for your; account](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6288653?hl=en) but note; that if your account is new, [you receive $300 of free; credit](https://cloud.google.com/free/). Once your cloud account is set up,; you should be able to log in to the [Cloud; Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) to view or administer your cloud; resources. * From the Cloud Console, [set up a; project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects); to house all of the cloud resources (storage, compute, services) that you; will associate with your use of DeepVariant. For example, if your; organization is AcmeCorp, you might call your project; `acmecorp-deepvariant`. * Finally, please visit the [""Compute Engine"" page on Cloud; Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute). You don't need to create; Compute Engine instances at this time, but simply visiting this page will; initialize your compute engine ""service account"" so that we can authorize; it.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

The presence of links to case studies and specific data formats (e.g., BAM, VCF, GVCF) suggests that it's intended for an audience familiar with bioinformatics tools and processes. There are no clear signs of non-technical content or promotional material; instead, it seems focused on providing step-by-step instructions for running the tool. Therefore, this content is likely to be considered technical documentation rather than general promotional or consumer-facing material."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

This; [article](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/6308/evaluating-the-quality-of-a-variant-callset); on the GATK forums has a good discussion of how to interpret the ratio. These; include all biallelic SNPs, excluding RefCalls. ### Biallelic indel size distribution. The sizes of all biallelic insertions and deletions are shown as histograms. The; top and bottom plots show the same data, just on a linear scale on top and on a; log scale on the bottom. RefCalls and multi-allelic variants are not included. ## Examples. ### WGS case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of WGS HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/WGS_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png). ### WES case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of WES HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/WES_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png). ### PacBio case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of PacBio HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/PacBio_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png).

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: The content only consists of logs and no other text.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

### Example 6
**Content:** is relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

We will benchmark our variant calls against v4.2.1 of the Genome in a Bottle; small variant benchmarks for HG005. We will also restrict analysis to CDS; regions on chromosome 20 to make this demonstration quicker. The benchmarks consist of a bedfile containing confident regions, a VCF of; 'true' variants, and a VCF index. ```bash; FTPDIR=ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/ChineseTrio/HG005_NA24631_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38. curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed; curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz; curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz.tbi > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz.tbi; ```. ### Download and extract a CDS bedfile. Next, we will download a [gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) gff3; annotation and extract a bed file of chr20 CDS regions. ```bash; curl -L https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_41/gencode.v41.basic.annotation.gff3.gz > dat

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?
