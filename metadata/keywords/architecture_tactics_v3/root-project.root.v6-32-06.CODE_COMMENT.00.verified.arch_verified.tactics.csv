",Testability,Control and Observe System State,Sandbox,Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.,"The provided text is part of a code comment and appears to be related to debugging or testing in a programming environment. The mention of 'decode error' suggests that the code is dealing with binary data processing, possibly involving encryption or decoding mechanisms. The advice about adding '-S' or '-disable-output' likely refers to specific compiler or tool options that control output generation, which could be used for testing purposes. This aligns with the concept of a Sandbox tactic, where experimental or potentially unstable code can be executed in an isolated environment to prevent widespread impact on the system."

""/* DWARF EH functions; currently not available on Darwin/ARM */""
",Security,Resist Attacks,Change Default Settings,Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.,"The comment indicates that some Dwarf Extended Hardware (DEH) functions are unavailable on Darwin/ARM systems. By default, such settings might allow DEH functions to be enabled or utilized. To enhance security and prevent potential exploit vectors related to DEH functions, it's advisable to change the default settings to disable these features unless absolutely necessary for system operation. This approach ensures that potentially insecure functionalities remain off by default, reducing the attack surface."
