https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14168#issuecomment-1937459344:1435,Testability,test,tested,1435," a 35K cohort. The VCF format of chr1 is 2.4T.; > ; > Heh. So, yes, ""project"" VCFs grow super-linearly in the number of samples. I (and others) are currently pushing very hard for the VCF spec to support two sparse representations: ""local alleles"" ([samtools/hts-specs#434](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/434)) and ""reference blocks"" ([samtools/hts-specs#435](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/435)). When using these two sparse representations, you should be able to store 35,000 whole genomes in ~10TiB of GZIP-compressed VCF.; > ; > What is your calling pipeline? Do you generate GVCFs? If yes, I strongly recommend you use the [VDS Combiner](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/vds/hail.vds.combiner.VariantDatasetCombiner.html#hail.vds.combiner.VariantDatasetCombiner) to produce a [VDS](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/vds/index.html). You can read more details in [this recent preprint we wrote](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.09.574205v1.full.pdf), but a VDS of 35,000 whole genomes should be a few terabytes. I'd guess 4 TiB, but it depends on your reference block granularity. I strongly recommend using size 10 GQ buckets. Looks like VDS is a better solution than HailMatrix. However, we got the joint call result as vcf alreay. Can VDS Combiner read joint call VCF and then save it as VDS format? I cannot find any example to transfer VCF to VDS. Thanks. > ; > > I don't know the Kryo JAR. I tested on both docker images hailgenetics/hail:0.2.126-py3.11 and hailgenetics/hail:0.2.127-py3.11.; > ; > Those should use Kryo 4.0.2. OK. My conclusion is that Kryo still has a bug preventing the serialization of very large objects. This becomes a limitation in Hail: we cannot support PLINK files with tens of millions of variants. Our community is largely transitioning to GVCFs and VDS, so I doubt we'll improve our PLINK1 importer to support such large PLINK1 files. That said, PRs are always welcome if loading such large PLINK1 files is a hard requirement for you all.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14168#issuecomment-1937459344

(This is an https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13481.) I wanted to get some advice about the best way to do this. I think ideally, the example would have a binary phenotype, an allele to test for association, and some stratifying variable. I tried to search through the existing code to find suitable example matrix tables in the docstrings, but I didn't find anything promising. I would appreciate help here. The code that sets up the doctest environment is [here](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/8a0e8e3375f1fc11efb5a443a350a8b4e8a24950/hail/python/hail/conftest.py#L55).

While fine for traditional file systems, this is not a good fit for object stores like GCS and S3.

Then the paper computes a $p \times n$ matrix $W$ called the **SNP weight matrix**:. $$W \coloneqq X^T U.$$. Suppose that there are $n_r$ individuals in the related set and let $Y$ be the $n_r \times p$ standardized genotype matrix for the related individuals. The paper computes the principal components associated with the related samples with. $$ \frac{1}{p} Y W (\Sigma^2)^{-1}.$$. ### Simplifications. The first simplification that I noticed is that we can do away with the $\frac{1}{p}$ terms. Because $\Psi$ is scaled by $p^{-1}$, the inverse of the eigenvalues, $(\Sigma^2)^{-1}$ is scaled by $p$, which cancels out the $1/p$ term in the calculation of the principal components for the related individuals. From here on, let us redefine $\Sigma^2$ as the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (not $\frac{1}{p} XX^T$). Next, by examining the relationship between singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition ([Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Relation_to_eigenvalue_decomposition)), I realized that it is not necessary to compute $\Psi$. Instead, we can get $U$ and $\Sigma$ from the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T,$$. where $V$ is a $p \times p$ basis of the new PCA coordinate space. Then while investigating the meaning of $W$, I realized that $W = X^T U = V \Sigma^T U^T U = V \Sigma^T$. Taking these simplifications into account, I realized that the paper is, in essence, computing $Y V$ to get the predicted scores associated with the related individuals. (Technically, I think that the paper is computing $Y V \Sigma^{-1}$. I am not sure why they scale the columns by the reciprocal of the eigenvalues here.). ### Simplified Approach. As I understand it, $V$ is a change-of-basis matrix from the original coordinates to the PCA scores. Letting $G$ denote the full standardized genotype matrix of all the individuals, I think we can just return $GV$, where $V$ is defined by the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T.$$",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14326#issuecomment-1962279184

Suppose that there are $n_r$ individuals in the related set and let $Y$ be the $n_r \times p$ standardized genotype matrix for the related individuals. The paper computes the principal components associated with the related samples with. $$ \frac{1}{p} Y W (\Sigma^2)^{-1}.$$. ### Simplifications. The first simplification that I noticed is that we can do away with the $\frac{1}{p}$ terms. Because $\Psi$ is scaled by $p^{-1}$, the inverse of the eigenvalues, $(\Sigma^2)^{-1}$ is scaled by $p$, which cancels out the $1/p$ term in the calculation of the principal components for the related individuals. From here on, let us redefine $\Sigma^2$ as the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (not $\frac{1}{p} XX^T$). Next, by examining the relationship between singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition ([Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Relation_to_eigenvalue_decomposition)), I realized that it is not necessary to compute $\Psi$. Instead, we can get $U$ and $\Sigma$ from the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T,$$. where $V$ is a $p \times p$ basis of the new PCA coordinate space. Then while investigating the meaning of $W$, I realized that $W = X^T U = V \Sigma^T U^T U = V \Sigma^T$.

Hopefully I can shed some light and address all your concerns. I think the assertion on Java 8 and 11 was an overly defensive precaution put in place some time ago, as hail uses some unsafe JVM APIs that have been deprecated for a while. But as you noted, the world goes on in Java 17 and I don't see a reason Hail shouldn't be compatible. Since most of our closest users use Hail on GCP Dataproc, we generally keep in lock-step with their platform which is unfortunately still on Java 11 so that is what we test against and officially support. Nevertheless, we should remove the restriction and add some light validation in CI against Java 17 and advertise it as unofficially supported until such a time that Dataproc moves to Java 17. Hopefully Spark 3.6 will force their hand. The release process for 0.2.129 is already underway but expect this to be resolved in 0.2.130. Thanks for your suggestions regarding bundling the JRE and the GC options, we'll definitely consider them. Regarding the `module-info.class` nonsense, my apologies. That just seems like a bug we should fix. I will create a separate tracking issue for that but I'm not yet sure where that will get prioritized. If it is more than an annoyance for you, please let us know. Regarding conda-forge, I don't think we currently have the bandwidth or demand (that we know of) to add more distribution systems. Again, this is something where hearing from the community is the best way to figure out how to direct our efforts. Hopefully this addresses your concerns.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14513#issuecomment-2092036876:601,Availability,ping,pinging,601,"Hi @mgeaghan, it looks like in this [change from 14 Feb](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/commit/6eacd66b3979bf27982b4d15b5f17c60474148cb) data for US, UK and Europe was moved to regional buckets, however it appears that the Australian data was not moved. At the moment `gs://hail-australia-southeast1-vep` does not exist, yet `gs://hail-aus-sydney-vep` DOES exist. You see the opposite pattern if you try UK, US or EU equivalents. @danking - is this a reasonable explanation? Are you able to move the Australian data, or is there someone else (or a different forum) that we should ask for this?. also pinging @patrick-schultz and @chrisvittal as you both were cc'd in the change referred to above :)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14513#issuecomment-2092036876

I was initially confused by `estimate-current.sql`; I thought it was a system-generated file to track the latest batch DDLs after a schema update, rather than a file that is manually updated.

In other organizations I've worked with, we maintained schema changes in a separate folder, identified by release versions (e.g., semver) and the DLLs are ordered by sequence number.

It's a little scary. @ehigham Thanks for your comments above. I’ve added the triggers and stored procedures referencing the `job_groups_cancelled` table in `rename-job-groups-cancelled-column.sql`. I was initially confused by `estimate-current.sql`; I thought it was a system-generated file to track the latest batch DDLs after a schema update, rather than a file that is manually updated. After reading this [thread](https://hail.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/300487-Hail-Batch-Dev/topic/mysqldump), I completely agree with your point. In other organizations I've worked with, we maintained schema changes in a separate folder, identified by release versions (e.g., semver) and the DLLs are ordered by sequence number. This way, we had a clear history of DDLs and the order they were applied, eliminating the need for files like `estimate-current.sql`. I just have one question: Do we need to manually update `estimate-current.sql` with the schema changes from `rename-job-groups-cancelled-column.sql`?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14672#issuecomment-2340993612
