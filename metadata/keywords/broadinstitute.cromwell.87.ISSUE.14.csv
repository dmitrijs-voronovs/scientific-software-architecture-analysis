That worked for Rawls because Rawls has relatively few actually unique metrics, and the metrics that it does have are extremely stable--no one is going to change them--so we literally hardcode the exact glob matching and regex patterns. With the number of metric Cromwell has, that raw hardcoding approach would get unmaintainable very, very quickly. My idea was to instead have metric names effectively be the following:. ```scala; type InstrumentationPath = NonEmptyList[String | (String, String)]",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681
https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681:3611,Integrability,interface,interface,3611,"entationPath); ```. Parts of a metric name expected to vary frequently could be stored as a key-value pair in the same list, and StatsD and Prometheus could simply handle it differently: StatsD could ignore the key and use the value to get the exact metric name as before, while Prometheus could assemble the name from just the strings and pass the key-value pairs as the labels. Unfortunately, union types are a Scala 3 thing. In Scala 2 we get `Either`, a manually-boxed type. :((((. So I did this:. ```scala; private type LowVariantPart = String; private type HighVariantPart = (String, String); private type InternalPath = NonEmptyList[Either[LowVariantPart, HighVariantPart]]. implicit class InstrumentationPath (val internalPath: InternalPath) { ... }; object InstrumentationPath { ... }. CromwellBucket(prefix: List[String], path: InstrumentationPath); ```. The implicit class provides a similar conceptual interface to the NonEmptyList, except it handles the necessary boxing (it also the includes some convenience methods that were already on a `implicit class EnhancedStatsDPath(val path: InstrumentationPath) extends AnyVal`).

When the metrics are actually sent to StatsD, the strings are joined with periods and sent off. I spent several days trying to figure out a way to reliably parse labels out from these names, and I couldn't figure it out. There's two key pieces of info known at the time the `NonEmptyList[String]` is assembled that are not recorded:; - When a particular string being added to the list is expected to vary frequently (and thus needs to be a label); - What that string means (labels are key-value pairs and we're usu",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681

That worked for Rawls because Rawls has relatively few actually unique metrics, and the metrics that it does have are extremely stable--no one is going to change them--so we literally hardcode the exact glob matching and regex patterns. With the number of metric Cromwell has, that raw hardcoding approach would get unmaintainable very, very quickly. My idea was to instead have metric names effectively be the following:. ```scala; type InstrumentationPath = NonEmptyList[String | (String, String)]. CromwellBucket(prefix: List[String], path: InstrumentationPath); ```. Parts of a metric name expected to vary frequently could be stored as a key-value pair in the same list, and StatsD and Prometheus could simply handle it differently: StatsD could ignore the key and use the value to get the exact metric name as before, while Prometheus could assemble the name from just the strings and pass the key-value pairs as the labels. Unfortunately, union types are a Scala 3 thing. In Scala 2 we get `Either`, a manually-boxed type. :((((. So I did this:. ```scala; private type LowVariantPart = String; private type HighVariantPart = (String, String); private type InternalPath = NonEmptyList[Either[LowVariantPart, HighVariantPart]]. implicit class InstrumentationPath (val internalPath: InternalPath) { ... }; object InstrumentationPath { ... }. CromwellBucket(prefix: List[String], path: InstrumentationPath); ```. The implicit class provides a similar conceptual interface to the NonEmptyList, except it handles the necessary boxing (it also the includes some convenience methods that were already on a `implicit class EnhancedStatsDPath(val path: InstrumentationPath) extends AnyVal`). The object effectively provides constructors to handle the no",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6716:538,Availability,error,error,538,"Cromwell Version: 77. Hi Guys,. Im not sure if this is a bug but I recently noticed this behaviour. Im trying to write a task that registers task S3 outputs at the end of a workflow in a third-party system and copy it to another S3 bucket. This task itself does not generate any files locally but at the end of its execution I expect a new S3 object to appear in the destination bucket. The inputs and outputs are marshalled using a struct with a ""File"" variable for the S3 path of the objects. After the task executes Cromwell throws an error scala.MatchError - it recognises that the output is a `cromwell.filesystems.s3.S3Path` but dosn't appear to know what to do with it. Im wondering if it is because the ""file"" is created outside of the workflow workspace?. My work around is to use the `String` type in place of `File` type for ""path"" and cast back to `File` later in the workflow but this feels inelegant.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6716:454,Modifiability,variab,variable,454,"Cromwell Version: 77. Hi Guys,. Im not sure if this is a bug but I recently noticed this behaviour. Im trying to write a task that registers task S3 outputs at the end of a workflow in a third-party system and copy it to another S3 bucket. This task itself does not generate any files locally but at the end of its execution I expect a new S3 object to appear in the destination bucket. The inputs and outputs are marshalled using a struct with a ""File"" variable for the S3 path of the objects. After the task executes Cromwell throws an error scala.MatchError - it recognises that the output is a `cromwell.filesystems.s3.S3Path` but dosn't appear to know what to do with it. Im wondering if it is because the ""file"" is created outside of the workflow workspace?. My work around is to use the `String` type in place of `File` type for ""path"" and cast back to `File` later in the workflow but this feels inelegant. Input:. {; ""main.bucket"" : ""my_bucket_2"" ,; ""main.file_list"":[; { ""path"": ""s3://my_bucket_1/a2c193f0-8f08-11ec-8c2a-0a58a9feac02/bob.html""}; ]; }. Expected Output:. [; {; ""id"": ""123""; ""path"": ""s3://my_bucket_2/a2c193f0-8f08-11ec-8c2a-0a58a9feac02/bob.html""; }; ].
