Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; \(R_{vdW}\), while an overall scaling term, \(s_6\), is optimized; to be unique to each \(E_{xc}\) functional. (\(\alpha_6\) is; sometimes allowed to vary as well.). (1)¶\[E_{disp}^{\text{D2}}=-s_6 \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}} \frac{C_6^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^6} f_{damp}(R_{ij})\]. \[f_{damp}(R_{ij}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{- \alpha_6 (R_{ij}/R_{vdW} - 1)}}\]; Grimme recently presented a refined method, DFT-D3, [Grimme:2010:154104]; which incorporates an additional \(R^{-8}\) term in the dispersion; series and adjusts the \(C_{6}^{ij}\) combination formula and damping; function.

From version 3.1.0 onwards, DFTD3 can; be used as-is; for earlier versions, patches are available:; psi4/psi4/share/psi4/scripts/patch_grimme_dftd3.3.0.2. To be used by PSI4, the program binary (dftd3) must be; found in your PSIPATH or PATH (in that order). If; PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error will be reported.; To preferentially use a particular dftd3 compilation, simply adjust its; position in the path environment variables. Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dftd3.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dftd3.html

The parameters; fit for individual functionals are now \(s_6\), \(s_8\),; \(a_1\), and \(a_2\). \[E_{disp}^{\text{D3BJ}}=-\sum_{n=6,8} s_n \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}}; \frac{C_n^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^n + (f_{damp})^n}\]. \[f_{damp} = a_1 \sqrt{\frac{C_8^{ij}}{C_6^{ij}}} + a_2\]; All parameters characterizing the dispersion correction are taken from; http://toc.uni-muenster.de/DFTD3/; or else from the literature. Running DFTD3¶; A number of a posteriori dispersion corrections are available in; PSI4. While most are computed within PSI4’s codebase (-D1, -D2,; -CHG, -DAS2009, -DAS2010), the -D3 correction and its variants are; available only through the DFTD3 program. Once installed, the; dftd3/PSI4 interface is transparent, and all corrections are; interfaced exactly alike.; Dispersion corrections are built into DFT functionals, so appending an a; posteriori correction to a computation is as simple as; energy('b2plyp-d') vs. energy('b2plyp'). For example, the; following input file computes (with much redundant work) for water a; B3LYP, a B3LYP-D2, and a B3LYP-D3 (zero-damping) energy.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11molecule h2o {; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; energy('b3lyp'); energy('b3lyp-d'); energy('b3lyp-d3'). Consult the table -D Functionals to see for each; functional what corrections are available and what default parameters; define them. The dispersion correction is available after a calculation in; the PSI variable DISPERSION CORRECTION ENERGY.; By default, the output from the dftd3; program is suppressed; to see it in the output file, set print > 2.

Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation. Spectroscopic Constants for Diatomics¶; Code author: Andrew C. Simmonett. psi4.driver.diatomic.anharmonicity(rvals, energies, plot_fit)[source]¶; Generates spectroscopic constants for a diatomic molecules.; Fits a diatomic potential energy curve using a weighted least squares approach; (c.f. http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4862157, particularly eqn. 7), locates the minimum; energy point, and then applies second order vibrational perturbation theory to obtain spectroscopic; constants. Any number of points greater than 4 may be provided, and they should bracket the minimum.; The data need not be evenly spaced, and can be provided in any order. The data are weighted such that; those closest to the minimum have highest impact.; A dictionary with the following keys, which correspond to spectroscopic constants, is returned:. Parameters:; rvals (list) – The bond lengths (in Angstrom) for which energies are; provided, of length at least 5 and equal to the length of the energies array; energies (list) – The energies (Eh) computed at the bond lengths in the rvals list; plot_fit (string) – A string describing where to save a plot of the harmonic and anharmonic fits, the; inputted data points, re, r0 and the first few energy levels, if matplotlib; is available.

Contributions: Intro to Programming in PSI4. Documentation¶; PSI4’s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman. It is available online at; http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/index.html; for the latest development branch. Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from psicode, so most users and developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; Math is rendered through MathJax, so LaTeX and dvipng are no longer needed.; The sphinx executable should be in your path at CMake configure time for; documentation targets to be available.

Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in the same; format, hyperlinking within and to external websites, and generating; documentation in different formats from the same source.

To build PSI4 from source and use; erd from conda without thinking, consult sec:condapsi4dev.; To remove a conda installation, conda remove erd. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want erd built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_erd,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code. How to configure erd for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html:11057,Availability,avail,available,11057,"ded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the psi4.set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17# A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf').

For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; 1set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node. The total memory requested for; the job by PBS should generally be slightly greater than what indicated; in the input file (see memory setting).; Then, we move to the working directory using PBS variable $PBS_O_WORKDIR and; we create scratch directories on every node, using the $PBS_NODEFILE which; points to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html

( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/external/modules:${PSIPATH}; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/python/modules:${PSIPATH}.

In the; present example, we make sure the variable is set with if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; before adding more paths to it. Finally, PSI_SCRATCH should point to a fast, existing; local disk for temporary file storage. To use 4 threads for OpenMP parallelization; and threaded BLAS (see section Threading), we set -n4 below.; The next step is then to actually run the computation:; 1/psi/install/directory/bin/psi4 -i input.in -o input.out -n 4.

Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; The set of three commands below are completely equivalent, while the fourth is,; perhaps, the most common usage.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5>>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

This also means that if the user wants PSI4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; 1energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next PSI4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file. If two or more files; are to be read, they need to be provided as a Python list; 1energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']). Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing PSI4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; 1psi4 -m. ~/.psi4rc File¶; If using the environment variable PSI_SCRATCH is inconvenient,; or if some psi4_io commands must be present in all input files,; the ~/.psi4rc resource file can be used (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; All the commands mentioned in section Scratch Files and Elementary Restart can be used in this file.; To set up the scratch path:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user').

The Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. As a consequence, the commands in the input files supersede; any instructions in the ~/.psi4rc file. During; execution, the ~/.psi4rc defaults will be loaded in first, but then the commands; in the input file will be executed.; The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html

(2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the psi4.set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17# A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; 1set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

During; execution, the ~/.psi4rc defaults will be loaded in first, but then the commands; in the input file will be executed.; The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html

Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; 1; 2; 3; 4import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/').

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables.

PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user').

For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; 1; 2; 3; 4import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True). A guide to the contents of individual scratch files may be found at PSIOH Intermediate Files.; To circumvent difficulties with running multiple jobs in the same scratch, the; process ID (PID) of the PSI4 instance is incorporated into the full file; name; therefore, it is safe to use the same scratch directory for calculations; running simultaneously. This also means that if the user wants PSI4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; 1energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next PSI4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file. If two or more files; are to be read, they need to be provided as a Python list; 1energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']).",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external-1.html

Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the psi4.set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17# A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf').

For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; 1set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation.

Default: Truncate first. -h, --help¶; Display the command-line options and usage information. -i <filename>, --input <filename>¶; Input file name. Default: input.dat. -k, --skip-preprocessor¶; Skips input preprocessing.

OMP_NESTED¶; Do access nested DGEMM in OpenMP sections in DFMP2 for multi-socket; platforms. This is very low-level access to OpenMP functions for; experienced programmers. Users should leave this variable unset or set; to False. OMP_NUM_THREADS¶; Number of threads to use by modules with OpenMP threading. PATH¶; Path for interfaced executables. Note; Configuring PSI4 through PSIPATH is preferred; to modifying this environment variable. To run Kállay’s MRCC program; (see MRCC), the dmrcc executable must be in PATH.; Likewise to run Grimme’s dftd3 program (see dftd3), the; dftd3 executable must be in PATH. PSI_SCRATCH¶; Directory where scratch files are written. Overrides settings in ~/.psi4rc.; It is very important to ensure that PSI4 is writing its scratch files; to a disk drive physically attached to the computer running the computation.; If it is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; Modify PSI_SCRATCH through normal Linux shell commands before invoking psi4; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /scratch/user. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/scratch/user. PSIPATH¶; Path in which PSI4 looks for user extensions to the built-in; libraries. Specifically, directories containing; user basis sets,; EFP fragments,; databases,; plugins, and; interfaced executables (; dmrcc for MRCC and; dftd3 for DFTD3; ) should be placed in this colon-separated list.; PSI4 is designed so that user extensions that are findable through; PSIPATH can be used in input files entirely like their; built-in counterparts, without additional tagging as non-standard.; The typical search path is first the built-in libraries, next each; PSIPATH directory in order, and finally the execution; directory (I won’t swear everything tacks on the execution directory).; Path",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html

For; PSI4, these are generally plugins or databases.; Modify PSIPATH through normal Linux shell commands before invoking psi4; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSIPATH /home/user/psiadditions:/home/user/gbs. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSIPATH=/home/user/psiadditions:/home/user/gbs. PYTHONPATH¶; Path in which the Python interpreter looks for modules to import. For; PSI4, these are generally plugins or databases. Note; Configuring PSI4 through PSIPATH is preferred; to modifying this environment variable. Modification of PYTHONPATH can be done in three ways, equivalently. Normal Linux shell commands.; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PYTHONPATH /home/user/psiadditions:$PYTHONPATH. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PYTHONPATH=/home/user/psiadditions:$PYTHONPATH. Place the path in the ~/.psi4rc file so that it is available for; every PSI4 instance.; 1sys.path.insert(0, '/home/user/psiadditions'). Place the path in the input file, either absolute or relative.; 1; 2sys.path.insert(0, '../../psiadditions'); sys.path.insert(0, '/home/user/psiadditions'). PSIDATADIR¶; Path in which the PSI4 executable looks for its non-compiled; dependencies (i.e., basis sets, databases, quadratures, etc.).; This path is always known by the PSI4 program or shared library,; so this variable is relevant primarily to developers wanting a; non-standard location. Value should be set; to directory containing driver, basis, etc. directories, generally; ending in share/psi4. table of contents.

The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node. The total memory requested for; the job by PBS should generally be slightly greater than what indicated; in the input file (see memory setting).; Then, we move to the working directory using PBS variable $PBS_O_WORKDIR and; we create scratch directories on every node, using the $PBS_NODEFILE which; points to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html

The next section is very important as it sets the environment variables needed; by PSI4:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/external/modules:${PSIPATH}; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/python/modules:${PSIPATH}. PSIDATADIR does not need to be set.; In the present example we unset it to make sure it does not interfere with the internal location-finding.; PSIPATH is needed only if you are using external modules or; plugins in PSI4 and should point to the directories where they can be found. In the; present example, we make sure the variable is set with if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; before adding more paths to it. Finally, PSI_SCRATCH should point to a fast, existing; local disk for temporary file storage. To use 4 threads for OpenMP parallelization; and threaded BLAS (see section Threading), we set -n4 below.; The next step is then to actually run the computation:; 1/psi/install/directory/bin/psi4 -i input.in -o input.out -n 4. And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; 1; 2; 3; 4foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; The set of three commands below are completely equivalent, while the fourth is,; perhaps, the most common usage.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5>>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

This also means that if the user wants PSI4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; 1energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next PSI4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file. If two or more files; are to be read, they need to be provided as a Python list; 1energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']). Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing PSI4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; 1psi4 -m. ~/.psi4rc File¶; If using the environment variable PSI_SCRATCH is inconvenient,; or if some psi4_io commands must be present in all input files,; the ~/.psi4rc resource file can be used (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; All the commands mentioned in section Scratch Files and Elementary Restart can be used in this file.; To set up the scratch path:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user').

The Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. As a consequence, the commands in the input files supersede; any instructions in the ~/.psi4rc file. During; execution, the ~/.psi4rc defaults will be loaded in first, but then the commands; in the input file will be executed.; The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html

(2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the psi4.set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17# A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; 1set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Scratch Files and Elementary Restart¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file.; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files.

PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; 1; 2; 3; 4import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_rete",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html

During; execution, the ~/.psi4rc defaults will be loaded in first, but then the commands; in the input file will be executed.; The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html

Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; 1; 2; 3; 4import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True).

This also means that if the user wants PSI4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; 1energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next PSI4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads.

From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4.

PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; 1; 2; 3; 4import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/').

An example input for this feature is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17# A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/external.html

Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103].

Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103].

Order-1 Visualization with PyMol¶; The fsapt.py script above also generates a number of order-1 .pdb files; that can be used to get a quick qualitative picture of the F-SAPT partition.

Ed’s code uses the -RI; basis sets for all SAPT terms, which can be problematic for heavy elements.; As such, Ed’s SAPT0 code will yield slightly different results than FISAPT. The; differences should be very minor for up to and including second-row elements,; after which point one needs to use the DF_BASIS_ELST option in Ed’s code to; provide an accurate result. table of contents.

Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; A video tutorial series for the use of the FISAPT module is available here.; Specific videos in the series include:.

Generally the view orientation and some specific; details of the .pymol files require some small tweaks to permit; publication-quality renderings. F/I-SAPT Keywords¶; The input files described above cover roughly 90% of all F/I-SAPT analyses. For; more delicate or involved problems, there are a large number of user options; that permit the customization of the I-SAPT subsystem partition, the convergence; of the IBO localization procedure, numerical thresholds, etc. We have an entire; video tutorial devoted to these options F/I-SAPT Options.; Direct source-code documentation on these options is available :ref:`here; <apdx:fisapt_psivar>`_. Additional Notes¶. Caution; In constrast to Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code, FISAPT uses the -JKFIT; auxiliary basis sets for all Fock-type terms (e.g., electrostatics, exchange,; induction, and core Fock matrix elements in exchange-dispersion), and the -RI; auxiliary basis sets only for the dispersion term. Ed’s code uses the -RI; basis sets for all SAPT terms, which can be problematic for heavy elements.; As such, Ed’s SAPT0 code will yield slightly different results than FISAPT. The; differences should be very minor for up to and including second-row elements,; after which point one needs to use the DF_BASIS_ELST option in Ed’s code to; provide an accurate result. table of contents.

By default, linking sigma; bonds are assigned to C (this can be changed by the FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT; options). Then, non-interacting Hartree–Fock solutions for A and B are optimized; in the embedding field of the linking moiety C. At this point, A and B are not; interacting with each other, but have any potential covalent links or other; interactions with C built in by the embedding. A standard F-SAPT0 computation; is then performed between A and B, yielding the I-SAPT interaction energy. Any; F-SAPT considerations are also possible when I-SAPT is performed – F and I are; completely direct-product-separable considerations. Cube File Visualization with PyMol¶; Setting FISAPT_DO_PLOT true above generates a set of .cube files; containing the densities and ESPs of the various subsystems in the I-SAPT; embedding procedure. These can be used to gain a detailed understanding of the; intermolecular partition and the polarization between non-interacting and; Hartree–Fock-interacting moieties. We have developed a set of template; .pymol scripts to help with this process. These can be obtained by running:; 1>>> copy_pymol2.py. and then in PyMol:; 1>>> @run.pymol. This last command runs all of the individual .pymol files (e.g.,; DA.pymol), which in turn load in the molecule and cube file data; (contained in the .cube file), set up the visualization, and render a; .png image of the scene.

Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; A video tutorial series for the use of the FISAPT module is available here.; Specific videos in the series include:.

Coupled electron pair approximation¶; Coupled-pair methods can be viewed as approximations to CCSD or as; size-extensive modifications of CISD. The methods have the same; complexity as CISD, and solving the CISD or coupled-pair equations; requires fewer floating point operations than solving the CCSD.

This convenient property allows density; matrices and 1-electron properties to be evaluated without any additional; effort. Note, however, that 1-electron properties are currently; unavailable when coupling these stationary CEPA-like methods with frozen; natural orbitals. Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) [or the resolution of the identity (RI)] and Cholesky; decomposition (CD) techniques are popular in quantum chemistry to avoid; the computation and storage of the 4-index electron repulsion integral; (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the computational scaling of some terms.; DF/CD-CCSD(T) computations are available in PSI4, with or without the; use of FNOs, through the FNOCC module. The implementation and accuracy of; the DF/CD-CCSD(T) method are described in [DePrince:2013:2687].; The DF-CCSD(T) procedure uses two auxiliary basis sets. The first set is; that used in the SCF procedure, defined by the DF_BASIS_SCF; keyword. If this keyword is not specified, an appropriate -JKFIT set is; automatically selected.

Eugene DePrince; Section author: A. Eugene DePrince; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FNOCC. Warning; There is a known bug concerning the i7-5930 series combined; with the Intel 15 compilers and MKL 11.2.3. When PSI4 is compiled; under these conditions, parallel runs of the FNOCC code have experienced; nonsensical CCSD correlation energies (often several Hartrees lower; than the starting guess).
