You are hereHome » ROOT 6 Analysis Workshop 2. Running code in ROOT. Interpreting; ROOT executes your C++ code. There are two ways: loading it into the interpreter or compiling it as a shared library. Either way, it's easiest to provide a function that has the same name as the file. For instance you could have a file printTree.C containing; int printTree(TFile* file, const char* name) {; TTree* tree = 0;; file->GetObject(name, tree);; if (tree) {; tree->Print();; return 0;; } else {; Error(""printTree()"", ""Cannot find tree %s!"", name);; return -1;; }; }. You can now run this as; .x printTree.C(file, ""MyTree"");. This is equivalent to; .L printTree.C; printTree(file, ""MyTree"");. Compiling; You can also have your code compiled into a shared library, simply by adding a ""+"" behind the file name:; .x printTree.C+(file, ""MyTree"");. In the above example this will fail: we need to add the #includes for he compiler to be able to understand the code, while the interpreter has a lot of contextual knowledge and can automatically include headers and load libraries.; Expressions; You saw that with "".x"", ROOT prints the result of running the function whil",MatchSource.WIKI,d/2-running-code-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/2-running-code-root.html

What we usually care about is its distribution - for instance by counting how often electrons have an energy within a certain range. Such a range is called ""bin"". Let's look at an example: draw the histogram of the momentum (""fPt"") of all electrons with an energy (""fE"") > 80 and fTriggered being true.; Binning; You can tell TTree::Draw() what the binning should be:; tree->Draw(""electrons.fE >> htemp(15, 0., 30.)"",...). will use 15 bins, where the lower bin border of the first bin is at 0. and the upper bin border of the highest is at 30.; Style; ROOT displays a few properties for the histogram in the box in the upper right. You can move things around in the graphical display (""canvas"") of the histogram. You can modify graphical properties of the canvas by showing the editor: in the menu, select ""View"", then ""Editor"". Click on the histogram to select it, then change its visual appearance to magenta line, 5 pixels width, with pink fill. Eeew.

Parameter correlations; We want to know what muons.fTriggered depends on. A simple check is to look for correlations: variables that it depends on might be linearly correlated. TMVA tells us that the muon and the X position is completely uncorrelated. It also tells us that the muons' pT and energy are somewhat correlated. But what would be the best parameter to determine the muon trigger efficiency - what is most correlated with it?; . ‹ 5. Fitting; up; 7. Using the TTreeReader ›. Navigate through this book; 0.

Integrability,depend,depends,"y for higher muon momenta - let's check that!; For that we need to draw two variables: how many were fired and ho many were not, against the momentum of the muon. We could put the fired / not fired on the y-axis, and the muon momentum on the x-axis. You can do that with TTree::Draw(""yExpression:xExpression""). It should give you the top histogram above, where the y-axis has a value of 0 for not triggered muons and of 1 for triggered muons.; The default output puts one tiny dot at each point - which is fairly useless on our case. So specify as the third option to TTree::Draw() a different drawing option - we want ""BOX"" here, which should give the the second histogram with box sizes proportional to histogram bin entries.; This plot shows that for lower pT most muons are not triggered, while for higher pT most muons are triggered. The efficiency is thus rising with pT. We will study this in more detail in the following steps.; Multivariate Analysis with TMVA; Now let's assume we want to see whether the muon trigger also depends on the muon X position, i.e. whether it fires more often for instance when the muon was created farther away from the beam pipe. This would mean that there is e.g. a linear correlation between the muon trigger and the position.; ROOT offers TMVA, a tool widely used in physics analyses for analyzing higher dimensional dependencies.

Every day, thousands of physicists use ROOT applications to analyze their data or to perform simulations. With ROOT you can:. Save data You can save your data (and any C++ object) in a compressed binary form in a ROOT file. The object format is also saved in the same file: the ROOT files are self-descriptive. Even in the case the source files describing the data model are not available, the information contained in a ROOT file is be always readable. ROOT provides a data structure, the tree, that is extremely powerful for fast access of huge amounts of data - orders of magnitude faster than accessing a normal file.; Access data Data saved into one or several ROOT files can be accessed from your PC, from the web and from large-scale file delivery systems used e.g. in the GRID. ROOT trees spread over several files can be chained and accessed as a unique object, allowing for loops over huge amounts of data.; Mine data Powerful mathematical and statistical tools are provided to operate on your data. The full power of a C++ application and of parallel processing is available for any kind of data manipulation.

What is a Selector?; To benefit from many ROOT features (e.g. PROOF and PROOF-lite) you should use a class deriving from the TSelector to analyze a TTree. The selector's code will be used by calling TTree::Process().; We provide a TSelector derived class in a simple source file. So please download the following source file and save it where you can find it: EventSelector.C. This is a skeleton of our selector.; N.B. If you are using ROOT via ssh, you have to download the file with wget from your remote directory.

Then open the file again:; root[0] TFile::Open(""http://root.cern/files/introtutorials/eventdata.root"");. Processing a Selector on a Tree; To apply this selector on the tree you do not call the selector directly; instead, the selector is passed to the tree which then runs it (see the documentation of TTree::Process()):; root[1] EventTree->Process(""EventSelector.C""). As you can see, nothing happens because our selector is empty. So lets see what we can do with this selector.; Editing the Selector Skeleton; Open the downloaded selector file (EventSelector.C) in a text editor, e.g. with vi, emacs, wordpad, Eclipse...

After the TSelector has processed the tree it will thus contain the sum of all event sizes.; Bool_t EventSelector::Process(Long64_t entry); {; //... // Tell the TTree reader to get the data for; // the entry number ""entry"" in the current tree:; fReader.SetLocalEntry(entry);. // We can still print some informations about the current event; //printf(""Size of Event %ld = %d Bytes\n"", entry, *fCurrentEventSize);. // compute the total size of all events; dereference the TTreeReaderValue; // using '*' to get the value it refers to, just like an iterator.; fTotalDataSize += *fCurrentEventSize;. return kTRUE;; }. Accessing the Analysis Result; In your selector's Terminate() function, print the sum of all event sizes. This sum shows you the real power of a TTree: even though you can analyze large amounts of data (our example tree with 22MB is tiny!) ROOT needs just a few MB of your RAM, no matter how many events you analyze.

See the Build Options and Variables sections for fine-tuning your build; This can fail if CMake can’t detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the environment is not sane enough. On this case make sure that the toolset that you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell and that the shell itself is the correct one for you development environment. You can force CMake to use a given build tool, see the Usage section.; After CMake has finished running, proceed to use IDE project files or start the build from the build directory:; $ cmake --build .

The --build option tells cmake to invoke the underlying build tool (make, ninja, xcodebuild, msbuild, etc).; The underlying build tool can also be invoked directly of course, but thecmake --build command is more portable.; On unix systems (with make or ninja) you can speedup the build with cmake --build . -- -jN where N is the number of available cores.; Setup the environment to run; $ source /path/to/install-or-build/dir/bin/thisroot.sh. Start ROOT interactive application; $ root. Installation methods; There are two main methods of installing ROOT from source: location independent and fix location. The former is advised for a personal installation of ROOT, while the later for a system wide installation. Both require to set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable at configuration time. The later requires in addition to set the gnuinstall option at configuration. It also allows the tuning of destinations for the various components, by setting the variablesCMAKE_INSTALL_xxxDIR, wherexxx isBIN,LIB,INCLUDE, etc. The full list is described in the variables section.; To use the location independent installation requires to set environment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This is done by sourcing the script (depending on the shell family) source bin/thisroot.sh.

If you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.; Preparation; Check the prerequisites and supported platforms for the list of packages needed for your setup before starting the build.; Quick Start; The following are the basic instructions for UNIX systems. We use here the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. Download and unpack the ROOT's sources from the download area or using directly the Git repository. Follow the instructions for getting the ROOT sources; Open a shell. Your development tools must be reachable from this shell through the PATH environment variable.; Create a directory for containing the build.

Of course you will be duly credited and your name will appear on the contributors page and in the CREDITS file shipped with every binary and source distribution. The copyright transfer is necessary for us to be able to effectively defend the project in case of litigation.; Presently, there are two ways in which you can contribute:; 1. Via the Users' contribution section in the Forum; The Users' Forum has a section which describes how to submit contributions. It is the easiest way to make your code known to the community, even if it will not be automatically integrated in ROOT. Of course the most successful contributions will become part of the repository!; 2. Sending Patches; You can send us a patch or a pull request with Github, provided that you follow these two simple rules:. Make sure you follow the ROOT coding conventions in your code; Make sure you provide a set of tests for your feature/bug fix. Often it is useful to contact us first to discuss the code you want to develop or the bug you want to fix.; Picking up an Idea; We maintain a set of ""ideas"" for talented scientists and developers to pick up. An ""idea"" is a sketch of a development project, a functionality a missing feature we would like to see in our tool, in your ROOT! You can inspect the ideas in the following list.

Of course you will be duly credited and your name will appear on the contributors page and in the CREDITS file shipped with every binary and source distribution. The copyright transfer is necessary for us to be able to effectively defend the project in case of litigation.; Presently, there are two ways in which you can contribute:; 1. Via the Users' contribution section in the Forum; The Users' Forum has a section which describes how to submit contributions. It is the easiest way to make your code known to the community, even if it will not be automatically integrated in ROOT. Of course the most successful contributions will become part of the repository!; 2. Sending Patches; You can send us a patch or a pull request with Github, provided that you follow these two simple rules:. Make sure you follow the ROOT coding conventions in your code; Make sure you provide a set of tests for your feature/bug fix. Often it is useful to contact us first to discuss the code you want to develop or the bug you want to fix.; Picking up an Idea; We maintain a set of ""ideas"" for talented scientists and developers to pick up. An ""idea"" is a sketch of a development project, a functionality a missing feature we would like to see in our tool, in your ROOT! You can inspect the ideas in the following list.

You have set up git on our system; You have registered a GitHub account and forked the ROOT repository; You have cloned your forked ROOT repository using git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/root. After you have cloned the repository, you will be on the master branch. Do not make changes to the master branch, as this branch will contain the newest changes in ROOT we will later pull in to our feature branch.; Making your changes; Before implementing your changes, create a new branch that we will work on in isolation from master. In this case, we will name it histogram-race-condition-fix, but you may name it differently according to what your contribution will be.; git checkout -b histogram-race-condition-fix; After implementing your changes, add and commit your changes (More about how to use git here):; git add hist/hist/somefile.cxx; git commit -m ""Avoid race condition on Ubuntu 16.04""; git push --set-upstream origin histogram-race-condition-fix; Your changes are now in your forked repository on GitHub. We will now make the pull request.; Making the pull request on GitHub; If you go to https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/root, you will see a notification saying ""Your recently pushed branches: histogram-race-condition-fix (some minutes ago)"":. You can now hit the green ""Compare & pull request"" button which lets you create the pull request.; Fill in a reasonable description of what your new feature is, and hit ""Create pull request"". A project member will later initiate a build of your pull request and then review your pull request before giving feedback and in the end hopefully merge it. More about how what happens after submitting the pull request can be found in the contributing readme.; Pulling the last changes from upstream/master; Often, there might have been changes in the upstream/master repository that you want to have toget",MatchSource.WIKI,d/creating-pull-request.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/creating-pull-request.html

You are hereHome » Development Formatting Comments for Doxygen. The ROOT team has adopted Doxygen for generating the reference manual. Here you will find a number of conventions and tips for converting the existing source code to generate proper documentation.; How to generate the doxygen documentation; Developers may generate the documentation by hand to see the results of the current changes before committing them to the repository. The automatic daily Jenkins procedures will generate the complete set of documentation.; $ cd <root_sources>/documentation/doxygen ; $ make . The results are placed by default at ${HOME}/rootdoc/html. The file documentation/doxygen/Doxyfile can be edited to reduce the number of input files and thus reduce the time for generating the HTML pages. The property to be modified is INPUT = ../../<module>; General Guidelines; Classes and methods can be documented both in the .cxx and .h files. For the long descriptions of a class functionality and its methods we usually prefer the .cxx file.; Class documentation; The documentation for the class is in general located at the beginning of the .cxx file. The \class Doxygen command is mandatory otherwise Doxygen will not associate the comments to the proper class. The first sentence is a brief description of the class and will appear in all class listings. For an example see the TF2 class documentation:; /** \class TF2; A 2-Dim function with parameters;  ; TF2 graphics function is via the TH1 drawing functions.; Example of a function;  ; TF2 *f2 = new TF2(""f2"",""sin(x)*sin(y)/(x*y)"",0,5,0,5);; f2->Draw();;  ; \image html tf2_function2.png; See TF1 class for the list of functions formats; */; Method documentation; Met",MatchSource.WIKI,d/formatting-comments-doxygen.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/formatting-comments-doxygen.html

Availability,avail,available,"commit:. Undo the commit:; git reset --soft HEAD^. Do stuff.; Recommit:; git commit -a -m <message> -c ORIG_HEAD. Note that the -c ORIG_HEAD clause causes git to use the meta-data from the previous HEAD (author, etc) with the exception of the commit message. Changing the -c to -C and omitting the -m option will cause git to reuse the commit message too. Recover deleted (committed files). Get a list of all commits with deleted files:; git log --diff-filter=D --summary | less. Find your file and note the SHA1 hash for that commit.; Recover it:; git checkout <commit>^ -- file. Stage selected changes within a file. git add --patch ; Follow the on-screen directions. Tig: a simple and colored text-mode interface for Git; Tig is a command line tool that wraps many Git browse operations (like log, diff, show, status) in a colored text-mode interface based on ncurses. Tig has been written by Jonas Fonseca.; See the full Tig manual for a detailed description.; Obtaining Tig; Tig is available as package from many Linux distributions. On Debian/Ubuntu it is available with the package name tig from the default repositories.; On RHEL-based systems it is available from the additional repository RepoForge.; On OS X it is easily installed via Homebrew:; brew install tig. Tig pager mode; Many git commands can be piped into tig. When tig is invoked this way, it is in pager mode: output will be colored according to the input format, and colored.; For instance it is possible to pipe the differences of one file like this:; git diff path/to/file.cxx | tig. or see the changes of one revision like this:; git show b204d4c87 | tig. The most important interactive tig commands are:. 'h': opens the help screen; 'q': closes current window; 'Q': closes all windows and exits. Log view; Tig invoked without any argument spawns a full log view with one line per commit including author, date and log message. Heads of the different branches are clearly indicated.

Deployability,patch,patch,": Git is a truly distributed system.; Branches are easy to create, merge and destroy.; The, ""unit of change"" is a commit, labeled by its SHA1 hash. A tree's, ""state"" is a collection of commits. Merging branches multiple times is therefore trivial because it consists of comparing commit lists.; Git commit trees do not record history: they record changes. A simple change has one parent. Creating a branch creates another child of the parent commit; and a non-trivial merge joins two branches -- the resulting commit has two parents.

Disk space is cheap and rm -rf is easy. Note that you must copy the entire repository, since all the important information is in the .git directory tree at the top level. Stashing; This is a good way quickly to get a clean tree if you want to merge or rebase (see below) to import changes from a branch without having to commit your current work. Save uncommitted changes to the current working area to the stash (not a commit operation):; git stash. Apply previously-saved stash:; git stash pop.

Overview; This page gives some helpful hints and tricks on using git, along with a suggested work-flow, with an explanation of its motivation and details.; Some pertinent Git details; It is assumed at this point that you have a passing familiarity with CVS and/or Subversion; and that you have at least obtained a local copy (cloned) of a remote repository. Unlike CVS and SVN, every local working area is also a repository.; Unlike CVS and SVN, repositories are not sub-divisible: in the former systems, one can easily check out only a subsection of a package; with git, it's all-or-nothing.; A repository may have zero or more remote repositories to which items may be pushed (or from which they may be retrieved): Git is a truly distributed system.; Branches are easy to create, merge and destroy.; The, ""unit of change"" is a commit, labeled by its SHA1 hash. A tree's, ""state"" is a collection of commits. Merging branches multiple times is therefore trivial because it consists of comparing commit lists.; Git commit trees do not record history: they record changes. A simple change has one parent. Creating a branch creates another child of the parent commit; and a non-trivial merge joins two branches -- the resulting commit has two parents.

You are hereHome » Documentation » Courses » Introductory Tutorials Histogramming in a Selector. Preparation; As previously, we provide a ready-made TSelector derived class in a simple source file. So please download also the following source file and save it where you can find it: EventDataSelector.C (or wget http://root-mirror.github.io/training/intro/EventDataSelector.C).; This selector contains all the necessary steps to read the data from the tree branches, like the number of particles, the X position of each particle PosX[nparticles], and the absolute momentum of each particle Momentum[nparticles].; Now quit and restart ROOT (to make sure everybody starts from the same point). Then open the file again:; root[0] TFile::Open(""http://root.cern/files/introtutorials/eventdata.root"");. Adding a Data Member; Just like for the sum of event sizes, you need to add a data member to the class. As in Histogramming, we want to histogram the particles' fPosX; the type of the data member should thus be TH1F*. Don't forget to initialize the histogram pointer to 0 in the constructor, again just like for the event size sum.; Creating the Histogram; You then create the object with new TH1F(""hPosX"", ""Position in X"", 20, -5, 5);; check the docum",MatchSource.WIKI,d/histogramming-selector.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/histogramming-selector.html

As in Histogramming, we want to histogram the particles' fPosX; the type of the data member should thus be TH1F*. Don't forget to initialize the histogram pointer to 0 in the constructor, again just like for the event size sum.; Creating the Histogram; You then create the object with new TH1F(""hPosX"", ""Position in X"", 20, -5, 5);; check the documentation of TSelector to learn in which of your selector's functions to create the histogram object.; Associate error bars with this histogram (see TH1F::Sumw2()); Filling the Histogram; Like in the Histogramming chapter, fill the histogram with the value of fPosX from the tree for all particles with a momentum > 40.; Just like before, the per-event analysis happens in Process(). Here again, you need to get the tree entry before you can access the corresponding data members of your selector.; Fitting and Drawing the Histogram; Here again, once the histogram is filled, fit it with a pol2 using TH1::Fit(""pol2"").; See the documentation of TSelector on where to do the fitting, i.e. which function of your selector gets called after the whole tree has been processed. You should first fit and then draw, to see the fit together with the histogram.; At the end, you should get the same result than the figure 6 in Histogramming; If, for any reason, you don't manage to get it working, you can download the working selector file here: FullEventDataSelector.C (or; wget http://root-mirror.github.io/training/intro/FullEventDataSelector.C); Note: You will have to use it that way:; EventTree->Process(""FullEventDataSelector.C""). . ‹ Accessing a TTree With a TSelector; up; Using a TSelector with PROOF ›.

The TTreeReaderArray works just like the TTreeReaderValue we have used before, but gives you access to the number of particles using particlesMomentum.GetSize() and the n-th particle using the particlesMomentum[n] operator.; The analysis happens in loops. The outer loop is iterating through the TTree entries, using the TTreeReader::Next() loop - just as before. For each TTree entry, loop over all particles of the TTree entry with a simple for loop.

'slc6', 'centos7', 'fedora14', 'mac1012', etc.; COMPILER is the compiler and version. E.g. 'icc16', 'clang37', 'native' (for the native compiler), etc.; BUILDTYPE is the type of the build. E.g. Release, Debug; EXTERNALS is the label for the set of versions of the externals. Typically 'ROOT-date', but 'ROOT-latest' is a safe bet. . git clone http://root.cern.ch/git/rootspi.git ; source rootspi/jenkins/jk-setup.sh slc6 icc14 Release ROOT-latest. Debugging an existing nightly build; Often when a build has failed in the nightlies we are required to debug it. The following are the instructions to get the correct environment for starting the debug session. As input you need to know the node name and the working directory in the build node (and the password of the sftnight account). You can get this information from the logs in Jenkins or CDash.; $ ssh sftnight@<node-name>; $ cd <work-directory>; $ source setup.sh; $ cd build; $ ctest -V -R <failing test>; or; $ make <failing target>.

A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data; prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs; (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work; which has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based on the; Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under; copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a; portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated; straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is; included without limitation in the term ""modification"".). ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for; making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means; all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated; interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation; and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not; covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of; running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from; such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based; on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for; writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does; and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's; complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that; you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an; appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact; all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any; warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the; Library.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion; of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and; distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1; above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:. a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,; in the event an application does not supply such function or; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of; its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the; application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any; application-supplied function or table used by this function must; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square; root function must still compute square roots.). These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If; identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,; and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in; themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those; sections when you distribute them as separate works.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS; ; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries. If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest; possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that; everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting; redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the; ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is; safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively; convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the; ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does>; Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>. This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or; modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either; version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU; Lesser General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

If you link other code with the library, you must provide; complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them; with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling; it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the; library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal; permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that; there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is; modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know; that what they have is not the original version, so that the original; author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be; introduced by others.; ; Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of; any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot; effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a; restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that; any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be; consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the; ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser; General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and; is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use; this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those; libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using; a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a; combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary; General Public License therefore permits such linking only if th",MatchSource.WIKI,d/license.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/license.html

For more information about TTree, see http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TTree.html; So let's see what is in this tree...; We have created two example classes, again to illustrate a typical (but very minimal) setup of an experiment's data. You don't need a library with these classes (though ROOT will print ""Warning in : no dictionary for class EventData/Particle is available"") because a TTree knows what data is stored inside. The EventData class contains a vector (std::vector) of particles represented by a ""Particle"" class and the total size (in bytes) of the event itself:; class EventData {; public:; std::vector<Particle> fParticles; // particles of the event; int fEventSize; // size (in bytes) of the event; };. The data members of the Particle class describe the particle properties as shown below:; class Particle {; public:; double fPosX,fPosY,fPosZ; // particle position nearest to interaction point; double fMomentum; // particle momentum; double fMomentumPhi; // particle direction (phi); double fMomentumEta; // particle direction (eta); Long64_t fTags[128]; // particle tags; };. The TTree contains a branch event, which in turn contains the branches fParticles and fEventSize. It simply reflects the layout of class EventData. Each TTree entry has one object of type class EventData, which in turn has a collection",MatchSource.WIKI,d/meet-ttree.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/meet-ttree.html

The TTree contains a branch event, which in turn contains the branches fParticles and fEventSize. It simply reflects the layout of class EventData. Each TTree entry has one object of type class EventData, which in turn has a collection of particles. Each tree entry can have a different number of particles. There are 200 TTree entries containing a total of 22994 particles.; If you are curious how we generated the TTree: the script is in our git repository.; . ‹ Introductory Tutorials; up; Accessing a TTree With a TBrowser ›.

The following people have been working on ROOT for some time in their career and ROOT would not be what it is without their contributions:; Andrei Gheata; Andrei works since 2001 in the offline group of the ALICE experiment. He is an experimental nuclear physicist who worked before ALICE on data analysis for heavy-ion experiments in emulsions. In 2000 he started collaborating with the ROOT project and implemented the TreeViewer interface. Andrei is the main developer of the ROOT geometry package. He integrated the geometry in the Virtual Monte Carlo framework by developing interfaces for the GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA particle transport engines.; Anna Kreshuk; Anna was a project associate and contributed to different parts of ROOT, most notably to the fitting machinery, the interface to FFTW, numerous math-related functions, TEntryList container and PROOF GUI.; David Gonzalez Maline; David has been working on improving the performance and correctness of various mathematical algorithms as well as on integrating AI methods for data analysis inside the framework. He has also worked on extending and improving the FitPanel interface.; Diego Marcos Segura; Diego worked as technical student on CINT dictionary optimizations.; Eddy Offermann; Eddy joined the ROOT team during a sabbatical to work on making the ROOT matrix package the fastest and most versatile in the industry.; Ilka Antcheva; Ilka has been working from 2002 to 2008 in the ROOT team.

HIGZ has been the standard graphics package in High Energy Physics for years and is still being used. He was responsible for the PAW system from 1995 until he joined the ROOT team in 2002 and took responsibility of the graphics work package.; ; .

The trick is that only selected parts of it are in memory at any given time. Here, with the help of some illustrations by our colleague Ioannis, we see how to extract these parts. Sit back and enjoy - in this step there is nothing for you to run.; Too much data! Let's assume a TTree holds ""all the worlds' newspapers of all times"". That's a lot, and no way would you want to have that delivered in one serving. So how you can make access to the newspapers more reasonable?; TBranch; Of course you don't care about all newspapers.

Why using a macro?; As real analyses don't fit into simple TTree::Draw() invocations, and as it is quite cumbersome to type the same lines again and again in the Root prompt, simply create macros for commonly used code. A macro is a file that is interpreted by ROOT.; Creating and Editing the Macro; Create a macro (e.g. AnalyzeTree.C) using your favorite text editor, e.g. with vi, emacs, wordpad, Eclipse, Visual Studio,... The macro should start with the proper #include statements and should contain the function declaration with the same name than the macro itself. As we know we're going to use TFile and TTree (at least), we can already include their headers TFile.h and TTree.h. Then come the function implementation.; Function Implementation; Lets start with something simple: calculate the sum of all event sizes. For this we need a new variable of type int.

It still has many shortcomings with C++ 2003, let alone C++11.; CINT maintenance; 	The original author of CINT, Masaharu Goto, has moved on; CINT has been maintained mainly by the ROOT team. It has 300k lines of code; that's a considerable fraction of ROOT's 2.5MLOC. It has been designed to fit into an integrated processing unit of appliances (like medical ones) - not for 16GB RAM, 8 compute thread, 50000 class environments.; Reflex and GCCXML solve it; 	ATLAS, CMS and LHCb use GCCXML to parse their headers, a set of python scripts to parse the generated XML file and write a C++ source file, the Reflex dictionary, which then gets compiled, linked, loaded, its data injected into the Reflex reflection database, which then gets copied through Cintex into CINT. We have thus many duplications of strings (three in the worst case with Reflex) and conflicts between duplicate dictionaries in Reflex versus CINT (famous: ""std::map<std::string, TH1*>"" must not be described through Reflex). On top of that, GCCXML is a limited parser (e.g. it swallows typedefs in certain conditions, think Double32_t); as it uses the GCC parser this will not be fixed. I.e. the current setup is fragile, inefficient, and limiting.; CINT is not relevant, I use PyROOT; 	For calling into C++, PyROOT relies on CINT's reflection data from ROOT (which is why it's so fantastic compared to static SWIG-based approaches). And ROOT relies on CINT for I/O, both the dictionaries and the interpreter. I.e. you use CINT much, much more than you think: it's not just the prompt, it in the core of most of ROOT.;  ; So we ne",MatchSource.WIKI,d/blog/do-we-need-yet-another-custom-c-interpreter.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/blog/do-we-need-yet-another-custom-c-interpreter.html

Connecting several RooAbsArg in a computation graph models an expression tree that can be evaluated. Building a computation graph of RooFit objects; Therefore, RooAbsArg provides functionality to connect objects of type RooAbsArg into a computation graph to pass values between those objects. A value can e.g. be a real-valued number, (instances of RooAbsReal), or an integer, that is, category index (instances of RooAbsCategory). The third subclass of RooAbsArg is RooStringVar, but it is rarely used.; The ""shapes"" that a RooAbsArg can possess can e.g. be the definition range of an observable, or how many states a category object has. In computations, values are expected to change often, while shapes remain mostly constant (unless e.g. a new range is set for an observable).; Nodes of a computation graph are connected using instances of RooAbsProxy. If Node B declares a member RooTemplateProxy<TypeOfNodeA>, Node A will be registered as a server of values to Node B, and Node B will know that it is a client of node A.

Using graphVizTree(), one can create a visualisation of the expression tree.; An instance of RooAbsArg can have named attributes. It also has flags to indicate that either its value or its shape were changed (= it is dirty). RooAbsArg provides functionality to manage client/server relations in a computation graph (clientServerInterface), and helps propagating value/shape changes through the graph. RooAbsArg implements interfaces for inspecting client/server relationships (clientServerInterface) and setting/clearing/querying named attributes. Caching of values; The values of nodes in the computation graph are cached in RooFit. If a value is used in two nodes of a graph, it doesn't need to be recomputed. If a node acquires a new value, it notifies its consumers (""clients"") that their cached values are dirty. See the functions in optimisationInterface for details. A node uses its isValueDirty() and isShapeDirty() functions to decide if a computation is necessary. Caching can be vetoed globally by setting a bit using setDirtyInhibit(). This will make computations slower, but all the nodes of the computation graph will be evaluated irrespective of whether their state is clean or dirty. Using setOperMode(), caching can also be enabled/disabled for single nodes. ; Definition at line 79 of file RooAbsArg.h. Classes; struct  ProxyListCache;  .

Instead, the choice of normalization is always specified each time a normalized value is requested from the PDF via the getVal() method.; RooAbsPdf manages the entire normalization logic of each PDF with the help of a RooRealIntegral object, which coordinates the integration of a given choice of normalization. By default, RooRealIntegral will perform an entirely numeric integration of all dependents. However, PDFs can advertise one or more (partial) analytical integrals of their function, and these will be used by RooRealIntegral, if it determines that this is safe (i.e., no hidden Jacobian terms, multiplication with other PDFs that have one or more dependents in common, etc).; Implem",MatchSource.WIKI,doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html

This function should return the PDF's value (which does not need to be normalised).; Normalization/Integration; Although the normalization of a PDF is an integral part of a probability density function, normalization is treated separately in RooAbsPdf. The reason is that a RooAbsPdf object is more than a PDF: it can be a building block for a more complex composite PDF if any of its variables are functions instead of variables. In such cases, the normalization of the composite PDF may not simply be integral over the dependents of the top-level PDF: these are functions with potentially non-trivial Jacobian terms themselves. NoteTherefore, no explicit attempt should be made to normalize the function output in evaluate(). In particular, normalisation constants can be omitted to speed up the function evaluations, and included later in the integration of the PDF (see below), which is rarely called in comparison to the evaluate() function.; In addition, RooAbsPdf objects do not have a static concept of what variables are parameters, and what variables are dependents (which need to be integrated over for a correct PDF normalization).

Every object it contains must have a unique name returned by GetName().; Contained objects are not ordered, although the set can be traversed using an iterator returned by createIterator(). The iterator does not necessarily follow the object insertion order.; Objects can be retrieved by name only, and not by index. Ownership of contents; Unowned objects are inserted with the add() method. Owned objects are added with addOwned() or addClone(). A RooArgSet either owns all of it contents, or none, which is determined by the first add call. Once an ownership status is selected, inappropriate add calls will return error status. Clearing the list via removeAll() resets the ownership status. Arguments supplied in the constructor are always added as unowned elements. Uniquely identifying RooArgSet objects; WarningBefore v6.28, it was ensured that no RooArgSet objects on the heap were located at an address that had already been used for a RooArgSet before. With v6.28, this is not guaranteed anymore.

There are n+1 Bernstein basis polynomials of degree n: ; \[; B_{i,n}(x) = \begin{pmatrix}n \\\ i \end{pmatrix} x^i \cdot (1-x)^{n-i}; \]. Thus, by providing n coefficients that are positive-definite, there is a natural way to have well-behaved polynomial PDFs. For any n, the n+1 polynomials 'form a partition of unity', i.e., they sum to one for all values of x. They can be used as a basis to span the space of polynomials with degree n or less: ; \[; PDF(x, c_0, ..., c_n) = \mathcal{N} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i \cdot B_{i,n}(x).; \]. By giving n+1 coefficients in the constructor, this class constructs the n+1 polynomials of degree n, and sums them to form an element of the space of polynomials of degree n. \( \mathcal{N} \) is a normalisation constant that takes care of the cases where the \( c_i \) are not all equal to one.; See also http://www.idav.ucdavis.edu/education/CAGDNotes/Bernstein-Polynomials.pdf ; Definition at line 22 of file RooBernstein.h.

A category is ""fundamental"", i.e., its value doesn't depend on the value of other objects. (Objects in datasets cannot depend on other objects' values, they need to be self-consistent.); A category object can be used to e.g. conduct a simultaneous fit of the same observable in multiple categories. Setting up a category. A category can be set up like this: RooCategory myCat(""myCat"", ""Lepton multiplicity category"", {; {""0Lep"", 0},; {""1Lep"", 1},; {""2Lep"", 2},; {""3Lep"", 3}; });; RooCategoryObject to represent discrete states.Definition RooCategory.h:28.

Each occurrence of split_arg is replaced with a clone of split_arg named split_arg_[MCstate], where [MCstate] is the name of the 'master category state' that indexes the clones to be built. Example: Change the decay constant of an exponential for each run; Splitting is particularly useful when building simultaneous fits to subsets of the data sample with different background properties. In such a case, the user builds a single prototype PDF representing the structure of the signal and background and splits the dataset into categories with different background properties. Using RooCustomizer a PDF for each subfit can be constructed from the prototype that has same structure and signal parameters, but different instances of the background parameters: e.g. ...; RooExponential bg(""bg"",""background"",x,alpha) ;; RooGaussian sig(""sig"",""signal"",x,mean,sigma) ;; RooAddPdf pdf(""pdf"",""pdf"",sig,bg,sigfrac) ;; ; RooDataSet data(""data"",""dataset"",RooArgSet(x,runblock),...); ; RooCategory runblock(""runblock"",""run block"") ;; runblock.defineType(""run1"") ;; runblock.defineType(""run2"") ;; ; RooArgSet splitLeaves;; RooCustomizer cust(pdf,runblock,splitLeaves);; cust.splitArg(alpha,runblock);; ; RooAbsPdf* pdf_run1 = cust.build(""run1"") ;; RooAbsPdf* pdf_run2 = cust.build(""run2"") ;; ; RooSimultaneous simpdf(""simpdf"",""simpdf"",RooArgS",MatchSource.WIKI,doc/master/classRooCustomizer.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooCustomizer.html
