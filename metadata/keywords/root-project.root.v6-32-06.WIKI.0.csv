You are hereHome » ROOT 6 Analysis Workshop 3. Examining a TTree's data. The TTree; A TTree is a collection of similar data. It is the collection used by basically all High Energy Physics data. Traditionally, each entry in a TTree corresponds to a collision event. (Notable exceptions at the LHC are ALICE and LHCb which have a different mapping of TTree entries.); T",MatchSource.WIKI,d/3-examining-ttrees-data.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/3-examining-ttrees-data.html

Instead of using the TBrowser you can also use C++:; tree->Draw(""muons.fPt""). This will again produce a histogram, now for the muons momentum. Note that MockupX is an imaginary but terrible experiment, its data doesn't make much sense - but for examining how to analyze it's just fine.; Selections; You define what data to draw (the muons' momentum in above example). But you might also want to not draw the value for all muons, but only for selected one - for example for those that have an electron in the event that has caused the experiment's trigger (""yes we want to keep this data!"") do fire. You do that with a second parameter:; tree->Draw(""muons.fPt"", ""electrons.fTriggered""). As you now restrict the drawn electrons to a subset of the original ones, you should see that there are less entries in the histogram. Did that work?; . ‹ 4. Histogramming; up; 5. Fitting ›.

You are hereHome » ROOT 6 Analysis Workshop 6. Multivariate Analysis. Multiple Variables; The muon trigger should fire more likely for higher muon momenta - let's check that!; For that we need to draw two variables: how many were fired and ho many were not, against the momentum of the muon. We could put the fired / not fired on the y-axis, and the muon momentum on the x-axis. You can do that with TTree::Draw(""yExpression:xExpression""). It should give you the top histogram above, where the y-axis has a value of 0 for not triggered muons and of 1 for triggered muons.; The default output puts one tiny dot at each point - which is fairly useless on our case. So specify as the third option to TTree::Draw() a different drawing option - we want ""BOX"" here, which should give the the second histogram with box sizes proportional to histogram bin entries.; This plot shows tha",MatchSource.WIKI,d/6-multivariate-analysis.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/6-multivariate-analysis.html

The efficiency is thus rising with pT. We will study this in more detail in the following steps.; Multivariate Analysis with TMVA; Now let's assume we want to see whether the muon trigger also depends on the muon X position, i.e. whether it fires more often for instance when the muon was created farther away from the beam pipe. This would mean that there is e.g. a linear correlation between the muon trigger and the position.; ROOT offers TMVA, a tool widely used in physics analyses for analyzing higher dimensional dependencies.

Ideally, these selections suppress all events that have no muon above this pT, and include all events with at least one muon that has more than the cut pT. The first image above shows an ideal selection efficiency: below the cutoff value (here, ""5"") it selects nothing (0% efficiency), above it selects everything (100% efficiency).; In reality, the efficiency is often rising more or less slowly from 0% efficiency to its maximum efficiency value - which is usually below 100%.

And so we would underestimate the all part.

The approach is called:; Tag and Probe; We take a random muon (the tag muon).

For an efficiency curve a TMath::Erf() is usually a good fit function. But you can't really use it as is. Let's see what it looks like:; // This lambda defines the values of the function. For now we don't use p:; auto myErf0Lambda = [](double* x, double* p) { return TMath::Erf(x[0]); };; // When drawing, show between -10..10; TF1* myErf0 = new TF1(""myErf0"", myErf0Lambda, -10, 10);; myErf0->Draw();. This is the same one but moved around to match the concept of efficiencies:; auto myErf1Lambda = [](double* x, double* p) ; { return (TMath::Erf((x[0]-5)/3) + 1)/2 * 0.8; };; TF1* myErf1 = new TF1(""myErf1"", myErf1Lambda, -10, 10);; myErf1->Draw();.

Try out what happens when you change the values for 5, 3 and 0.8 (simply by calling myErf2->SetParameter(...);)!; Fitting a TF1; Now that we have a nice TF1 we can fit it to the TEfficiency object by calling eff->Fit(). Here is the complete code you need to add to the end of effX():; ...; void effX() {; ...; auto effErf = [](double* x, double* p) {; return (TMath::Erf((x[0] - p[0]) / p[1]) + 1) / 2. * p[2];; };.

Parameter Initialization and Fitting; You must initialize the parameters to sensible values - this is especially important for higher dimensional fits, e.g. with a TF2. Fitting is magic, but only within limits. Try with completely bogus parameters and you'll see how the fit fails!; . ‹ 8. Efficiency Calculation; up; 10. Go Parallel! ›. Navigate through this book; 0.

Every day, thousands of physicists use ROOT applications to analyze their data or to perform simulations. With ROOT you can:. Save data You can save your data (and any C++ object) in a compressed binary form in a ROOT file. The object format is also saved in the same file: the ROOT files are self-descriptive. Even in the case the source files describing the data model are not available, the information contained in a ROOT file is be always readable. ROOT provides a data structure, the tree, that is extremely powerful for fast access of huge amounts of data - orders of magnitude faster than accessing a normal file.; Access data Data saved into one or several ROOT files can be accessed from your PC, from the web and from large-scale file delivery systems used e.g. in the GRID. ROOT trees spread over several files can be chained and accessed as a unique object, allowing for loops over huge amounts of data.; Mine data Powerful mathematical and statistical tools are provided to operate on your data. The full power of a C++ application and of parallel processing is available for any kind of data manipulation.

You are hereHome About ROOT. ROOT is a framework for data processing, born at CERN, at the heart of the research on high-energy physics. Every day, thousands of physicists use ROOT applications to analyze their data or to perform simulations. With ROOT you can:. Save data You can save your data (and any C++ object) in a compressed binary form in a ROOT file. The object format is also saved in the same file: the ROOT files are self-descriptive. Even in the case the source files describing the data model are not available, the information contained in a ROOT file is be always readable. ROOT provides a data structure, the tree, that is extremely powerful for fast access of huge amounts of data - orders of magnitude faster than accessing a normal file.; Access data Data saved into one or several ROOT files can be accessed from your PC, from the web and from large-scale file delivery systems used e.g. in the GRID. ROOT trees spread over several files can be chained and accessed as a unique object, allowing for loops over huge amounts of data.; Mine data Powerful mathematical and statistical tools are provided to operate on your data. The full power of a C++ application and of parallel processing is available for any kind of data manipulation. Data can also be generated following any statistical distribution and modeled, making it possible to simulate complex systems.; Publish results Results can be displayed with histograms, scatter plots, fitting functions. ROOT graphics may be adjusted real-time by few mouse clicks.

Figure 3: Distribution of ""fPosZ"" values; This graph is called a histogram: it counts occurrences, combining neighboring values into ""bins"". In this case we have 100 equally sized bins (the ""steps""), ranging from x=-74 to x=102. You can tell that there were about 500 particles with a fPosZ value around -11.

So lets see what we can do with this selector.; Editing the Selector Skeleton; Open the downloaded selector file (EventSelector.C) in a text editor, e.g. with vi, emacs, wordpad, Eclipse... At the beginning of the file is the EventSelector class definition with the data members declaration etc. This is the place where to add new member definitions, e.g. TH1 *fMyHist;. Then come the function implementations.; Creating a Data Member; Lets start with something simple: count the number of events in our tree. To do so, we need to create a data member of type int or Int_t, to store (increment) the event number. Lets call it fNumberOfEvents. Add its declaration in the class definition, and initialize it to 0 in the constructor:; class EventSelector : public TSelector {; public :; // Variables used to store the data; Int_t fNumberOfEvents; // Total number of events. EventSelector(TTree * = 0): fNumberOfEvents(0) { }; virtual ~EventSelector() { }. virtual void Init(TTree *tree);; ... The code : fNumberOfEvents(0) after the constructor is another way of initializing a data member. Then we have to count the total number of entries (events in our case) in the tree. This has to be done in TSelector::Process(Long64_t entry). We will print also the current entry number, to see what's happening:; Bool_t EventSelector::Process(Long64_t entry); {; // ... // print some information about the current entry; printf(""Processing Entry number %ld\n"", entry);; /",MatchSource.WIKI,d/accessing-ttree-tselector.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/accessing-ttree-tselector.html

Accessing the Analysis Result; In your selector's Terminate() function, print the sum of all event sizes. This sum shows you the real power of a TTree: even though you can analyze large amounts of data (our example tree with 22MB is tiny!) ROOT needs just a few MB of your RAM, no matter how many events you analyze. Imagine what it would be like if you had to load all data into memory, e.g. using a simple vector!; void EventSelector::Terminate(); {; // ... int sizeInMB = fTotalDataSize/1024/1024;; printf(""Total size of all events: %d MB\n"", sizeInMB);; }.

Execute the cmake command on the shell replacing path/to/source with the path to the top of your ROOT source tree:; $ cmake path/to/source. CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of test and generate the files required for building ROOT. CMake will use default values for all build parameters.

The --build option tells cmake to invoke the underlying build tool (make, ninja, xcodebuild, msbuild, etc).; The underlying build tool can also be invoked directly of course, but thecmake --build command is more portable.; On unix systems (with make or ninja) you can speedup the build with cmake --build . -- -jN where N is the number of available cores.; Setup the environment to run; $ source /path/to/install-or-build/dir/bin/thisroot.sh. Start ROOT interactive application; $ root. Installation methods; There are two main methods of installing ROOT from source: location independent and fix location. The former is advised for a personal installation of ROOT, while the later for a system wide installation. Both require to set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable at configuration time. The later requires in addition to set the gnuinstall option at configuration. It also allows the tuning of destinations for the various components, by setting the variablesCMAKE_INSTALL_xxxDIR, wherexxx isBIN,LIB,INCLUDE, etc. The full list is described in the variables section.; To use the location independent installation requires to set environment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Basic CMake Usage; This section explains basic aspects of CMake which you may need in your day-to-day usage.; CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as online help accessible via the cmake executable itself. Execute cmake --help for further help options.; CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio, or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your build tool, CMake uses the corresponding Generator to create files for your build tool (e.g., Makefiles or Visual Studio or Xcode project files). You can explicitly specify the generator with the command line option -G ""Name of the generator"". To see a list of the available generators on your system, execute; $ cmake --help. This will list the generator names at the end of the help text.; Generators’ names are case-sensitive, and may contain spaces. For this reason, you should enter them exactly as they are listed in the cmake --help output, in quotes. For example, to generate project files specifically for Visual Studio 12, you can execute:; $ cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12"" path/to/source. For a given development platform there can be more than one adequate generator. If you use Visual Studio, “NMake Makefiles” is a generator you can use for building with NMake. By default, CMake chooses the most specific generator supported by your development environment. If you want an alternative generator, you must tell this to CMake with the -G option.; Options and variables; Variables customize how the build will be generated. Options are boolean variables, with possible values ON/OFF. Options and variables are defined on the CMake command line like this:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE=v",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

See the Build Options and Variables sections for fine-tuning your build; This can fail if CMake can’t detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the environment is not sane enough. On this case make sure that the toolset that you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell and that the shell itself is the correct one for you development environment. You can force CMake to use a given build tool, see the Usage section.; After CMake has finished running, proceed to use IDE project files or start the build from the build directory:; $ cmake --build . [-- <options to the native tool>]. The --build option tells cmake to invoke the underlying build tool (make, ninja, xcodebuild, msbuild, etc).; The underlying build tool can also be invoked directly of course, but thecmake --build command is more portable.; On unix systems (with make or ninja) you can speedup the build with cmake --build . -- -jN where N is the number of available cores.; Setup the environment to run; $ source /path/to/install-or-build/dir/bin/thisroot.sh. Start ROOT interactive application; $ root. Installation methods; There are two main methods of installing ROOT from source: location independent and fix location. The former is advised for a personal installation of ROOT, while the later for a system wide installation. Both require to set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable at configuration time. The later requires in addition to set the gnuinstall option at configuration. It also allows the tuning of destinations for the various components, by setting the variablesCMAKE_INSTALL_xxxDIR, wherexxx isBIN,LIB,INCLUDE, etc. The full list is described in the variables section.; To use the location independent installation requires to set environment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Basic CMake Usage; This section explains basic aspects of CMake which you may need in your day-to-day usage.; CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as online help accessible via the cmake executable itself. Execute cmake --help for further help options.; CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio, or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your build tool, CMake uses the corresponding Generator to create files for your build t",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

If you use Visual Studio, “NMake Makefiles” is a generator you can use for building with NMake. By default, CMake chooses the most specific generator supported by your development environment. If you want an alternative generator, you must tell this to CMake with the -G option.; Options and variables; Variables customize how the build will be generated. Options are boolean variables, with possible values ON/OFF. Options and variables are defined on the CMake command line like this:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE=value path/to/source. You can set a variable after the initial CMake invocation to change its value. You can also undefine a variable:; $ cmake -UVARIABLE path/to/source. Variables are stored in the CMake cache. This is a file named CMakeCache.txt stored at the root of your build directory that is generated by cmake. Editing it yourself is not recommended.; Variables are listed in the CMake cache with the variable name and type separated by a colon. You can also specify the variable and type on the CMake command line:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE:TYPE=value path/to/source. Variables in the CMake cache are 'remembered', so you do not need to type them if you execute cmake command again. It is recommended to delete the file CMakeCache.txt to start from a clean configuration. Sitemap. DownloadDownload ROOT; All Releases.

https://root.cern/d/building-root.html:2913,Integrability,interface,interface,2913,"; ROOT uses the CMake cross-platform build-generator tool as a primary build system. CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by your build tool (GNU make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT. The classic build with configure/make is is still available but it will not be evolving with the new features of ROOT. The instructions can be found here.; If you are really anxious about getting a functional ROOT build, go to the Quick Start section. If you are a CMake novice, start on Basic CMake usage and then go back to the Quick Start once you know what you are doing. The Options and Variables section is a reference for customizing your build. If you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.; Preparation; Check the prerequisites and supported platforms for the list of packages needed for your setup before starting the build.; Quick Start; The following are the basic instructions for UNIX systems. We use here the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. Download and unpack the ROOT's sources from the download area or using directly the Git repository. Follow the instructions for getting the ROOT sources; Open a shell. Your development tools must be reachable from this shell through the PATH environment variable.; Create a directory for containing the build. It is not supported to build ROOT on the source directory. cd to this directory:; $ mkdir <builddir>; $ cd <builddir> . Execute the cmake command on the shell replacing path/to/source with the path to the top of your ROOT source tree:; $ cmake path/to/source. CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of test and generate the files required for building ROOT. CMake will use default values for all build parameters. See the Build Options and Variables sections for fine-tuning your build; This can fail if CMake can’t detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the environment is not sane enough. On this case make sure that the toolse",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

Start ROOT interactive application; $ root. Installation methods; There are two main methods of installing ROOT from source: location independent and fix location. The former is advised for a personal installation of ROOT, while the later for a system wide installation. Both require to set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable at configuration time. The later requires in addition to set the gnuinstall option at configuration. It also allows the tuning of destinations for the various components, by setting the variablesCMAKE_INSTALL_xxxDIR, wherexxx isBIN,LIB,INCLUDE, etc. The full list is described in the variables section.; To use the location independent installation requires to set environment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This is done by sourcing the script (depending on the shell family) source bin/thisroot.sh. While to use the fix location installation you do not need to set any environment to run root.; Do the installation of ROOT from the build directory:; $ cmake --build . --target install. The --target option with install parameter in addition to the --build option tells cmake to build the 'install' target. This is equivalent to make install for Unix systems. ; It is possible to set a different install prefix at installation time by invoking the cmake_install.cmake script generated in the build directory:; $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/root -P cmake_install.cmake. Build Options; Each build option is a boolean variable that can be turned ON or OFF. The current value is recorded in the CMake cache (CMakeCache.txt file on the build directory) and therefore it is not needed to be specified on the cmake command each time. Please note that some of the options might be turned OFF automatically for some platforms or if the required external l",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

You are hereHome » Documentation Building ROOT. Introduction; ROOT uses the CMake cross-platform build-generator tool as a primary build system. CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by your build tool (GNU make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT. The classic build with configure/make is is still available but it will not be evolving with the new features of ROOT. The instructions can be found here.; If you are really anxious about getting a functional ROOT build, go to the Quick Start section. If you are a CMake novice, start on Basic CMake usage and then go back to the Quick Start once you know what you are doing. The Options and Variables section is a reference for customizing your build. If you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.; Preparation; Check the prerequisites and supported platforms for the list of packages needed for your setup before starting the build.; Quick Start; The following are the basic instructions for UNIX systems. We use here the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. Download and unpack the ROOT's sources from the download area or using directly the Git repository.

CMake will look for these third party products at a number of standard places in your system but the user can influence the search by setting some environment variables before invoking the CMake command or by setting package specific CMake variables to their exact location.; The actual cached values used by CMake for the exact location of libraries and include files of the used external libraries can be inspected and modified using the ccmake utility.

Basic CMake Usage; This section explains basic aspects of CMake which you may need in your day-to-day usage.; CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as online help accessible via the cmake executable itself. Execute cmake --help for further help options.; CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio, or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your build tool, CMake uses the corresponding Generator to create files for your build t",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

You can explicitly specify the generator with the command line option -G ""Name of the generator"". To see a list of the available generators on your system, execute; $ cmake --help. This will list the generator names at the end of the help text.; Generators’ names are case-sensitive, and may contain spaces. For this reason, you should enter them exactly as they are listed in the cmake --help output, in quotes. For example, to generate project files specifically for Visual Studio 12, you can execute:; $ cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12"" path/to/source. For a given development platform there can be more than one adequate generator. If you use Visual Studio, “NMake Makefiles” is a generator you can use for building with NMake. By default, CMake chooses the most specific generator supported by your development environment. If you want an alternative generator, you must tell this to CMake with the -G option.; Options and variables; Variables customize how the build will be generated. Options are boolean variables, with possible values ON/OFF. Options and variables are defined on the CMake command line like this:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE=value path/to/source. You can set a variable after the initial CMake invocation to change its value. You can also undefine a variable:; $ cmake -UVARIABLE path/to/source. Variables are stored in the CMake cache. This is a file named CMakeCache.txt stored at the root of your build directory that is generated by cmake. Editing it yourself is not recommended.; Variables are listed in the CMake cache with the variable name and type separated by a colon. You can also specify the variable and type on the CMake command line:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE:TYPE=value path/to/source.

If you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.; Preparation; Check the prerequisites and supported platforms for the list of packages needed for your setup before starting the build.; Quick Start; The following are the basic instructions for UNIX systems. We use here the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. Download and unpack the ROOT's sources from the download area or using directly the Git repository. Follow the instructions for getting the ROOT sources; Open a shell. Your development tools must be reachable from this shell through the PATH environment variable.; Create a directory for containing the build. It is not supported to build ROOT on the source directory. cd to this directory:; $ mkdir <builddir>; $ cd <builddir> . Execute the cmake command on the shell replacing path/to/source with the path to the top of your ROOT source tree:; $ cmake path/to/source. CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of test and generate the files required for building ROOT. CMake will use default values for all build parameters. See the Build Options and Variables sections for fine-tuning your build; This can fail if CMake can’t detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the environment is not sane enough. On this case make sure that the toolset that you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell and that the shell itself is the correct one for you development environment. You can force CMake to use a given build tool, see the Usage section.; After CMake has finished running, proceed to use IDE project files or start the build from the build directory:; $ cmake --build . [-- <options to the native tool>]. The --build option tells cmake to invoke the underlying build tool (make, ninja, xcodebuild, msbuild, etc).; The underlying build tool can also be invoked directly of course, but thecmake --build command is more portable.; On unix systems (with make or ninja) you can speedup the bu",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

This is done by sourcing the script (depending on the shell family) source bin/thisroot.sh. While to use the fix location installation you do not need to set any environment to run root.; Do the installation of ROOT from the build directory:; $ cmake --build . --target install. The --target option with install parameter in addition to the --build option tells cmake to build the 'install' target. This is equivalent to make install for Unix systems. ; It is possible to set a different install prefix at installation time by invoking the cmake_install.cmake script generated in the build directory:; $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/root -P cmake_install.cmake. Build Options; Each build option is a boolean variable that can be turned ON or OFF. The current value is recorded in the CMake cache (CMakeCache.txt file on the build directory) and therefore it is not needed to be specified on the cmake command each time.

Basic CMake Usage; This section explains basic aspects of CMake which you may need in your day-to-day usage.; CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as online help accessible via the cmake executable itself. Execute cmake --help for further help options.; CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio, or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your build tool, CMake uses the corresponding Generator to create files for your build tool (e.g., Makefiles or Visual Studio or Xcode project files). You can explicitly specify the generator with the command line option -G ""Name of the generator"". To see a list of the available generators on your system, execute; $ cmake --help. This will list the generator names at the end of the help text.; Generators’ names are case-sensitive, and may contain spaces. For this reason, you should enter them exactly as they are listed in the cmake --help output, in quotes. For example, to generate project files specifically for Visual Studio 12, you can execute:; $ cmake -G ",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

You are hereHome » Documentation Building ROOT. Introduction; ROOT uses the CMake cross-platform build-generator tool as a primary build system. CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by your build tool (GNU make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT. The classic build with configure/make is is still available but it will not be evolving with the new features of ROOT. The instructions can be found here.; If you are really anxious about getting a functional ROOT build, go to the Quick Start section. If you are a CMake novice, start on Basic CMake usage and then go back to the Quick Start once you know what you are doing. The Options and Variables section is a reference for customizing your build. If you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.; Preparation; Check the prerequisites and supported plat",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

If you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.; Preparation; Check the prerequisites and supported platforms for the list of packages needed for your setup before starting the build.; Quick Start; The following are the basic instructions for UNIX systems. We use here the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. Download and unpack the ROOT's sources from the download area or using directly the Git repository. Follow the instructions for getting the ROOT sources; Open a shell. Your development tools must be reachable from this shell through the PATH environment variable.; Create a directory for containing the build. It is not supported to build ROOT on the source directory. cd to this directory:; $ mkdir <builddir>; $ cd <builddir> . Execute the cmake command on the shell replacing path/to/source with the path to the top of your ROOT source tree:; $ cmake path/to/source. CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of test and generate the files required for building ROOT. CMake will use default values for all build parameters. See the Build Options and Variables sections for fine-tuning your build; This can fail if CMake can’t detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the environment is not sane enough. On this case make sure that the toolset that you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell and that the shell itself is the correct one for you development environment. You can force CMake to use a given build tool, see the Usage section.; After CMake has finished running, proceed to use IDE project files or start the build from the build directory:; $ cmake --build . [-- <options to the native tool>]. The --build option tells cmake to invoke the underlying build tool (make, ninja, xcodebuild, msbuild, etc).; The underlying build tool can also be invoked directly of course, but thecmake --build command is more portable.; On unix systems (with make or ninja) you can speedup the bu",MatchSource.WIKI,d/building-root.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/building-root.html

If you use Visual Studio, “NMake Makefiles” is a generator you can use for building with NMake. By default, CMake chooses the most specific generator supported by your development environment. If you want an alternative generator, you must tell this to CMake with the -G option.; Options and variables; Variables customize how the build will be generated. Options are boolean variables, with possible values ON/OFF. Options and variables are defined on the CMake command line like this:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE=value path/to/source. You can set a variable after the initial CMake invocation to change its value. You can also undefine a variable:; $ cmake -UVARIABLE path/to/source. Variables are stored in the CMake cache. This is a file named CMakeCache.txt stored at the root of your build directory that is generated by cmake. Editing it yourself is not recommended.; Variables are listed in the CMake cache with the variable name and type separated by a colon.

If you use Visual Studio, “NMake Makefiles” is a generator you can use for building with NMake. By default, CMake chooses the most specific generator supported by your development environment. If you want an alternative generator, you must tell this to CMake with the -G option.; Options and variables; Variables customize how the build will be generated. Options are boolean variables, with possible values ON/OFF. Options and variables are defined on the CMake command line like this:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE=value path/to/source. You can set a variable after the initial CMake invocation to change its value. You can also undefine a variable:; $ cmake -UVARIABLE path/to/source. Variables are stored in the CMake cache. This is a file named CMakeCache.txt stored at the root of your build directory that is generated by cmake. Editing it yourself is not recommended.; Variables are listed in the CMake cache with the variable name and type separated by a colon. You can also specify the variable and type on the CMake command line:; $ cmake -DVARIABLE:TYPE=value path/to/source. Variables in the CMake cache are 'remembered', so you do not need to type them if you execute cmake command again.

Then the protected members and methods and finally the public methods (no public data members). We put private members first since that is the language default and it gives the developer a quick view on what data members are used in a class.; Avoid raw C types; Avoid the use of raw C types like int, long, float, double when using data that might be written to disk. For example, the sizes of int and long are machine dependent. On 32 bit machines ints and longs are 32 bits, but on 64 bit processors an int can be either 32 or 64 bits and a long 64 bits, depending on the processor. For portability reasons and consistent numerical results use the typedefs provided by ROOT's Rtypes.h for the basic raw C types. E.g.: Double_t, Float_t, Int_t etc.; Exception handling; Don't let every method throw an exception when a simple error return code is often enough.; Namespaces; In ROOT 5 all classes are in the ROOT namespace. Some packages will be in a sub-namespace, e.g. ROOT::Reflex. For backward compatibility with the previous versions of ROOT, where all classes were in the global namespace, we have by default using namespace ROOT; in all headers. However, this can be turned off by defining the USE_ROOT_NAMESPACE macro.; Using comments to document the code; ROOT chose Doxygen for its code documentation: please refer to this how-to for all the details.; Source file layout; Each source file, header or implementation file starts with a module identification line and an author line, e.g.:; / @(#)root/net / Author: Fons Rademakers 18/12/96 ; Where in the module identification line the file package is described by root/package, in this case the net package.; Header file layout; Each header file has the following layout:.

Then the protected members and methods and finally the public methods (no public data members). We put private members first since that is the language default and it gives the developer a quick view on what data members are used in a class.; Avoid raw C types; Avoid the use of raw C types like int, long, float, double when using data that might be written to disk. For example, the sizes of int and long are machine dependent. On 32 bit machines ints and longs are 32 bits, but on 64 bit processors an int can be either 32 or 64 bits and a long 64 bits, depending on the processor. For portability reasons and consistent numerical results use the typedefs provided by ROOT's Rtypes.h for the basic raw C types. E.g.: Double_t, Float_t, Int_t etc.; Exception handling; Don't let every method throw an exception when a simple error return code is often enough.; Namespaces; In ROOT 5 all classes are in the ROOT namespace. Some packages will be in a sub-namespace, e.g. ROOT::Reflex. For backward compatibility with the previous versions of ROOT, where all classes were in the global namespace, we have by default using namespace ROOT; in all headers. However, this can be turned off by defining the USE_ROOT_NAMESPACE macro.; Using comments to document the code; ROOT chose Doxygen for its code documentation: please refer to this how-to for all the details.; Source file layout; Each source file, header or implementation file starts with a module identification line and an author line, e.g.:; / @(#)root/net / Author: Fons Rademakers 18/12/96 ; Where in the module identification line the file package is described by root/package, in this case the net package.; Header file layout; Each header file has the following layout:.

Of course you will be duly credited and your name will appear on the contributors page and in the CREDITS file shipped with every binary and source distribution. The copyright transfer is necessary for us to be able to effectively defend the project in case of litigation.; Presently, there are two ways in which you can contribute:; 1. Via the Users' contribution section in the Forum; The Users' Forum has a section which describes how to submit contributions. It is the easiest way to make your code known to the community, even if it will not be automatically integrated in ROOT. Of course the most successful contributions will become part of the repository!; 2. Sending Patches; You can send us a patch or a pull request with Github, provided that you follow these two simple rules:. Make sure you follow the ROOT coding conventions in your code; Make sure you provide a set of tests for your feature/bug fix. Often it is useful to contact us first to discuss the code you want to develop or the bug you want to fix.; Picking up an Idea; We maintain a set of ""ideas"" for talented scientists and developers to pick up. An ""idea"" is a sketch of a development project, a functionality a missing feature we would like to see in our tool, in your ROOT! You can inspect the ideas in the following list. Ideas. ; 30-01-2019 ; Transform GNU-makefile tests to CMake; ROOT's test suite has several crucial tests that still try on GNU-Makefile. We need to integrate them with CMake. ; 30-01-2019 ; Better argument parsing; Use a C++ command line argument library for defining and parsing ROOT's options. ; 30-01-2019 ; More tests, more benchmarks!; ROOT relies on testing, including performance testing - and we need to improve both.",MatchSource.WIKI,d/collaborate-with-us.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/collaborate-with-us.html

Windows: Why must debug (non-debug) compiled code be linked against debug (non-debug) ROOT? . Microsoft's STL classes (std::string, std::vector,...) are different for debug and optimized mode. When calling a ROOT function that expects a STL object as an argument, the caller (e.g. your code) and ROOT must agree on what the object looks like. Thus if you link against ROOT libraries built as debug (non-debug) you must also compile your code as debug (non-debug). ACLiC does that automatically for you. ; .

Note that you must copy the entire repository, since all the important information is in the .git directory tree at the top level. Stashing; This is a good way quickly to get a clean tree if you want to merge or rebase (see below) to import changes from a branch without having to commit your current work. Save uncommitted changes to the current working area to the stash (not a commit operation):; git stash. Apply previously-saved stash:; git stash pop. (pops off the changes and applies them to the current working area) or; git stash apply. which applies the changes but retains them on the stack.; Examine the current state of the stash:; git stash list. Clear the entire stash:; git stash clear. Rebasing; Rebasing is changing history, if you think that git stores history. As mentioned above, it doesn't: it saves objects with parent, child and other (eg date, author, etc) information. In a truly distributed environment, the actual history will be different for every repository depending exactly how and when changes were fetched, merged or pushed.; Rebasing is a good way to do a couple of things:. ""Squash"" related commits in your local repository prior to a push (eg, ""Implement feature X,"" ""Tests for feature X"" and, ""Fix bugs found while testing feature X"").; Simplify merging branches and keeping up-to-date with remote changes during long periods between pushes. Important tip: do not attempt to rebase anything that has already been pushed to a remote repository. Your next push will almost certainly fail (and quite right too). Squashing related commits:. Squash some of the last few commits in your current branch:; git rebase -i HEAD~5. Your configured editor (VISUAL or EDITOR) will be started and contain a list of your last five commits (most recent at the bottom) along with instructions on what to do.

In a truly distributed environment, the actual history will be different for every repository depending exactly how and when changes were fetched, merged or pushed.; Rebasing is a good way to do a couple of things:. ""Squash"" related commits in your local repository prior to a push (eg, ""Implement feature X,"" ""Tests for feature X"" and, ""Fix bugs found while testing feature X"").; Simplify merging branches and keeping up-to-date with remote changes during long periods between pushes. Important tip: do not attempt to rebase anything that has already been pushed to a remote repository. Your next push will almost certainly fail (and quite right too). Squashing related commits:. Squash some of the last few commits in your current branch:; git rebase -i HEAD~5. Your configured editor (VISUAL or EDITOR) will be started and contain a list of your last five commits (most recent at the bottom) along with instructions on what to do.

Unlike CVS and SVN, every local working area is also a repository.; Unlike CVS and SVN, repositories are not sub-divisible: in the former systems, one can easily check out only a subsection of a package; with git, it's all-or-nothing.; A repository may have zero or more remote repositories to which items may be pushed (or from which they may be retrieved): Git is a truly distributed system.; Branches are easy to create, merge and destroy.; The, ""unit of change"" is a commit, labeled by its SHA1 hash. A tree's, ""state"" is a collection of commits. Merging branches multiple times is therefore trivial because it consists of comparing commit lists.; Git commit trees do not record history: they record changes. A simple change has one parent.

In general, you will probably prefer annotated tags with version-branches created explicitly as desired.; Push the tag to the remote:; git push --tags. Special notes on mis-tagging.; There are several things that can go wrong with tagging:. One can omit an intended -a option;; One can misspell the tag; or; One can omit or (horror!) fix a file and wish to update the tag. If you have not pushed tags yet (See above) then the fix is trivial: for the first two cases, remove the erroneous tag with git tag -d <tag>; for the third, re-tag with git tag -am <mesasge> [<tree-ish>]. However, if you have already pushed tags, there are wider consequences. For this reason, altering pushed tags is emphatically discouraged: create a new tag. However, since you're going to ignore me and do it anyway, here's how to do what you want without getting into too much of a mess:. To remove an erroneous tag, someone with the manager rôle on the project must log into cdcvsdirectly as the repository user (e.g. p-art), cd to the bare repository with cd /cvs/projects/<project> and then remove the tag with git tag -d <tag>.; Back in your working directory, tag correctly and then push tags.; Now, you must alert all your developers that, if they have pulled the erroneous tag to their local repository, they will need to remove the tag from their local repository with git -d <tag> and then re-pull from the repository. Otherwise, deleted tags will keep re-appearing in the remote repository and/or users will be unable to pull or push to the remote. Undo the last commit:. Undo the commit:; git reset --soft HEAD^. Do stuff.; Recommit:; git commit -a -m <message> -c ORIG_HEAD. Note that the -c ORIG_HEAD clause causes git to use the meta-data from the previous HEAD (author, etc) with the exception of the commit message.

Unlike CVS and SVN, every local working area is also a repository.; Unlike CVS and SVN, repositories are not sub-divisible: in the former systems, one can easily check out only a subsection of a package; with git, it's all-or-nothing.; A repository may have zero or more remote repositories to which items may be pushed (or from which they may be retrieved): Git is a truly distributed system.; Branches are easy to create, merge and destroy.; The, ""unit of change"" is a commit, labeled by its SHA1 hash. A tree's, ""state"" is a collection of commits. Merging branches multiple times is therefore trivial because it consists of comparing commit lists.; Git commit trees do not record history: they record changes. A simple change has one parent. Creating a branch creates another child of the parent commit; and a non-trivial merge joins two branches -- the resulting commit has two parents. Git (very) basics; Getting help. man git; git help <command>; man git-<command>; The git community book; Pragmatic Guide to Git; Google. Glossary. Add: put a file (or particular changes thereto) into the index ready for a commit operation. Optional for modifications to tracked files; mandatory for hitherto un-tracked files.; Alias shorthand for a git (or external) command, stored in a .gitconfig file.; Branch: a divergent change tree (eg a patch branch) which can me merged either wholesale or piecemeal with the master tree.; Commit: save the current state of the index and/or other specified files to the local repository.; Commit object: an object which contains the information about a particular revision, such as parents, committer, author, date and the tree object which corresponds to the top directory of the stored revision",MatchSource.WIKI,d/git-tips-and-tricks.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html
https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html:6060,Usability,simpl,simple,6060,"-rebase option is used).; Push: transfer the state of the current branch to a remote tracking branch. This must be a fast-forward operation (see merge).; Rebase: a merge-like operation in which the change tree is rewritten (see Rebasing below). Used to turn non-trivial merges into fast-forward operations.; Ref: a 40-byte hex representation of a SHA1 or a name that denotes a particular object.; Remote: another repository known to this one. If the local repository was created with ""clone"" then there is at least one remote, usually called, ""origin.""; Stage: to add a file or selected changes therefrom to the index in preparation for a commit.; Stash: a stack onto which the current set of uncommitted changes can be put (eg in order to switch to or synchronize with another branch) as a patch for retrieval later. Also the act of putting changes onto this stack.; Tag: human-readable label for a particular state of the tree. Tags may be simple (in which case they are actually branches) or annotated (analogous to a CVS tag), with an associated SHA1 hash and message. Annotated tags are preferable in general.; Tracking branch: a branch on a remote which is the default source / sink for pull / push operations respectively for the current branch. For instance, origin/master is the tracking branch for the local master in a local repository.; Tree-ish: a ref pointing to either a commit object, a tree object, or a tag object pointing to a tag or commit or tree object.; Un-tracked: not known currently to git. Initializing a repository; git clone <repository-spec> <local-dir>. or; mkdir <local-dir>; cd <local-dir>; git init. or (FNAL Redmine-specific); rclone [-r <repo>] <project> <local-name>. where rclone is defined in cet-chg:export:unix-admin/profile.d/rclone.sh ; Basic log information.>; git log []. Important tip: log messages have an optional structure, since many git commands only look at the first line. Get into the habit of putting only a short synopsis on the first line of a ",MatchSource.WIKI,d/git-tips-and-tricks.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html
https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html:11058,Usability,clear,clear,11058,"s:; git push --all. Some more advanced operations. Important tip: if you're going to do a git operation the outcome of which is even remotely uncertain to be the desired one: make a copy of your repository:; mkdir -p <path-to-safe-dir>; tar -cf - . | tar -xC <path-to-safe-dir>. Disk space is cheap and rm -rf is easy. Note that you must copy the entire repository, since all the important information is in the .git directory tree at the top level. Stashing; This is a good way quickly to get a clean tree if you want to merge or rebase (see below) to import changes from a branch without having to commit your current work. Save uncommitted changes to the current working area to the stash (not a commit operation):; git stash. Apply previously-saved stash:; git stash pop. (pops off the changes and applies them to the current working area) or; git stash apply. which applies the changes but retains them on the stack.; Examine the current state of the stash:; git stash list. Clear the entire stash:; git stash clear. Rebasing; Rebasing is changing history, if you think that git stores history. As mentioned above, it doesn't: it saves objects with parent, child and other (eg date, author, etc) information. In a truly distributed environment, the actual history will be different for every repository depending exactly how and when changes were fetched, merged or pushed.; Rebasing is a good way to do a couple of things:. ""Squash"" related commits in your local repository prior to a push (eg, ""Implement feature X,"" ""Tests for feature X"" and, ""Fix bugs found while testing feature X"").; Simplify merging branches and keeping up-to-date with remote changes during long periods between pushes. Important tip: do not attempt to rebase anything that has already been pushed to a remote repository. Your next push will almost certainly fail (and quite right too). Squashing related commits:. Squash some of the last few commits in your current branch:; git rebase -i HEAD~5. Your configured editor",MatchSource.WIKI,d/git-tips-and-tricks.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html
https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html:13753,Usability,simpl,simple,13753,"t in a conflict during the application of a particular change from the remote branch. Follow the on-screen instructions to resolve problems. This will usually consist of doing a git status to list conflicts, editing the files and using git add to mark each conflict resolved. The process must either be allowed to continue by issuing a git rebase --continue or git merge --continue command, or the operation can be reverted with --abort instead of --continue. If in doubt, copy your repository.; Making a new remote branch. Create a new local branch based on an existing one:; git checkout -b <branch>. Do stuff.; Push the branch to the remote:; git push <remote> <local-branch-name>[:<new-remote-branch-name>]. Tagging. Tag the current state of a branch (eg for release):; git tag -am <message> <version>. Note that the -a creates an annotated tag, which is itself a commit with a hash and a commit message. This is the closest analogue to the CVS tag command. Omitting the -a option will create a, ""simple tag"" which is actually a branch. In general, you will probably prefer annotated tags with version-branches created explicitly as desired.; Push the tag to the remote:; git push --tags. Special notes on mis-tagging.; There are several things that can go wrong with tagging:. One can omit an intended -a option;; One can misspell the tag; or; One can omit or (horror!) fix a file and wish to update the tag. If you have not pushed tags yet (See above) then the fix is trivial: for the first two cases, remove the erroneous tag with git tag -d <tag>; for the third, re-tag with git tag -am <mesasge> [<tree-ish>]. However, if you have already pushed tags, there are wider consequences. For this reason, altering pushed tags is emphatically discouraged: create a new tag. However, since you're going to ignore me and do it anyway, here's how to do what you want without getting into too much of a mess:. To remove an erroneous tag, someone with the manager rôle on the project must log into cdcvsd",MatchSource.WIKI,d/git-tips-and-tricks.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html
https://root.cern/d/git-tips-and-tricks.html:16021,Usability,simpl,simple,16021," from their local repository with git -d <tag> and then re-pull from the repository. Otherwise, deleted tags will keep re-appearing in the remote repository and/or users will be unable to pull or push to the remote. Undo the last commit:. Undo the commit:; git reset --soft HEAD^. Do stuff.; Recommit:; git commit -a -m <message> -c ORIG_HEAD. Note that the -c ORIG_HEAD clause causes git to use the meta-data from the previous HEAD (author, etc) with the exception of the commit message. Changing the -c to -C and omitting the -m option will cause git to reuse the commit message too. Recover deleted (committed files). Get a list of all commits with deleted files:; git log --diff-filter=D --summary | less. Find your file and note the SHA1 hash for that commit.; Recover it:; git checkout <commit>^ -- file. Stage selected changes within a file. git add --patch ; Follow the on-screen directions. Tig: a simple and colored text-mode interface for Git; Tig is a command line tool that wraps many Git browse operations (like log, diff, show, status) in a colored text-mode interface based on ncurses. Tig has been written by Jonas Fonseca.; See the full Tig manual for a detailed description.; Obtaining Tig; Tig is available as package from many Linux distributions. On Debian/Ubuntu it is available with the package name tig from the default repositories.; On RHEL-based systems it is available from the additional repository RepoForge.; On OS X it is easily installed via Homebrew:; brew install tig. Tig pager mode; Many git commands can be piped into tig. When tig is invoked this way, it is in pager mode: output will be colored according to the input format, and colored.; For instance it is possible to pipe the differences of one file like this:; git diff path/to/file.cxx | tig. or see the changes of one revision like this:; git show b204d4c87 | tig.

If this is too difficult, consult the release and development notes to check if your problem has not already been solved.; Try to quickly search the internet and look in the forum if your problem has been already solved.; Try to share the maximum amount of information. A bug report which only says ""My macro crashes when running on kubuntu but on windows works"" is much less likely to be solved quickly than a complete message with a gdb stacktrace and a reproducer (see next item).; Send a minimal program or macro reproducing the problem.

Preparation; Start from the previously used macro (AnalyzeTree.C).; Adding a Variable; Just like for the sum of event sizes, you need to add a variable in your macro. We want to histogram the particles' fPosX; the type of the data member should thus be TH1F *. TH1F is a 1 dimensional",MatchSource.WIKI,d/histogramming.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/histogramming.html
https://root.cern/d/histogramming.html:3372,Usability,simpl,simple,3372,"nt size sum.; Creating the Histogram; You then create the object with new TH1F(""hPosX"", ""Position in X"", 20, -5, 5);; Associate error bars with this histogram (see TH1F::Sumw2()); Filling the Histogram; The goal is to fill the histogram with the value of fPosX from the tree for all particles with a momentum > 40. You will need access to the particles' total momentum and their X position. Each TTree entry has several particles; it's thus easiest to use one TTreeReaderArray each for these Double_t values, for instance TTreeReaderArray particlesMomentum(myReader, ""fParticles.fMomentum"");. The TTreeReaderArray works just like the TTreeReaderValue we have used before, but gives you access to the number of particles using particlesMomentum.GetSize() and the n-th particle using the particlesMomentum[n] operator.; The analysis happens in loops. The outer loop is iterating through the TTree entries, using the TTreeReader::Next() loop - just as before. For each TTree entry, loop over all particles of the TTree entry with a simple for loop. For each particle, check that its momentum is > 40; if it is, fill the histogram (see TH1F::Fill()) with the fPosX value of that particle.; This step involves writing some code (similar to the code you have for the event size). If you get lost (SPOILER ALERT!): the solution is at the end of this page.; Fitting and Drawing the Histogram; Once the histogram is filled, fit it with a pol2 using TH1::Fit(""pol2""). Here ""pol2"" is ROOT's short name for ""polynomial of 2nd degree"", i.e. [0] + [1]x + [2]x*x, aka ""parabola"".; ""Fitting"" means using a function (in this case the pol2) with one or more free parameters ([0]..[2] in this case) and looking for those values of the parameters that result in the function passing as closely as possible through the data points, where ""close"" takes the points' uncertainties into account. You should first fit and then draw, to see the fit together with the histogram.; At the end, you should get something like this:.

See the following figure: ; For each individual build (select one cell in the matrix) the following information is provided:. Status. Shows a summary of the build (changes, errors, warnings, git revision, test results, etc.); Changes. Shows the details about the changes since the last build.; Console Output/View as plain text. Shows the full log of the build including all the steps (checkout, configuration, build, running tests, etc.); Parsed Console Output. The same as previous but with warnings and errors selected.; Parameters. The parameters used for the job.; Environment variables. A table with all the environment variables defined for the job.; Test Result. An interface to the CTest tests results. All test, failing and not failing can be shown with their output. Starting and stopping jobs. New jobs can be launched at any time independently of their automatic scheduling (time based or triggered by changes in the GIT repository). This is done by selecting Build with Parameters from the selected project page. This only enabled when your are logged in. Typically the default parameters should be sufficient unless you want to launch a special job.; Jobs (single or multi-configuration) can be stopped by pressing the small cross in the job build history or in the job status page.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion; of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and; distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1; above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:. a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,; in the event an application does not supply such function or; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of; its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the; application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any; application-supplied function or table used by this function must; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square; root function must still compute square roots.).

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS; ; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries. If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest; possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that; everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting; redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the; ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is; safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively; convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the; ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does>; Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>.

If you link other code with the library, you must provide; complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them; with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling; it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the; library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal; permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that; there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is; modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know; that what they have is not the original version, so that the original; author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be; introduced by others.; ; Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of; any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot; effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a; restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that; any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be; consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the; ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser; General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and; is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use; this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those; libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using; a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a; combined work, a derivative of the original library.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the; users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is; linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run; that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and; modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a; ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library"".

A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data; prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs; (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work; which has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based on the; Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under; copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a; portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated; straightforwardly into another language.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy; from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the; source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to; distribute the source code, even though third parties are not; compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5.

The ROOT system is being made available under the LGPL 2.1 or (at your option) any later version, which allows ROOT to be used in a wide range of open and closed environments.

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for; you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis; or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave; you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source; code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide; complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them; with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling; it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the; library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal; permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that; there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is; modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know; that what they have is not the original version, so that the original; author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be; introduced by others.; ; Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of; any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot; effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a; restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that; any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be; consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the; ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser; General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and; is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any; particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,; and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any; patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any; such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the; integrity of the free software distribution system which is; implemented by public license practices. Many people have made; generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed; through that system in reliance on consistent application of that; system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing; to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot; impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to; be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in; certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the; original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add; an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,; so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus; excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if; written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new; versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.; Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,; but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library; specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and; ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and; conditions either of that version or of any later version published by; the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a; license version number, you may choose any version ever published by; the Free Software Foundation.; ; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free; programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,; write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is; copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free; Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our; decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status; of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing; and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY. 15.

For more information about TFile, see its documentation at http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TFile.html; This file contains a TTree, as you can see by typing .ls in the ROOT prompt:. Figure 1: screenshot of the .ls command. As you can see, the TTree is called ""EventTree"". To inspect what's inside this tree, just type:; root[0] EventTree->Print().

The TTree contains a branch event, which in turn contains the branches fParticles and fEventSize. It simply reflects the layout of class EventData. Each TTree entry has one object of type class EventData, which in turn has a collection of particles. Each tree entry can have a different number of particles. There are 200 TTree entries containing a total of 22994 particles.; If you are curious how we generated the TTree: the script is in our git repository.; . ‹ Introductory Tutorials; up; Accessing a TTree With a TBrowser ›.

The following people have been working on ROOT for some time in their career and ROOT would not be what it is without their contributions:; Andrei Gheata; Andrei works since 2001 in the offline group of the ALICE experiment. He is an experimental nuclear physicist who worked before ALICE on data analysis for heavy-ion experiments in emulsions. In 2000 he started collaborating with the ROOT project and implemented the TreeViewer interface. Andrei is the main developer of the ROOT geometry package. He integrated the geometry in the Virtual Monte Carlo framework by developing interfaces for the GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA particle transport engines.; Anna Kreshuk; Anna was a project associate and contributed to different parts of ROOT, most notably to the fitting machinery, the interface to FFTW, numerous math-related functio",MatchSource.WIKI,d/previous-developers.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/previous-developers.html

He developed the first version of the HTML documentation system (THtml) and worked on the first version of the 3D graphics system. Nenad left in 1997.; Paul Russo; Paul joined the ROOT team at Fermilab in 2005 and has been focusing on support and developing CINT.; Pere Mato; Pere Mato was the project leader from 2014 to 2017. He was the driving force behind ROOT's migration to CMake and has contributed to PyROOT.; Richard Maunder; Richard worked as project associate on the 3D graphics OpenGL based system.; Susan Panacek; Susan wrote the first ROOT User's Guide and developed a number of ROOT tutorials.; Timur Pocheptsov; Timur worked as a project associate on many different aspects of ROOT, but mostly on the OpenGL accelerated 3D graphics and the native macOS Cocoa based GUI. Timur also ported ROOT to the iPad. He continues to maintain the OpenGL and Cocoa code till this day.; Valeri Fine; Valeri was a member of the ROOT team from 1998-2000. He made the initial port to Windows. Currently he is the maintainer of the ROOT-Qt interface.; Valeri Onuchin; Valeri worked as a project associate on many different aspects of ROOT, but mostly in the GUI and graphics area. He did develop the signal/slot functionality and the GUI builder. He also developed the Carrot ROOT enabled web server. Sitemap. DownloadDownload ROOT; All Releases.

In 1995, while working as Linux evangelist for Hewlett-Packard at CERN, he started with Rene Brun the ROOT project and has been involved in all aspects of the system since then. In 2001 Fons joined the ALICE collaboration and has worked as software architect on the initial version of the AliRoot framework. In recent years his special attention has gone to high performance parallel computing using PROOF. Fons took over from Rene Brun as ROOT project leader in 2011 and has led the project till 2014, culminating in the release of ROOT 6.; ; . Sitemap. DownloadDownload ROOT; All Releases.

You are hereHome » Documentation » Courses » Introductory Tutorials Using a Macro to Read a TTree. Why using a macro?; As real analyses don't fit into simple TTree::Draw() invocations, and as it is quite cumbersome to type the same lines again and again in the Root prompt, simply create macros for commonly used code. A macro is a file that is interpreted by ROOT.; Creating and Editing the Macro; Create a macro (e.g. AnalyzeTree.C) using your favorite text editor, e.g. with vi, emacs, wordpad, Eclipse, Visual Studio,... The macro should start with the proper #include statements and should contain the function declaration with the same name than the macro itself. As we know we're going to use TFile and TTree (at least), we can already include their headers TFile.h and TTree.h. Then come the function implementation.; Function Implementation; Lets start with something simple: calculate the sum of all event sizes. For this we need a new variable of type int. Create (declare) it at the beginning of the function, and don't forget to initialize it to 0.

You are hereHome » Blogs » Axel Naumann's blog Do we need yet another custom C++ interpreter?. Axel Naumann on Thu, 12/22/2011 - 22:13 . Hi,; ""A ROOT User"" asks ""Is it really necessary to replace CINT dictionary with cling?"", bringing up very reasonable concerns and arguments against re-implementing CINT. I will try to answer his comments to clarify why we do it, and how it connects with the rest.; A fundamental misconception is that the status quo is acceptable. It is not, for several reasons.; CINT vs C++; 	CINT was designed (20 years ago!) to be a C interpreted; C++ support was added later. It still has many shortcomings with C++ 2003, let alone C++11.; CINT maintenance; 	The original author of CINT, Masaharu Goto, has moved on; CINT has been maintained mainly by the ROOT team. It has 300k lines of code; that's a considerable fraction of ROOT's 2.5MLOC. It has been designed to fit into an integrated processing unit of appliances (like medical ones) - not for 16GB RAM, 8 compute thread, 50000 class environments.; Reflex and GCCXML solve it; 	ATLAS, CMS and LHCb use GCCXML to parse their headers, a set of python scripts to parse the generated XML file and write a C++ source file, the Reflex dictionary, which then gets compiled, linked, loaded, its data injected into the Reflex reflection database, which then gets copied through Cintex into CINT. We have thus many duplications of strings (three in the worst case with Reflex) and conflicts between duplicate dictionaries in Reflex versus CINT (famous: ""std::map<std::string, TH1*>"" must not be described through Reflex). On top of that, GCCXML is a limited parser (e.g. it swallows typedefs in certain conditions, think Double32_t); as it uses the GCC pa",MatchSource.WIKI,d/blog/do-we-need-yet-another-custom-c-interpreter.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/d/blog/do-we-need-yet-another-custom-c-interpreter.html

On top of that, GCCXML is a limited parser (e.g. it swallows typedefs in certain conditions, think Double32_t); as it uses the GCC parser this will not be fixed. I.e. the current setup is fragile, inefficient, and limiting.; CINT is not relevant, I use PyROOT; 	For calling into C++, PyROOT relies on CINT's reflection data from ROOT (which is why it's so fantastic compared to static SWIG-based approaches). And ROOT relies on CINT for I/O, both the dictionaries and the interpreter. I.e. you use CINT much, much more than you think: it's not just the prompt, it in the core of most of ROOT.;  ; So we need to do something. C++ interpreters are extremely rare. Instead of rewriting a C++ interpreter we decided to reuse existing code. Code that we can still influence, but that's nevertheless production-grade. We expected that this will solve the maintenance and correctness issues. And because it's correct we don't need Reflex, but can instead use one central, fast (compiler!) reflection database.; So yes, this is a major overhaul of ROOT and the dictionaries. We will signal that with a new major ROOT version number. But we expect it to solve the correctness, stability, memory and CPU-consumption as well as the maintenance issues we currently have. The current implementation of cling (which is not yet complete) uses a mere 5000 lines of custom code developed by HEP; everything else is provided through LLVM and clang.; And regarding PyROOT: I am sure Wim will make good use of the new JIT power that comes with cling! Just like we expect the JIT to leave traces e.g. in TFormula, and the real reflection database in the I/O, THtml etc. It gets us unstuck, flexible and future-safe in many central areas of ROOT.

I noticed that there are multiple other ways to call C++ code from Python, one of them being included in the Boost library. What would it do to the complexity (and dependencies) to use an interface that doesn't build on top of CINT/Reflex?.

So the cost is both on the implementation side and the feature side. Thus why not simply use PyROOT? :-); Note that we will soon have a PyROOT that builds on top of clang, as part of ROOT 6. I think Wim (the author of PyROOT) plans to port it to a version without ROOT, likely involving PyPy. So that might be exactly what you are looking for :-); Cheers, Axel.

Hi Bram, Axel,; let me add to that (and point out that none of the mentioned tools are intrusive, btw.). The biggest problem with boost.python (with pyste; standalone it is a non-starter) and SWIG is that you need to run a separate tool to create and compile bindings. On top, these bindings are compiled against a specific version of Python, making for a distribution headache (just see the non-pickup of Python3 because of this problem). Compare: dictionaries are already available for all the most important classes in experiments, the EDM, because they are generated for I/O needs. They also do not depend on Python, and thus not on any specific version (only PyROOT does). Besides the obvious ease of use, there is also the benefit of lower memory footprints by not replicating structures. (For that matter, PyROOT creates bindings lazily, the others do not.); Other problems we've had, are that boost.python is very, very slow and only in ""keeping alive"" mode since 2004 or so. Pyste is based on gccxml, so no C++11 there, and has seen no major updates since 2005. SWIG is much, much better in both regards, but not up to snuff: it plain and simply can not parse our header files. The way around that, is to write .i files, but as you can imagine, that duplication is not nice for maintenance. Worse, the developers of individual packages need to do this work, and not every C++ developer has Python, let alone SWIG, experience.; Then there's PyPy.
