In this PR I try to fix the situation by allowing three states:; - lock = true => changes in the scene graph are not reflected into the model but the model is flagged as dirty ; - lock = false => changes in the scene graph are imediately reflected into the model; - dirty => true => the model is not anymore synchronized with the sofa scene graph; - dirty => false => the model is showing the content of the scene graph. when going from lock=true to lock=false the model is updated if it was dirty. . To let user to control if they want the graph to be updated we add an icon to lock/unlock the model state. If the model is dirtyfied; a the icon is reflecting the change (with an highly professional icon free of copyright ;)) . Fixes #2920 . The PR also contains few fixes for the modeller (that is still broken anyway). . ______________________________________________________.

And I observed, that the x-coordinates in the `MechanicalObject` are limited in x, to the absolute value of `nx`.; So for ; ```python; num_points = 100; length = 20; ```; the topology is created correctly (at least the points in the instance look valid), but the `MechanicalObject`'s points in x are in [0, 20], even though the number of points is correct. The same is true for the reverse case; ```python; num_points = 20; length = 100; ```; -> `MechanicalObject`'s points in x are in [0, 100]. ---------------------------------------------. ### Environment. **Context**. - System: Ubuntu 20.04; - Version of SOFA: 22.06; - State: Install directory",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/3047

When calling a scene with an `ArticulatedSystemMapping` through `runSofa`, everything works as expected.; When running the same scene through `SofaPython3` with `OpenGL` as rendering, the stack overflows.; Through some commenting out code, I found that saving the `saveLastState` without `restoreLastState` leads to the stack overflow.; Restoring was not done, because the function returned immediately after checking if mappings should be shown. Changes:; - Pulling `restoreLastState` and `saveLastState` into the `if`; - Modernized the loops for readability.

To remove the memory leak, it has to be replaced by:. ```cpp; static const BaseClass* get(); {; static TClass<T, Parents> theClass;; return &theClass;; }; ```. However, `Parents` can be a `std::pair`, which one of the pair type can be an abstract type. Since it is not possible to instantiate an abstract type, the compilation fails.

A nice side-effect is that linear solvers libs will be slightly smaller, as all instanciations of all linear solvers (except btd then) do not contain init_partial_solve() and partial_solve() functions anymore. EDIT: it is even worse, linear solvers not implementing partial_solve does a ""msg_info()"" so w/o printLog off, users wont even know why the ConstraintSolver/ConstraintCorrections is not doing its job....; See unit tests on LCPForceFieldback, it is using SparseLDLSolver (not implementing partial_solve) and the tests do not throw any warning, even if it is using LCPConstraintSolver and LinearSolverConstraintCorrection. ______________________________________________________.

Other methods, such as `Identity`, `transpose` etc, are also concerned for squared matrices. The `static_assert` are therefore no longer useful. . `Identity` has been changed so it is `static constexpr` and it returns a reference. So there is no need to compute the identity matrix each time it is called. `s_identity` is now deprecated. The static variable is now included in the `Identity` method. It is better for static initialization fiasco and required for a `constexpr` context. Also, `s_identity` does not make sense for rectangular matrices. Since it is not possible to conditionally add a class member, it is hidden in the conditionally compiled method `Identity`. In `fixed_array`, the `operator<` is moved out of the class. This allows to compile this operator only when used, and not in explicit instantiations. This is necessary because the operator on `fixed_array<Vec3>` is not implemented (and does not make sense).

The most problematic is that it delegates to the child classes the role of guaranting the correctness (ie: the child musn't forget to call BaseObject::init in MyObject::init). Doing so, at the right location(begin, end fo the init) also force the child to ""know"" what the super::init implementation is doing (to not duplicate) and that the implementation of BaseObject::init() will not change. . This kind of pattern can be replace with the ""delegate pattern"" (not sure this is its official name).
