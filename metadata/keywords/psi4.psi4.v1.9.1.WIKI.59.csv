Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/dftd3.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/dftd3.html

The parameters; fit for individual functionals are now \(s_6\), \(s_8\),; \(a_1\), and \(a_2\). \[E_{disp}^{\text{D3BJ}}=-\sum_{n=6,8} s_n \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}}; \frac{C_n^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^n + (f_{damp})^n}\]. \[f_{damp} = a_1 \sqrt{\frac{C_8^{ij}}{C_6^{ij}}} + a_2\]; All parameters characterizing the dispersion correction are taken from; Grimme’s website; or else from the literature.; With s-dftd3, parameters are also tabulated in the program source. Running DFTD3 or DFTD4¶; A number of a posteriori dispersion corrections are available in; PSI4. While some are computed within PSI4‘s codebase (-D1, -D2,; -CHG, -DAS2009, -DAS2010), the -D3 or -D4 corrections and their variants are; available only through the DFTD3 or DFTD4 programs. Once installed, the; dftd3/PSI4 and dftd4/PSI4 interfaces are transparent, and all corrections are; interfaced exactly alike.; The -D3 interface can use classic or simple-dftd3 programs interchangeably and will prefer the latter.; Despite different defaults in these programs when run independently,; when run through PSI4 as EmpiricalDispersion engine, each should; produce the same result. Moreover, PSI4‘s own defaults and aliases; are unchanged by the new engines, so -D continues to mean -D2,; -D3 continues to mean zero-damping without 3-body correction,; and input files should continue producing the same results.

Elementary Restart¶; The PSI4 intermediate files use the following naming scheme; psi.PID.name.filenumber. where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content.; For those modules providing restart capabilities, the previous file can; be provided through the``restart_file`` option; energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). Only the filenumber is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the; file and copy it to the scratch directory where PSI4 will expect it.; The restart capabilities of a specific method (if any) are found in that method’s documentation.; To provide multiple files, pass them as arguments of a Python list; energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']). Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing PSI4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; psi4 -m. The mechanism for restarting HF/DFT calculations is described in details here. Saving the Wavefunction¶; A core object of PSI4 is the Wavefunction (short wfn) object; energy, wfn = energy('scf',return_wfn=True). This C++/Python object (psi4.core.Wavefunction) contains orbital; data, basis set information, result variables and more.; It can be saved either to a numpy file or converted to a python dictionary; # write the wavefunction to file; wfn.to_file('my_wfn'). # alternatively store the dict representation of the wavefunction in memory; wfn_dict = wfn.to_file(). In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefun",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html

Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html

This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out. Command-line arguments to PSI4 can be accessed through psi4 --help. -a, --append¶; Append results to output file. Default: Truncate first. -h, --help¶; Display the command-line options and usage information. -i <filename>, --input <filename>¶; Input file name.

Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. PBS job file¶; To run a PSI4 job on a PBS queueing system, you need to properly set up; all necessary variables in the PBS job file. Below is a minimal example of; a PBS job file for a threaded job, and a short explanation for each section.; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR; setenv myscratch /scratch/user/psi4.$PBS_JOBID. foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Creating scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; ssh $i mkdir -p $myscratch; end. unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if !

The top section features PBS-specific commands. These depend on the; specific characteristics of your PBS queuing system but they may include:; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node. The total memory requested for; the job by PBS should generally be slightly greater than what indicated; in the input file (see memory setting).; Then, we move to the working directory using PBS variable $PBS_O_WORKDIR and; we create scratch directories on every node, using the $PBS_NODEFILE which; points to a file conta",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html

The next section is very important as it sets the environment variables needed; by PSI4:; unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/external/modules:${PSIPATH}; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/python/modules:${PSIPATH}. PSIDATADIR does not need to be set.; In the present example we unset it to make sure it does not interfere with the internal location-finding.; PSIPATH is needed only if you are using external modules or; plugins in PSI4 and should point to the directories where they can be found. In the; present example, we make sure the variable is set with if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; before adding more paths to it. Finally, PSI_SCRATCH should point to a fast, existing; local disk for temporary file storage. To use 4 threads for OpenMP parallelization; and threaded BLAS (see section Threading), we set -n4 below.; The next step is then to actually run the computation:; /psi/install/directory/bin/psi4 -i input.in -o input.out -n 4. And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html

Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Scratch Files¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file.; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files.

PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) to analyze the optimization.

All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/').

Saving the Wavefunction¶; A core object of PSI4 is the Wavefunction (short wfn) object; energy, wfn = energy('scf',return_wfn=True).

In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefunction from file; wfn_from_file = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file('my_wfn'). # make a wavefunction from the dict; wfn_from_dict = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file(wfn_dict). ~/.psi4rc File¶.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model.

To set up the scratch path from a variable $MYSCRATCH:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). To set up a specific path for the internal coordinate file and instruct PSI4 not to delete it:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(12, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(12, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_INTCO, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_INTCO, True). The Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. As a consequence, the commands in the input files supersede; any instructions in the ~/.psi4rc file. During; execution, the ~/.psi4rc defaults will be loaded in first, but then the commands; in the input file will be executed.; The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html

This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the nu",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/external.html

And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; The scripts discussed below are located in psi4/psi4/share/psi4/fsapt.

Briefly, the interaction between the point charges in A(B); and fragment B(A) enters the SAPT0 interaction energy. It explicitly affects the electrostatics; and induction components, and implicitly affects other SAPT0 components by polarizing the orbitals.; If point charges are present in both subsystems A and B, an additional charge-charge interaction; term is also added to the electrostatic energy. When point charges are assigned to subsystem C, the point; charges in C only polarize the orbitals in both fragment A and B. However, the presence of charges in C does not; directly contribute to the SAPT0 interaction energy.; Examples fsapt-ext-abc and fsapt-ext-abc2; illustrate the use of point charges in F/I-SAPT procedure. Link Orbital Partitioning in I-SAPT¶; The assignment of the A-C and B-C linking electron pairs is controlled by the FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT; keyword. The default setting fisapt_link_assignment c assigns the entire pair to the linker C together with; a +1 nuclear charge from the connecting atoms of A/B to preserve the electrical neutrality of each fragment.; However, as already noticed in [Parrish:2015:051103], such a partitioning might result in unphysical dipole; moments at the interfragment boundaries. Imagine, for example, that I-SAPT is used to examine the interaction; of two methyl groups connected by some linker fragment. When the linking bonds are assigned to C, the carbon atoms; of the methyl groups are missing electrons on one of their sp^3 hybrid orbitals and a dipole moment appears.; These dipole moments have been observed to lead, in some cases, to I-SAPT energy contributions that do not make; physical sense, for example, to a strongly repulsive electrostatic energy between two fragments connected by an; intramolecular hydrogen bond.; To overcome this issue, Luu and Patkowski proposed a reassignment of the linking electron pairs so that each fragment; (C and A/B) gets one electron [Luu:2023:356].

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; The scripts discussed below are located in psi4/psi4/share/psi4/fsapt.

Adding Point Charges to F/I-SAPT Computations¶; Point charges can be added to the interacting subsystems A and B as well; as to the linking fragment C. Briefly, the interaction between the point charges in A(B); and fragment B(A) enters the SAPT0 interaction energy. It explicitly affects the electrostatics; and induction components, and implicitly affects other SAPT0 components by polarizing the orbitals.; If point charges are present in both subsystems A and B, an additional charge-charge interaction; term is also added to the electrostatic energy. When point charges are assigned to subsystem C, the point; charges in C only polarize the orbitals in both fragment A and B. However, the presence of charges in C does not; direct",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/fisapt.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/fisapt.html

This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond. Several schemes for determining this link hybrid were proposed; in [Luu:2023:356] and they all are implemented in PSI4. We recommend the so-called SIAO1 scheme,; fisapt_link_assignment siao1, as it has been observed to provide consistently meaningful I-SAPT terms and a; smooth basis set convergence. The SIAO1 name implies that the projection to construct the link hybrids happens in the; intrinsic atomic orbital space (as opposed to the SAO1 method where the standard atomic orbital space is used), with; one iteration of fragment orbital optimization and link orbital orthogonalization, a process that very quickly; achieves self-consistency. Altogether, the allowed values for FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT are c (default),; ab (the opposite of c where the entire linking pair is assigned to A/B), sao0, sao1, sao2,; siao0, siao1 (recommended for all I-SAPT applications), and siao2 (essentially identical to siao1 but; slightly more expensive).

The keywords for invoking perturbation; theory computations are given below in; Table FNOCC Methods. Full MP4 correlation; energies are also available. Coupled electron pair approximation¶; Coupled-pair methods can be viewed as approximations to CCSD or as; size-extensive modifications of CISD. The methods have the same; complexity as CISD, and solving the CISD or coupled-pair equations; requires fewer floating point operations than solving the CCSD. CISD,; CCSD, and the coupled-pair methods discussed below all scale formally with; the sixth power of system size, and, as with the QCISD method, CEPA; methods retain \({\cal{O}}(o^2v^4)\) complexity of the CCSD equations.; For a detailed discussion of the properties of various coupled-pair; methods, see [Wennmohs:2008:217].; What follows is a very basic description of the practical differences in; the equations that define each of the coupled-pair methods implemented in; PSI4. We begin with the CISD wave function.

(7)¶\[\epsilon_{ij} = \sum_{ab} v_{ij}^{ab} (2 t_{ij}^{ab} - t_{ij}^{ba})\]; Methods whose shifts (\(\Delta_{ij}\) and \(\Delta_i\)) do not; explicitly depend on orbitals \(i\) or \(j\) (CISD, CEPA(0), ACPF,; and AQCC) have solutions that render the energy stationary with respect; variations in the amplitudes. This convenient property allows density; matrices and 1-electron properties to be evaluated without any additional; effort. Note, however, that 1-electron properties are currently; unavailable when coupling these stationary CEPA-like methods with frozen; natural orbitals. Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) [or the resolution of the identity (RI)] and Cholesky; decomposition (CD) techniques are popular in quantum chemistry to avoid; the computation and storage of the 4-index electron repulsion integral; (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the computational scaling of some terms.; DF/CD-CCSD(T) computations are available in PSI4, with or without the; use of FNOs, through the FNOCC module. The implementation and accuracy of; the DF/CD-CCSD(T) method are described in [DePrince:2013:2687].; The DF-CCSD(T) procedure uses two auxiliary basis sets. The first set is; that used in the SCF procedure, defined by the DF_BASIS_SCF; keyword. If this keyword is not specified, an appropriate -JKFIT set is; automatically selected. This auxiliary set defines the ERIs used to; build the Fock matrix used in the DF-CCSD(T) procedure. The second; auxiliary set is used to approximate all other ERIs in the DF-CCSD(T); procedure. The choice of auxiliary basis is controlled by the keyword; DF_BASIS_CC. By default, DF_BASIS_CC is the RI set; (optimized for DFMP2) most appropriate for use with the primary basis.; For example, if the primary basis is aug-cc-pVDZ, the default; DF_BASIS_CC will be aug-cc-pVDZ-RI.; Alternatively, the user can request that the DF-CCSD(T) procedure use a; set of vectors defined by the Cholesky decomposition of the",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/fnocc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/fnocc.html

This convenient property allows density; matrices and 1-electron properties to be evaluated without any additional; effort. Note, however, that 1-electron properties are currently; unavailable when coupling these stationary CEPA-like methods with frozen; natural orbitals. Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) [or the resolution of the identity (RI)] and Cholesky; decomposition (CD) techniques are popular in quantum chemistry to avoid; the computation and storage of the 4-index electron repulsion integral; (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the computational scaling of some terms.; DF/CD-CCSD(T) computations are available in PSI4, with or without the; use of FNOs, through the FNOCC module. The implementation and accuracy of; the DF/CD-CCSD(T) method are described in [DePrince:2013:2687].; The DF-CCSD(T) procedure uses two auxiliary basis sets. The first set is; that used in the SCF procedure, defined by the DF_BASIS_SCF; keyword. If this keyword is not specified, an appropriate -JKFIT set is; automatically selected. This auxiliary set defines the ERIs used to; build the Fock matrix used in the DF-CCSD(T) procedure. The second; auxiliary set is used to approximate all other ERIs in the DF-CCSD(T); procedure. The choice of auxiliary basis is controlled by the keyword; DF_BASIS_CC. By default, DF_BASIS_CC is the RI set; (optimized for DFMP2) most appropriate for use with the primary basis.; For example, ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/fnocc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/fnocc.html

QCISD(T), CCSD(T), MP4, and CEPA¶; The FNOCC module in PSI4 supports several related many-body quantum; chemistry methods, including the CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) methods, several; orders of many-body perturbation theory (MP2-MP4), and a family methods; related to the coupled electron pair approximation (CEPA). Quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster¶; The quadratic configuration interaction singles doubles (QCISD) method of; Pople, Head-Gordon, and Raghavachari [Pople:1987:5968] was originally; presented as a size-consistent extension of configuration interaction; singles doubles (CISD). The method can also be obtained as a; simplified version of the coupled cluster singles doubles (CCSD); method [Purvis:1982]. Consider the set of equations defining CCSD:. (1)¶\[\begin{split}\langle \Psi_0 | (H - E) (1 + T_1 + T_2 + \frac{1}{2}T_1^2)|\Psi_0\rangle = 0, \\; \langle \Psi_i^a | (H - E) (1 + T_1 + T_2 + \frac{1}{2}T_1^2+T_1T_2+\frac{1}{3!}T_1^3)|\Psi_0\rangle = 0, \\; \langle \Psi_{ij}^{ab} | (H - E) (1 + T_1 + T_2 + \frac{1}{2}T_1^2 + T_1T_2+\frac{1}{3!}T_1^3+\frac{1}{2}T_2^2+\frac{1}{2}T_1^2T_2+\frac{1}{4!}T_1^4)|\Psi_0\rangle = 0, \\\end{split}\]; where we have chosen the intermediate normalization,; \(\langle \Psi_0| \Psi \rangle = 1\), and the symbols \(T_1\); and \(T_2\) represent single and double excitation operators. The; QCISD equations can be obtained by omitting all but two terms that; are nonlinear in \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):.

The CISD correlation energy is given by. (4)¶\[E_c = \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} - E_0 | \Psi \rangle,\]; and the amplitudes can be determined by the solution to the coupled set of; equations:. (5)¶\[\begin{split}0 &= \langle \Psi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} - E_0 - E_c | \Psi \rangle, \\; 0 &= \langle \Psi_{i}^{a} | \hat{H} - E_0 - E_c | \Psi \rangle.\end{split}\]; The CISD method is not size-extensive, but this problem can be overcome by; making very simple modifications to the amplitude equations. We replace; the correlation energy, \(E_c\), with generalized shifts for the; doubles and singles equations, \(\Delta_{ij}\) and \(\Delta_i\):.

Specified as an array [ n1, r1, n2, r2, … ] where n1,n2,n3… are atom type strings and r1,r2,r3 are radii in Angstrom. Type: array; Default: No Default. GDMA_SWITCH¶. The value to switch between the older standard DMA and the new grid-based approach. Pairs of primitives whose exponents sum is above this value will be treated using standard DMA. Set to 0 to force all pairs to be treated with standard DMA. Type: double; Default: 4.0. How to configure gdma for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, GDMA is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (multipole analysis).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) gdma; Upstream Dependencies — gdma \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran. CMake Variables. ENABLE_gdma — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with gdma; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For gdma, set to an installation directory containing include/GDMA/GDMA_MANGLE.h; gdma_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built gdma can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/gdma/gdmaConfig.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_gdma — CMake variable to force internal build of gdma instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_gdma — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built gdma and not falling back on internal build. Examples. Build bundled. >>> cmake -DENABLE_gdma=ON. Build without gdma. >>> cmake.

A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

PSI4 features several initial guesses for the; molecular orbitals. The default guess is the superposition of atomic; densities (SAD), discussed in. “Principles for a direct SCF approach to LCAO-MO ab-initio; calculations”, J. Almlöf, K. Faegri, and K. Korsell,; J. Comput. Chem. 3, 385 (1982).; (doi: 10.1002/jcc.540030314).; “Starting SCF calculations by superposition of atomic; densities”, J. H. Van Lenthe, R. Zwaans, H. J. J. Van Dam,; and M. F. Guest, J. Comput. Chem. 27, 926 (2006).; (doi: 10.1002/jcc.20393). PSI4 also features a SAD natural orbital guess, an extended; Hückel guess that employs on-the-fly atomic calculations alike the SAD; guess, as well as a superposition of atomic potentials (SAP) guess; that is based on screening of atomic nuclei. The SAD natural orbitals,; Hückel and SAP guesses have been described in. “An assessment of initial guesses for self-consistent field; calculations. Superposition of Atomic Potentials: simple yet; efficient”, S. Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15,; 1593 (2019) (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01089). Density Cumulant Theory (DCT)¶; PSI4 features several formulations of newly-developed density cumulant; theory (DCT), also known as density cumulant functional theory (DCFT).; The theory and benchmark of this theory are discussed in the following papers:; DC-06 (also known as DCT-06):. “Density Cumulant Functional Theory: First Implementation and; Benchmark Results for the DCFT-06 Model,” A.

Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT)¶; PSI4 features an extremely efficient code to perform wavefunction-based; Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). A good review article for this; method is as follows:. “Perturbation Theory Approach to Intermolecular Potential Energy; Surfaces of van der Waals Complexes,” B. Jeziorski, R. Moszynski,; and K. Szalewicz, Chem. Rev. 94, 1887-1930 (1994).; (doi: 10.1021/cr00031a008). PSI4 benefits enormously from the introduction of density fitting (DF); into SAPT. There are several SAPT truncations available in PSI4. For; guidance on which one to choose, see the SAPT section of the manual; and refer to the following systematic study:. “Levels of Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). I. Efficiency and; Performance for Interaction Energies,’’ T. M. Parker, L. A. Burns, R. M.; Parrish, A. G. Ryno, and C. D. Sherrill, J. Chem. Phys. 140,; 094106 (2014).; (doi: 10.1063/1.4867135).

Burns. PSI4, relies upon the Libxc library for density functionals. Libxc; requires no; additional licence, downloads, or configuration. Conversely, PSI4; cannot build without Libxc. Installation¶; Binary. Libxc is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, Libxc has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; Libxc can be obtained through conda install libxc -c psi4.; Then, hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect Libxc and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove libxc. Source. Note that PSI4 has forked and slightly modified upstream Libxc from; https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc to regain functionality. If using PSI4 built from source and you want Libxc built from; from source also,; let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

How to name keywords in psi4/src/read_options.cc¶; A few guidelines for standardizing option names among modules. TRIPLES (not trip), TRIPLETS (not trip), SINGLES (not sing),; SINGLETS (not sing); CONVERGENCE (not conv, not converge) and TOLERANCE (not tol); Convergence of a method should be governed by an E_CONVERGENCE for; energy and either a D_CONVERGENCE for density or a R_CONVERGENCE; for residual/amplitudes. All of these should be doubles- let the input; parser handle the flexible input format.; Diis should have a boolean DIIS (not do_diis, not use_diis) to turn; on/off diis extrapolation, a DIIS_MIN_VECS and DIIS_MAX_VECS for; minimum and maximum number of diis vectors to use, and a DIIS_START; which is the iteration at which to start saving vectors for diis. Not all; modules conform to all these at present, but they’re as standardized as; they can be without changing code.; AMPS (not amplitude, not amp) for amplitudes; NUM_ (not n) for number (e.g., NUM_AMPS_PRINT, MAX_NUM_VECS,; NUM_THREADS); Some names that could be split into multiple words are staying as one.; Use MAXITER, CACHELEVEL, PUREAM, DERTYPE.; INTS (not integrals), also OEI (not oe_integrals) for; one-electron integrals and TEI (not te_integrals) for two-electron; integrals;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/manage_addon.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/manage_addon.html

Anyone, core-dev or not, is encouraged to review PRs. It’s actually good practice for interacting with other open-source projects, where you don’t have the advantage of knowing or working with the contributors. Before venturing into projects on GitHub where you don’t know the maintainers, it doesn’t hurt to read https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/ .; Psi4 is a learning tool for all involved, so partial reviews in areas of confidence and questions and comments on PRs in general are encouraged.; Approving before CI completes is fine, though it can be mildly personally embarrassing when CI catches something you didn’t.; All main branches (master and 1.N.x maintenance) are protected by GitHub, including administrators, so even with write access, no one can accidentally push (master) or rewrite the history (master and maintenance).; PR owners who also have maintainer status can merge their PRs as GitHub enforces two external reviews.; Unless there’s been a lot of discussion on core-dev about merge order, generally the 2nd positive reviewer merges the PR. Also fine to add review and leave merge for later.; Presently only Azure is set up as a required-to-merge service. Incomplete GHA Ecosystem or Docs won’t block merging, but we do usually let it complete before merging unless it’s a trivial PR.; We don’t enforce branches to be up to date before merging since that’d be a lot of extra CI time and coordination when merging several PRs in a day. So, if a PR hasn’t been updated in a while, and a reviewer is nervous about PR interference, fine to ask submitter to rebase. Or, there’s an update button on the PR – but if this is used, warn the submitted that their remote and local branches will be out of sync.
