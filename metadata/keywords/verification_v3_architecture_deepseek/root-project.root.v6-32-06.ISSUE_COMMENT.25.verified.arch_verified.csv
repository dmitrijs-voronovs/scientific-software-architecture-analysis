These are typical log entries that indicate technical issues during the integration phase. The CMake Error message mentions issues at a specific line number, pointing to a potential problem in the build configuration or dependency resolution. While not explicitly discussing integrability, the failure could be related to integration complexities, such as compatibility or interface issues between components. However, without more context, it's unclear if this is directly tied to integrability or another quality attribute. Therefore, I would label this as a true positive because it relates to a build issue that could impact system integration.","
