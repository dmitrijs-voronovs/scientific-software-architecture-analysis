Energy Efficiency,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.

Integrability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.

Content: Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you. Thanks!

",True,"The provided content discusses issues related to Fastp and adapter removal based on sequence context. It involves troubleshooting specific sequencing adapters and their detection in different read files (R1 and R2). The context pertains to how software components (Fastp) handle certain adapter sequences, which relates to the integrability of the system by ensuring that components can be combined or integrated effectively. The problem revolves around technical compatibility between Fastp's adapter recognition and the actual adapter sequences in different reads, potentially causing integration issues if not handled properly. Therefore, this content is relevant to the integrability quality attribute as it deals with software component interactions and their compatibility.","

Modifiability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given.

Usability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.

Content: Just to jump in. The issue with the unmated reads being included in the clean fastq is one I just bumped into and I definitely agree with you. So i'm thinking that the unmated reads should go in a separate junk file, essentially **R1 no pass.fastq** and **R2 no pass.fastq**. That can include the reads that don't pass other filters as well i think. Should resolve a lot of pain (at least for me). Also, very nice tool, especially because its clean and simple to use, which is key.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing quality attributes in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to distinguish sentences that clearly relate to a given quality attribute from those that do not. 

Evaluate whether the content accurately aligns with its associated quality attribute, given the context provided. Your goal is to determine if the content makes sense in relation to the quality attribute description or if it is a false positive.

Data:

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: You can simply achieve this by scripts. No plan to support yet.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content suggests using scripts to achieve usability without any plan for support, which aligns with the idea that users can effectively use the system through efficient means.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: You can simply achieve this by scripts. No plan to support yet.
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses implementation details and scripts without mentioning any architectural concepts, patterns, or structural considerations."

",True,"The content discusses performance issues when using a cluster with client servers and describes how I/O issues are being mitigated by a striped raid server. It also mentions that trimming PE fastq files takes longer than Trimmomatic due to reading time and thread limitations, which relates to the efficiency aspect of usability. The tool's performance is hindered by the way it reads and processes data, indicating problems with effectiveness in task completion.","
