You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content:  subtract:; ```bash; bedtools subtract \; -a HG003_043024.indels_only.bcftools_filter.vcf.gz \; -b HG003_indels_043024.vcf.gz | wc -l. 180869; ```. So roughly it matches. Now look at some variants:; ```bash; bedtools subtract \; -a HG003_043024.indels_only.bcftools_filter.vcf.gz \; -b HG003_indels_043024.vcf.gz | head. chr1	10247	.	TAAACCCTA	T	0.5	RefCall	.

So there are few variants that we are not picking up. Next, I picked the region where variant ""chr1 10247"" is and ran make_examples with a debug command:. Without filter command:; ```bash; chr1 10240 T ['TA']; chr1 10246 TA ['T']; chr1 10249 A ['C']; chr1 10253 TA ['T']; chr1 10256 A ['C']; ```; I see these five variants. With filtering I see:; ```bash; FILTERING CANDIDATES; chr1 10240 T ['TA']; chr1 10246 TA ['T']; chr1 10253 TA ['T']; ```. I am unsure how to reproduce this. Are you using a publicly available bam file? I can also run DV with and without this command and generate results to investigate further. It would be faster and helpful if you can point me to the bam you are using so it's more specific to your issue.

Availability," the reference and non-reference read counts instead generated the reference call because a candidate was not made at that position.; > ; > Second, I would recommend that you look at the visual report that @MariaNattestad created in the most recent DeepVariant release. There is a way to run this on previous VCF files, see: [This page](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/deepvariant-vcf-stats-report.md); > ; > In that visualization, take a look at the VAF support for each call. The nearby variant phenomenon manifests as a higher number of REF calls with a VAF close to 1.0. In humans, this seems to be DeepVariant avoiding false calls in LINE elements and segmental duplications, but this could be undesirable depending on your reference genome and population structure. Hello, in my case, which is not humans, I find the following. First, the reads I used are the same used during the reference genome assembly process. Therefore, any new homozygous variant with a vaf of ~ 1 is either the reflect of assembly errors or mapping errors. I do find such variants. But I am more intrigued by the peak of Hom (x/x) at a vaf of ~ 0.5 . am I right to assume this is not typical and might reflect a problem? ; Interestingly for the reference calls, there also seems to be 2 peaks, one with a vaf around 0.2 which I guess is all right and one with a vaf around 0.5 which I guess also indicates a potential problem. ![genotypes_deepvariant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23341393/72908229-7db81b00-3d35-11ea-99f9-e3dfa126a127.png).

However, in your case, it seems like there's nothing useful in the log. I think I've heard about similar cases before (where there was no useful error message showing up). I previously wondered if it's possible that `parallel` somehow hid away some message. But I can't immediately think of a reproducible setting that I can debug. But speaking of ""returned non-zero exit status 252"", I did a quick search in our GitHub issues and found: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/325; Can you see if this might be relevant to your issue?. If so, I'd still like to find a way to reproduce on my side, so I can see if we can make a more meaningful error message... 🤔

Availability,"/github.com/cschin/DeepDiveDeepVariant), you'll see him using `--norealign_reads` which skips the preprocessing step described in the paper. That's why he's getting the `T` which a is a possible sequencing error. 2) The general realignment heuristic is the following: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/deepvariant/realigner/realigner.py#L439-L454. 3) The ploidy dictates the most likely haplotypes which is 2 :). 3) The haploytype realignment also been optimized a bit since that paper. Take a look at this section of the code: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/deepvariant/realigner/fast_pass_aligner.cc#L117-L166. 4) Yes, the realignment is basically used to update the reads' interpretation via the best-representative haplotype, trying to approach what might be closest-truth if the sequencer were relatively perfect.

In general I'd recommend not doing this anyway, since this will eventually slow down any downstream processing of the gVCFs such as merging gVCFs using GLnexus, etc. I think the easiest way to achieve this would be by post-processing the gVCFs generated with `--gvcf_gq_binsize=1`.

If my data are stored in 200 partitions, it mean that my program will launch 200 tasks by using pipe() to call taskset. I can't make sure which partition will be assigned to which computing node. Round-Robin assignment is a way, but it's violated the policy of the resource management (like Spark standalone or YARN). For example, I have 8 computing node with 4 cores per each. My Spark process might allocate 24 cores. It might be 8 computing nodes with 3 cores per each or 6 computing nodes with 4 cores per each. Furthermore, there is no information to let me know which task is done or which cpu core is available in my Spark program. the resource allocation might be unbalance and performance might be impacted severely, especially when several iterations of task assignment.

The only other thing I can think of is that given that your number of reads is large, DeepVariant would downsample them before going into the model. So your supporting reads are picked by an allele counter, and it uses them to generate a matrix (image) that gets fed into the model generating the GT and GQ values. The height of these matrices is usually 100 rows. If it is greater it will randomly downsample from these reads, and usually use 95 of them as 5 are used for representing the reference sequence. I'm assuming you've updated the model as denoted in the tutorial and not used the regular WGS one. I know it's obvious, but as noted in the paper there is a difference between a RNA-seq model versus the WGS/WES one provided by DeepVariant. Other than that is there anything special around this site in IGV? Do you see this as a singular variant without anything surrounding it?

You can get exon information from the [GTF-formatted GENCODE files](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/), which will label exon regions like this (including their start and end sites):. ```; chr1 HAVANA exon 12613 12721 . + . gene_id ""ENSG00000290825.1""; transcript_id ""ENST00000456328.2""; gene_type ""lncRNA""; gene_name ""DDX11L2""; transcript_type ""lncRNA""; transcript_name ""DDX11L2-202""; exon_number 2; exon_id ""ENSE00003582793.1""; level 2; transcript_support_level ""1""; tag ""basic""; tag ""Ensembl_canonical""; havana_transcript ""OTTHUMT00000362751.1"";; ```. With this you can determine where in the exon your variant falls in, and if it is near the end or beginning. I will focus on the high quality one variant, as the low quality one can be problematic. Skin tissue should be fine based on this figure: . ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/fc7823e6-de5f-46ea-80b9-59c5913d79de). The only other thing I can think of is that given that your number of reads is large, DeepVariant would downsample them before going into the model. So your supporting reads are picked by an allele counter, and it uses them to generate a matrix (image) that gets fed into the model generating the GT and GQ values. The height of these matrices is usually 100 rows. If it is greater it will randomly downsample from these reads, and usually use 95 of them as 5 are used for representing the reference sequence. I'm assuming you've updated the model as denoted in the tutorial and not used the regular WGS one. I know it's obvious, but as noted in the paper there is a difference between a RNA-seq model versus the WGS/WES one provided by DeepVariant. Other than that is there anything special around this site in IGV? Do you see this as a singular variant without anything surrounding it? Is there anything special of the sequences surrounding the variant (i.e. repeats/etc.)? Does it align uniquely or are there other alignments it can occur at? Do you see anything problema

Content: Andrea;; Thanks for following up and for all the additional details. It's a bit strange, as all the file paths in your error messages look like it got installed under python 3.6 rather than 2.7. It's hard to tell if that's just coming from the conda machinery or indicative of a different problem. . You could try installing in a separate environment as a first pass to avoid any conflicts:; ```; conda create -y -n deepvariant python=2.7 -c bioconda -c conda-forge deepvariant 'google-cloud-sdk<243.0.0'; ```; If that still has the same issue, then we'd need to dig more into the `post-link.sh` errors you're seeing. In this step deepvariant is downloading the trained model files from GCP, which can sometimes have internet issues or other problems. This previous post has some suggestions for debugging it:. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/177#issuecomment-504940567. Hope this helps get it resolved and get deepvariant running for you.

",True,"The provided content discusses issues related to software functionality and data analysis, specifically in the context of variant calling with DeepVariant. The user mentions problems with annotation and effect prediction due to multiple small variants being called separately instead of as a MNP (multi-nucleotide polymorphism). This relates to system reliability and fault tolerance since incorrect variant calls can lead to downstream errors. Therefore, it ties into the Availability quality attribute by ensuring the system's ability to handle and recover from such issues, thus aligning with the description.","

Availability,"Hi @ASLeonard . This is an interesting question. The ability to sort reads and label them with a phasing tag (specifically HP) is general to DeepVariant (meaning that on the code level it is straightforward to add to DeepVariant). This feature is only used for long reads. We performed experiments in non-trio phasing of short reads, but found there is not enough information for local phasing to add information. . Trio phasing can be much more informative for short reads over long ranges. The main obstacle is that we do not have pre-trained models which have learned how to use this information as we have for long reads. It would, in theory, be possible to train models for this (though it would be a reasonable amount of work). One of the obstacles for us to do this is that we don't know what to recommend as the best practices for the trio binning process. . I don't think that variant calling on an assembly is necessarily a good idea, because the assembly itself will have errors, and the expected distribution of REF, HET, and HOM calls will be quite different from the typical variant calling problem. Assemblies are usually less complete than the reference, especially with short read data, and this is likely to create a lot of mapping artifacts. . I don't have any good recommendations for how to incorporate trio haplotype information at this time, but if you have reasonable suggestions on how to do so, we are happy to consider using them within DeepTrio.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: Hi @ASLeonard . This is an interesting question. The ability to sort reads and label them with a phasing tag (specifically HP) is general to DeepVariant (meaning that on the code level it is straightforward to add to DeepVariant). This feature is only used for long reads. We performed experiments in non-trio phasing of short reads, but found there is not enough information for local phasing to add information. . Trio phasing can be much more informative for short reads over long ranges. The main obstacle is that we do not have pre-trained models which have learned how to use this information as we have for long reads. It would, in theory, be possible to train models for this (though it would be a reasonable amount of work). One of the obstacles for us to do this is that we don't know what to recommend as the best practices for the trio binning process. . I don't think that variant calling on an assembly is necessarily a good idea, because the assembly itself will have errors, and the expected distribution of REF, HET, and HOM calls will be quite different from the typical variant calling problem. Assemblies are usually less complete than the reference, especially with short read data, and this is likely to create a lot of mapping artifacts. . I don't have any good recommendations for how to incorporate trio haplotype information at this time, but if you have reasonable suggestions on how to do so, we are happy to consider using them within DeepTrio. Thanks,; Andrew

Content: Hi @Asppagh ; From the error above it wasn't very informative. This seems like it failed on the make_examples step already. We should have just stopped there, instead of proceeding into call_variants and next steps. --> This is now fixed in internal code, and will be fixed in the next release. Another question is -- why did the failed make_examples not produce any useful logs?. This one is a bit less clear to me. . With the same setting, instead of using /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant (which is a convenient script that combines 3 steps), can you try directly running with . `/opt/deepvariant/bin/make_examples --mode calling --ref ""/ref/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa"" --reads ""/input/S-001737188.markdup.bam"" --examples ""/output/intermediate_results_dir/make_examples.tfrecord.gz"" --runtime_by_region ""/output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region/make_examples_runtime.tsv"" --gvcf ""/output/intermediate_results_dir/gvcf.tfrecord.gz""`. This should allow you to just run 1 make_examples, without using GNU parallel as well. Hopefully whatever error messages will be more clear here.; Thanks!

Content: Hi @Axze-rgb,. Yes, you want to only look at your `./.` and `0/0` genotypes, because the subclonal variants will likely not look like true germline ones, and probably fall into the category of not being called or a reference call. Keep in mind the model was created with a specific type of variation in the dataset as it was minimizing the loss function to optimizes the model's weights, in order to have the variant caller's GQ values correlate maximally with the GQ scores derived empirically from GIAB ground truth. So your tensor images might not look like optimal ones that the model would recognize as a true germline variant, but that discrepancy might have significant statistical stability above the noise region, of which you can take advantage of. That is what your are trying to test for and eventually model, with the hope to show that the PacBio model can be generalized for more dataset types $`-`$ that's the basic hypothesis here. So here's a quick way you can fix the multiallelic issue above:. $`1)`$ First split the multiallelic sites into biallelic records like this:. ```; bcftools norm -m - multi_allelic.vcf > biallelic.vcf; ```. $`2)`$ Then parse for the `0/0` and `./.` genotypes $`-`$ I'm assuming your genotypes are not phased:. ```; bcftools query -f '[%GT,%GQ,%VAF]' biallelic.vcf | grep '\./\.\|0/0' | cut -f2,3 -d',' > gq_vaf.csv; ```. Then just load it up in R with `read.csv(""gq_vaf.csv"")`, and plot it. There is a lot more error modeling you will need to do to generate the confidence intervals, which would probably require more data. Hope it helps,; ~p

At the time we were putting together the vg-giraffe paper, we noticed that Indel errors would occur because the positioning of read indel events in the CIGAR string were not always left-normalized. ABRA both fixed that issue and also seems to give some additional advantage by standardizing the representation before running the candidate generation in DeepVariant. Subsequent to that finding, both ourselves and the vg team built methods which left-normalize Indel CIGAR events during processing. We found that this reduced almost all, but not quite all, of the Indel performance difference with ABRA processed reads. Because we have built the DeepVariant vg pipeline to include read normalization with the --normalize_reads=true tag, we don't routinely benchmark the two methods against each other. Our last head-to-head benchmark on ABRA on and off on 35x HG003 was no_ABRA Indel F1=0.9953, with ABRA Indel F1=0.9958. @pichuan Has made [this linked gist](https://gist.github.com/pichuan/eedab4cf2e06fa7ceb2fad0f9b3f8066) that we use for efficient, single machine processing of vg giraffe+DeepVariant. We opted not to include the use of ABRA realignment in that pipeline. With the benchmark numbers available here, I hope this is sufficient information for you to decide whether you would like to include it or not. We continue to look at improvements in the Indel realignment/reassembly process to see if we can further improve in some of the manners that ABRA helps.

We are currently working on a deeper description of the phasing logic used in DeepVariant, which may help understand or reproduce the haplotag method more easily. Please let me know if anything in the explanation is unclear or can be elaborated further.

Content: Hi @Taghrid-M,. This is good! One small thing, I think the average read length is 48,060 based on [this publication](; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9205427/pdf/main.pdf). The thing is that Guppy 3.6.0 is a bit old, and will have a higher error rate when processing the FAST5 signals from the R9 nanopore through the bidirectional RNN to generate the FASTQ file, [as shown in the following post](https://github.com/kishwarshafin/pepper/issues/90). . So that the proper SNP Pepper model gets selected internally, you can use the `--ont_r9_guppy4_hac` argument with `run_pepper_margin_deepvariant call_variants`, though not sure [version r0.8](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kishwars/pepper_deepvariant/r0.8/images/sha256-70908591ad67e8567a6e4551119b2cfc33d957ad39701c8af51b36b516214645?context=explore) has the Guppy 4 model. Otherwise you can use [version r0.4 of the Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kishwars/pepper_deepvariant/r0.4/images/sha256-0a609f60aa45620b1949c0ffa06299554248d77e23f4186aaa1c3306a95f20a2?context=explore). . Ideally maybe you can get the FAST5 files from the [following Amazon S3 page](https://registry.opendata.aws/ont-open-data/) and reprocess them with Guppy 5 $`-`$ as that's the latest version that the Pepper model seems to be trained against $`-`$ so that you can then utilize the `--ont_r9_guppy5_sup` parameter with the [r0.8 container](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kishwars/pepper_deepvariant/r0.8/images/sha256-70908591ad67e8567a6e4551119b2cfc33d957ad39701c8af51b36b516214645?context=explore), or [version r0.5 of the Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kishwars/pepper_deepvariant/r0.5/images/sha256-13906107b84849590400074e84ce12aba051447a8118c84f31f2b20540fbd807?context=explore). Regarding troubleshooting maybe you can run it with `--dry` so you can get the individual commands, so you can run each one individually to determine where the bottleneck is stemming from. I'll wait for @kishwarshafin to confirm what would

I haven't got time to do so; but in the next few weeks (to a month) I'll likely need to re-run the training tutorial anyway. I'll try to find a time to see if it could be easy to tweak that behavior (but I don't know for sure). I'll keep this issue open and assigned to me for now.

Availability,"Hi @aderzelle . Today we released DeepVariant v0.9, which contains several changes to code and training models.

To briefly summarize what we believe to be the cause - in candidate generation, a de Bruijn graph of variant and reference haplotypes is constructed. In rare cases, some graph paths are created in which local connections are valid, but no individual read supports the entire path. In your case, this caused two similar representations to generate candidates at different positions, each of which could be locally supported. In our fix, we require at least some support for the constructed graph of the candidate haplotype. We also noticed a separate fix that resolves your case. Specifically, your case was sensitive to the kmer length used to construct the graph. By default, this is 10, but we noticed that increasing to 15 also resolved your issue. We think this may reflect local repetitiveness. We have exposed this parameter in make_examples as: --dbg_min_k. This is available when running make_examples directly, but not in the Docker image.

If you'd like to merge DeepVariant gVCFs without any filtering or genotype revision, you can download the `.yml` file here https://gist.github.com/tedyun/1d4f57ca67fb18647b7b251f9e0b35c2 and use `--config DeepVariant_nomod.yml` instead when running GLnexus. I hope this helps and please let us know if you have any more questions/comments. [1] https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.942086. Best,; Ted

The work detailed in the blog and in the publication (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/01/23/519025.full.pdf) represent our initial efforts to train a model on PacBio data. Subsequent to that publication, PacBio generated more extensive training Sequel II data. We used this data to build more robust training datasets across a diverse range of coverage, insert sizes, and machine runs. This is the model which has been released in version 0.8.

Content: Hi @anitagh and @PlatonB , ; to give you an update on this issue, we have made a change internally that:; 1) Added `--sample_name` to run_deepvariant.py; 2) When input BAM files has no sample names or more than one sample names, instead of crashing with the error message you reported, we now use a default string as the sample name (or pick one from the multiple names) and prints out a warning. This behavior should be less cumbersome to our users, and shouldn't cause any issues for most use cases. Our team is working towards a next release. Once the release is out, I can post another update to this issue to let you know. For now, please bear with us and use the solution in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/222#issuecomment-534768468. We'll keep you posted!

Availability,"Hi @avilella,. That's a great question. We did some limited experiments with DeepVariant on lower coverage samples, but not at the 2.5x-5x range directly (see attached image using an earlier version of DeepVariant than available on GitHub). . Typically at such a low depth you need to follow a joint calling strategy like the 1000 Genomes project in order to get accurate allele discovery across many samples. If you are trying to do single sample calling from low coverage, despite the relatively low quality of calls you'll get due to the low coverage, you can certainly use DeepVariant. You really don't need to do anything different than for a deep WGS sample, so just follow the case study example command lines. . There are some options in make_examples.py to manipulate the thresholds for generating candidate variant calls, but I'm not sure tweaking those will materially change the results.

This is because this logic in our code writes a temp file:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/deepvariant/keras_modeling.py#L97-L99. ```; tmp_weights_dir = tempfile.gettempdir(); tmp_weights_path = os.path.join(tmp_weights_dir, 'tmp_weights.h5'); model.save_weights(tmp_weights_path); ```. Can you check your setting, and see if somehow your run wasn't able to create a temp file?. I reran our set up in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/docs/deepvariant-complete-t7-case-study.md (using a GCP machine as an example) and wasn't able to reproduce that error. So, it'll be very helpful for me to understand your machine setup, and try to make our code more robust in the future. Thank you!

My suspicion is that the reference length is mismatched, but it might be possible that the reference sequence ends in real genomic DNA that reads are mapping to (and then extending beyond the reference length) and this causes DeepVariant to fail (I haven't seen this before, but it could be a plausible behavior). I think the safest thing is to remap the reads to what you know for sure is the same reference you will call on, and let me know if this issue remains. Thanks,; Andrew

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content discusses issues related to chromosome names in BAM files and reference genome length mismatches which affect the functionality (availability) of the system when running DeepVariant. The problems described could hinder the proper processing and analysis, potentially leading to failures. Therefore, this is a true positive as it relates to ensuring the system's readiness and handling errors to maintain availability.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: Hi @moldach . Thank you for the header data. The chromosome names in the BAM (I, I, III, IV, V, X, MtDNA) differ from those in your original reference file (chrI_pilon, chrII_pilon), etc... This is what is causing the first error, DeepVariant requires chromosome names to match in order to run. The second error is a bit harder to diagnose, but I would guess this is because the sequence of your reference genome does not extend as far as some of the mapping positions in the BAM file. My suspicion is that the reference length is mismatched, but it might be possible that the reference sequence ends in real genomic DNA that reads are mapping to (and then extending beyond the reference length) and this causes DeepVariant to fail (I haven't seen this before, but it could be a plausible behavior). I think the safest thing is to remap the reads to what you know for sure is the same reference you will call on, and let me know if this issue remains. Thanks,; Andrew
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses issues with chromosome names and reference genome lengths affecting data processing in a bioinformatics tool (DeepVariant). While this could relate to data integration or pipeline design in software architecture, it focuses on specific technical errors and computational problems rather than the high-level architectural concepts."
