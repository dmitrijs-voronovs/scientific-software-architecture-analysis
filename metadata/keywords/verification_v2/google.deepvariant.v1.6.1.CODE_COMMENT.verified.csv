Content: """"""Gets the list of model variables that should be restored. The primary use of this function is to get a subset of tf.Variables from a; slim-defined model that we'd like to restore from a checkpoint.

This function allows a clean API to get; just the *model* variables from a graph, excluding all of those non-model; variables, along with optionally removing parts of the model graph via; exclude scopes.

If the; # results are concordant (i.e., the genotype predicted by the marginal; # likelihood for each variant is the same as the genotype predicted when; # maximizing the joint likelihood across all variants), we return variants; # with those calls and the rescaled likelihoods. Otherwise, we log a warning; # and emit the original (incompatible) variants.; #; # For example, a biallelic deletion with probabilities of homref, het, homalt; # = 0.01, 0.9, 0.09 and inside it a biallelic SNP with probs 0.02, 0.48, 0.5.; # Naively this would be called as a heterozygous indel and a homozygous SNP,; # which is impossible as there are three total alternate genotypes. The; # algorithm does the following:; #; # Indel SNP Joint prob; # 0/0 0/0 0.01 * 0.02 = 0.0002; # 0/0 0/1 0.01 * 0.48 = 0.0048; # 0/0 1/1 0.01 * 0.50 = 0.0050; # 0/1 0/0 0.90 * 0.02 = 0.0180; # 0/1 0/1 0.90 * 0.48 = 0.4320*; # 0/1 1/1 <invalid> = 0; # 1/1 0/0 0.09 * 0.02 = 0.0018; # 1/1 0/1 <invalid> = 0; # 1/1 1/1 <invalid> = 0; #; # So using the highest joint likelihood, we predict het indel and het SNP.; #; # The marginal probability of each genotype for the indel is:; # 0/0: 0.0002 + 0.0048 + 0.0050 = 0.01; # 0/1: 0.0180 + 0.4320 = 0.45; # 1/1: 0.0018 = 0.0018; #; # which after normalizing to sum to 1 is roughly 0.022, 0.974, 0.004.; # The marginal probability for the SNP, after performing similar; # calculations, is 0.043, 0.946, 0.011. So the marginals also predict a het; # indel and a het SNP. Since the two calculations agree, we use this; # genotype call and modifie

Content: """"""Gets the diploid genotype for candidate_variant from matched truth_variant. This method figures out the genotype for candidate_variant by matching alleles; in candidate_variant with those used by the genotype assigned to; truth_variant. For example, if candidate is A/C and truth is A/C with a 0/1; genotype, then this function would return (0, 1) indicating that there's one; copy of the A allele and one of C in truth. If the true genotype is 1/1, then; this routine would return (1, 1). The routine allows candidate_variant and truth_variant to differ in both; the number of alternate alleles, and even in the representation of the same; alleles due to those differences. For example, candidate could be:. AGT/A/AGTGT => 2 bp deletion and 2 bp insertion. and truth could have:. A/AGT => just the simplified 2 bp insertion. And this routine will correctly equate the AGT/AGTGT allele in candidate; with the A/AGT in truth and use the number of copies of AGT in truth to; compute the number of copies of AGTGT when determining the returned genotype.

Safety,"ulting array is sum(10^result) ~= 1.0. The ~=; indicates that the result is not necessarily == 1.0 but very close. This function is a fast and robust approximation of the true normalization of; a log10 transformed probability vector. To understand the approximation,; let's start with the exact calculation. Suppose I have three models, each; emitting a probability that some data was generated by that model:. data = {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} => probabilities from models A, B, and C. These probabilities are unnormalized, in the sense that the total probability; over the vector doesn't sum to 1 (sum(data) = 0.111). In many applications we; want to normalize this vector so that sum(normalized(data)) = 1 and the; relative magnitudes of the original probabilities are preserved (i.e,:. data[i] / data[j] = normalized(data)[i] / normalized(data)[j]. for all pairs of values indexed by i and j. For much of the work we do in; genomics, we have so much data that representing these raw probability; vectors in real-space risks numeric underflow/overflow, so we instead; represent our probability vectors in log10 space:. log10_data = log10(data) = {-1, -2, -3}. Given that we expect numeric problems in real-space, normalizing this log10; vector is hard, because the standard way you'd do the normalization is via:. data[i] = data[i] / sum(data); log10_data[i] = log10_data[i] - log10(sum(10^data)). But computing the sum of log10 values this way is dangerous because the naive; implementation converts back to real-space to do the sum, the very operation; we're trying to avoid due to numeric instability. This function implements an approximate normalization, which relaxes the need; for an exact calculation of the sum. This function ensures that the; normalization is numerically safe at the expense of the sum not being exactly; equal to 1 but rather just close. Args:; log10_probs: array-like of floats.

Quality Attribute: Safety
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: ulting array is sum(10^result) ~= 1.0. The ~=; indicates that the result is not necessarily == 1.0 but very close. This function is a fast and robust approximation of the true normalization of; a log10 transformed probability vector. To understand the approximation,; let's start with the exact calculation. Suppose I have three models, each; emitting a probability that some data was generated by that model:. data = {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} => probabilities from models A, B, and C. These probabilities are unnormalized, in the sense that the total probability; over the vector doesn't sum to 1 (sum(data) = 0.111). In many applications we; want to normalize this vector so that sum(normalized(data)) = 1 and the; relative magnitudes of the original probabilities are preserved (i.e,:. data[i] / data[j] = normalized(data)[i] / normalized(data)[j]. for all pairs of values indexed by i and j. For much of the work we do in; genomics, we have so much data that representing these raw probability; vectors in real-space risks numeric underflow/overflow, so we instead; represent our probability vectors in log10 space:. log10_data = log10(data) = {-1, -2, -3}. Given that we expect numeric problems in real-space, normalizing this log10; vector is hard, because the standard way you'd do the normalization is via:. data[i] = data[i] / sum(data); log10_data[i] = log10_data[i] - log10(sum(10^data)). But computing the sum of log10 values this way is dangerous because the naive; implementation converts back to real-space to do the sum, the very operation; we're trying to avoid due to numeric instability. This function implements an approximate normalization, which relaxes the need; for an exact calculation of the sum. This function ensures that the; normalization is numerically safe at the expense of the sum not being exactly; equal to 1 but rather just close. Args:; log10_probs: array-like of floats. An array of log10 probabilties. Returns:; np.array with the same shape as log10_probs but where su
