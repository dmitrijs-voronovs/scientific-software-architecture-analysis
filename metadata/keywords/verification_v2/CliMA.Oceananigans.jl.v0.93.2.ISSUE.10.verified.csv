Content: I changed a setting. I don't know how to test it though other than registering a new version... But what if it doesn't work?

Testability,"I changed the name because I believe that ""golden master"" is misleading: as far as I know, a ""golden master"" test is one in which the output of the model matches some *externally* verified result (eg, an MITgcm solution, or a numerical solution reported in the literature). In other words, a ""golden master"" in our case is another numerical model that we (arbitrarily) deem to be a master. These tests are not ""golden master"" tests in that sense. Instead, they test whether the output of the model has ""regressed"", or changed relative to a prior output of the model generated in an identical configuration. Basically, we should not commit ""updates"" to golden master output, because the golden master is... the golden master. However, we do have to update the regression test data when we find bugs in `Oceananigans`. Make sense?. It would be nice to have golden master tests, too. Our best hope for this are tests that use a turbulence closure, since there are many published results for ""low-resolution"" solutions using common turbulence closures like Constant Smagorinsky.

Quality Attribute: Testability

Content: I decided to program the different advection schemes in Julia, without using Oceananigans. I can share the code if anyone is interested but it's nothing fancy, and needs some cleaning up. I found that the 5th order upwinding stencil, as used in Oceananigans, should have fifth order convergence. See the results below. So the good news is the stencil formula is correct.

Testability,"I did a few tests with some criteria for timestep-skipping with a couple of my own simulations in addition to the MWE included here. In summary:. 1. Criterion `sim.Δt / 1e10`: successfully gets rids of the problem in both the MWE and in my simulations; 2. Criterion `10 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: doesn't get rid of the problem in any simulation; 3. `100 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: fixes the problem in the MWE but not in my simulations, although it does decrease its frequency of occurrence a good amount.; 4. `1000 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: fixes everything in all simulations I've tried. So only options 1 and 4 fully fix the problem (at least in the simulations I've tried so far). For me both those options rely on pretty arbitrary numbers though, so I'm not very happy with neither. From the point of view seeing the timestep-skipping as an approximation ($u^{n+1} \approx u^n$), then maybe criterion 1 makes more sense, although I'm not sure how it'd behave for Float32 simulations. I see three possible ways to go about it right now:. 1. Do what this PR is doing, and manually set the criterion to either option 1 or 4 above. If it turns out that some simulations still have issues, we revisit.; 2. We add `min_Δt` as a property of `NonhydrostaticModel` (or maybe `Simulation`?). I think the minimum `Δt` for which time skipping will be necessary will vary significantly between simulations, so this solution deals with that by leaving the decision up to the user if they are interested in the pressure output.; 3.

Testability,I don't think I've ever tried running Julia on a workstation GPU like the Quadro P400. We usually run with a Volta V100 or a Titan V which both share the same Volta microarchitecture so maybe this is why we haven't seen big differences between the two. But I think the P400 uses the Pascal microarchitecture. So this might support the claim that the tests are failing due to accumulation of tiny arithmetic differences between GPUs (since GPUs between microarchitectures might produce slightly different answers).,test,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1179#issuecomment-726971926:350,tests,350,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1179#issuecomment-726971926,1,['test'],['tests'],"The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: I don't think I've ever tried running Julia on a workstation GPU like the Quadro P400. We usually run with a Volta V100 or a Titan V which both share the same Volta microarchitecture so maybe this is why we haven't seen big differences between the two. But I think the P400 uses the Pascal microarchitecture. So this might support the claim that the tests are failing due to accumulation of tiny arithmetic differences between GPUs (since GPUs between microarchitectures might produce slightly different answers).

I'm not sure I really understand why it would make a difference. I'm wondering @simone-silvestri are you sure that your test was using this code?. Either way I see no reason not to merge this. Perhaps we will continue to find improvements for PartialCellBottom but I think this is ready to be used in an example. Note that in the internal tide case the partial cells have the interesting effect of weakening the vertical velocity. That could make sense if the topography is somehow ""less effectively steep"" than in the full cell case.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: I made a simple script for testing, and it takes 3 minutes to run on my PC \(on either CPU or GPU\). This is a 2D simulation initialized with a lateral buoyancy gradient. The top is tilted.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: I think that's a fine strategy. We can add a kwarg to `NonhydrostaticModel` called `hydrostatic_pressure_anomaly`. We can set it to `CenterField(grid)` to preserve existing behavior, or set it to `nothing` to avoid the separation. And we should probably make `nothing` default so that triply periodic problems can be done out of the box. Then we don't have to re-do the regression tests either because we preserve existing behavior... I think that's also a less invasive change than this PR because we don't have to change `pressures` to `pressure` everywhere, hmm. Since you've done most of the legwork I think you have prerogative to open a new PR if you like (and I can help once you do).

Testability,"I think this PR is ready to be merged. It might be too big to ask others to review but @jm-c and @christophernhill have a pretty good idea of what changes were made to accommodate channels. Some notes:. A new Poisson solver has been added that solves Poisson's equation with periodic boundary conditions in the x and staggered Neumann BCs in the y and z. This involves computing a 2D DCT on the GPU, which has no native DCT, so I implemented the fast 2D cosine transform from Makhoul (1980). Unfortunately the 2D FCT does not generalize from the 1D version, and extra steps are involved. In particular, as Fourier coefficients need to be indexed in multiple ways in some statements, we need a second buffer/storage array until I can figure out whether this is necessary. A couple of 1D masks are also needed. Anyways, so this PNN Poisson solver is a little involved, but is still decently fast. We have more tests and more GPU tests in general, but this also means that the test suite takes even longer to run especially with GPUs. I've moved each test set to it's respective file so we can use the regression tests as a stand-alone . In particular, this PR heavily refactors `poisson_solvers.jl`. It's more modular, concrete, and better documented I still need to describe the algorithms in the docs, especially important as it's not easy to figure this out and the only references are sparse papers (no code or implementations as far as I can tell). `time_steppers.jl` has also been cleaned up.

1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""
}
",True,The provided content does not relate to the quality attribute 'Testability'. It concerns issue tracking and logging macro definition.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: I'd like to also two 2D examples. 1. rising thermal bubble and; 2. lid-driven cavity. as super simple examples. Their set up shouldn't take more than 10 lines excluding comments. > Dramatically simplify internal wave example. +1! Always good to simplify scripts as much as possible. Would also be nice to include it in the example tests (PR #418) if it can use something like `makeplot = false`. > Free decay of two dimensional turbulence (use x,y plane). Only issue with 2D xy-plane simulations is I think things are weird with `Nz=1` so I had to use `Nz=2` (see Taylor-Green vortex test in `test_dynamics.jl`). 1D and 2D models haven't been a priority unfortunately so this sort of stuff has cropped up. I think 2D xz and yz simulations are fine with `Ny=1` and `Nx=1` respectively. > Stratified Couette flow example. I can simplify the simulation script from PR #381 down to a 2D example. This one would be good. > I think we should split deepening mixed layer into a few examples. Sound like a good idea!

Testability,"I'd like to resurrect this issue. We've implemented 5, but we don't have callbacks.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: I'm not sure. I'm not very familiar with the testing part of Oceananigans, so I'm not sure what would be a good test for this. Just testing that `min_Δz` works seems too specific, on the other hand, creating a whole simulation with a stretched grid and running it with an LES and adaptive time-stepping just to test that seems wasteful. I'm happy to just merge this for now and create a test for this in the future. Thoughts?. CC @glwagner @ali-ramadhan

Testability,I'm ok with removing `Function` here by the way. I don't think we need a test for it --- those tests are in Julia Base (ie we don't need to test that callable objects are possible). Why is `<:Function` there anyways?. The only thing I can think of is that users have to subtype `<:Function` for this to work and maybe that makes code more legible. But it's a restriction of `StructForcing` also has to subtype something else. So I would actually be in favor of removing the `<:Forcing` restriction.

Testability,"I've had a go at implementing a proper NPZD model (rather than one I just made up on the fly) and have some thoughts on how we should modify the API:; - I think we need an `required_biogeochemical_auxiliary_fields` like `required_biogeochemical_tracers` because for most models we're going to want the user to at least specify a PAR field (I suppose we may want this to also check the shape of the field because some models may have a pre defined depth dependence of PAR so we might want the user to specify a 2D PAR field rather than doing it properly by integrating a 3D field); - Given what you said the other day about callbacks only being used for features that should be built into Oceananigans we might want to have a think about how a BGC model can specify the attenuation of PAR. You've mentioned that we could define some kind of integrated field?; - It might be helpful to have a simpler interface for advection in biogeochemical models. Although a user could just add another forcing, I think the only way for a model to automatically add an advective forcing is how I've implimented it in the below example.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: I've had a go at implementing a proper NPZD model (rather than one I just made up on the fly) and have some thoughts on how we should modify the API:; - I think we need an `required_biogeochemical_auxiliary_fields` like `required_biogeochemical_tracers` because for most models we're going to want the user to at least specify a PAR field (I suppose we may want this to also check the shape of the field because some models may have a pre defined depth dependence of PAR so we might want the user to specify a 2D PAR field rather than doing it properly by integrating a 3D field); - Given what you said the other day about callbacks only being used for features that should be built into Oceananigans we might want to have a think about how a BGC model can specify the attenuation of PAR. You've mentioned that we could define some kind of integrated field?; - It might be helpful to have a simpler interface for advection in biogeochemical models. Although a user could just add another forcing, I think the only way for a model to automatically add an advective forcing is how I've implimented it in the below example. I Think this works quite well since a lot of BGC models write the sinking terms with the other forcing terms, but its a little cumbersome to write e.g. `sinking = div_Uc(i, j, k, grid, bgc.adv_scheme, bgc.u⃗ᵖ, fields.P)`, and model makers will need to do the setup stuff I've done to make the advective velocity fields.

The flux divergence for constant isotropic diffusivity, for example, is now. https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/606d40444038d058e32be71655a7239986114a56/src/TurbulenceClosures/constant_isotropic_diffusivity.jl#L42.

This PR required inferring the length of a Tuple of different element types on the GPU (which is not necessarily easy).; I found a hack to do it, but I was working in julia 1.7.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: In my last PR (#2335) I introduced tupled halo filling. . This PR required inferring the length of a Tuple of different element types on the GPU (which is not necessarily easy).; I found a hack to do it, but I was working in julia 1.7. Today, running a simulation with several different functional boundary conditions (in `discrete_form`) with julia 1.6, I found out that the compiler does not like my solution and does not infer the Tuple length (spitting out an `Invalid LLVM` error). This error is not there in julia-1.7. Unfortunately, I already merged my PR because I stupidly did not think to test all possible BC with julia-1.6. Now, to revert to a non-tupled halo filling which works across julia distribution it's a one-liner (in `field_tuples.jl`); ```; @inline fill_halo_regions_field_tuple!(full_fields, grid, args...; kwargs...) = ; fill_halo_regions!(extract_field_data.(full_fields), extract_field_bcs.(full_fields), grid, args...; kwargs...); ```; to; ```; @inline fill_halo_regions_field_tuple!(full_fields, grid, args...; kwargs...) = ; for field in full_fields; fill_halo_regions!(field, args...; kwargs...); end; end; ```. What should we do? We could change this line and leave the infrastructure intact for when we update to julia-1.7 (then we would't have tupled halo filling till then) or find a completely different solution (which will require a lot of restructuring); Probably we also need more tests for boundary conditions with different BC on different sides.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: In the latest commit I added in the shallow water strong and weak and GPU scaling results. I also added in the nonhydrostatic CPU vs GPU results.; I feel like that certain graphs, such as the time graphs for the CPU vs GPU benchmarks may be unnecessary and can be removed, if anyone feels the same way then I'll go ahead and do it.; Other benchmarks yet to be added include the nonhydrostatic strong scaling results and the multithreading results. I am not sure if we think that the multithreading results are good enough to show yet. I personally think that there's room for improvement but current efficiencies are good enough to show already.

Testability,"In this case if we see convergence with decreasing time-step (spatial resolution isn't relevant for these dynamics, which are at the grid scale and therefore not physical) then I suppose that would be an indication the issue is due to a finite time step. It's important to recognize that the dynamics of the _discrete_ linear equations are different than the continuous. When we have a smooth solution, such that our spatial discretization should approximate some exact smooth solution, we can test that refining the grid and time step leads to convergence to an exact solution. Moreover, we can estimate the time-scale of the dynamics using the time-scales of the smooth dynamics as a guide. An example is a resolved buoyancy oscillation: it has a timescale of roughly 1/N. This example is dominated by small amplitude (eg linear) noise at the grid scale. Therefore my initial time scale estimate of 1/N may not hold. Instead, we'd have to look at the discrete eigenvalues of the system at the very higheset wavenumbers (ie the Nyquist number 2pi / dx). We could then calculate the time-step that would be required to resolve these (completely unphysical) dynamics. I'm not sure what a lower bound on such spurious discrete dynamics might be. It could be far smaller than any physical time scale, ie as small as 1e-16, or smaller? Perhaps the evolution of grid scale noise also has to do with spatial resolution, so that could be another knob to vary. So if we want to investigate this further, we should conduct a systematic study of the dynamics of this grid-scale noise system affected by buoyancy, decreasing the time-step to zero. Or we can convince ourselves that non-noisy dynamics _are_ accurate --- eg by analyzing a system like the one we use for our ""internal wave"" dynamics test:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/test/test_internal_wave_dynamics.jl. that test verifies that a wave packet in our code propagates at the correct group speed, for example.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Inspired by the recent activity in #1770, @hennyg888 and I both tried running `benchmark_incompressible_model.jl` with advection set to `WENO5` to learn what the speed up is for this advection scheme from CPUS to GPUS. In the first resolution, `N=32`, it runs on a `CPU` without any problem. However, when it starts to run on a `GPU` there is an error, which is copied below. . When I copy the lines directly into `REPL` to define the grid, model and do one time step, I don't get an error. Any ideas what might be going wrong in this benchmarking example?. ```; [2021/06/28 09:40:32.366] INFO Benchmarking 1/16: (CPU, Float32, 32)...; [2021/06/28 09:40:38.930] WARN Inflating model grid halo size to (3, 3, 3) and recreating grid.

Testability,Is it true that the [different cosine transforms](http://www.fftw.org/doc/1d-Real_002deven-DFTs-_0028DCTs_0029.html) differ in their definition of the collocation points?. Where is the pressure stored in `z`? At cell centers? So your grid extends from `z=-dz/2` to `z=-H+dz/2`?

However, you know much more about this than I do. Even with a gradual climb in forcing at the beginning of the run, how would you recommend improving the settings? Can I initialize the Eulerian-mean flow with noise? Or just run a different, more formal spin up case and then initialize from that? . Thanks so much for your help, this is my first time working with an LES so I am very green.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: It's better to use `Field` for boundary conditions rather than `Array` --- this eliminates translation issues when switching architectures (eg CPU, to GPU, to multi-region, to distributed), and also allows diagnostics to be performed directly on the boundary conditions (which isn't always needed, but is very welcome to have available --- for example the spatial derivative of a flux). So, I think we should declare that it's ""best practice"" to use `Field`, not `Array`. To encourage this we should change the docs that show how to use an `Array`:. https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/model_setup/boundary_conditions/#.-A-random,-spatially-varying,-constant-in-time-temperature-flux-specified-by-an-array. to using a `Field`. Also, we should add correctness tests for using `Field`, which has a bug up until #3287. Curious about @simone-silvestri's input because he has used arrays a lot in boundary conditions. Note that we also are working on support for `FieldTimeSeries` as a boundary condition in #3233 .

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: It's still a good idea to test that the docs have recorded the behavior of `show` correctly, however. Developers may change `show` in the future but forget to / incorrectly update the docstring. The `AbstractOperations` module adds a ton of functionality that can benefit from `REPL`-based experimentation. We could experiment with returning a bit more information from functions to make `Oceananigans` more REPL friendly. For example, the `push!` operator defined in julia base returns the array that it modified --- even though unnecessary, this triggers `show` for that array at the REPL and shows the user that their array has a new element.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Just adding here as a small reminder: . Currently the split-explicit scheme does not seem to conserve to machine precision the free-surface height average (as it should). In the current iteration it only conserves to 8 digits. This is only when it is implemented as a part of the hydrostatic model. In a standalone test it does seem to conserve to machine precision. Once this issue is isolated and fixed I'd say it's good to go for merging

Testability,"Last TODO item for the JOSS paper. Was going to include the convergence tests as part of `test_verification.jl` but in cleaning them up (mostly by relying on the version of Oceananigans in the repository, `using .ConvergenceTests` as a local module, and making sure legends don't block off the plots) I noticed that the 2D convergence tests are all failing now. Pretty sure this must be a stupid mistake as they were all converging correctly as of Oceananigans v0.30.0 but haven't tried to figure out what went wrong yet... Since they're kinda important now I'm thinking we should have a test job that just runs all the convergence tests, tests that the order of convergence is as expected, and produces all the convergence plots so we can look at them.

Testability,"Let me summarize my findings in the commit 4841c96. I wrote a new script test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl to verify the correct halo filling for scalar fields at locations cca, fca, cfa, and ffa. I manually filled out the halos of the parent (off-set) array and compared them against the halos of the array filled out with the fill_halo_regions! function. At the ffa locations, the tests fail for all halos. At the cca, fca, and cfa locations, the tests fail for (a) the north and west halos of the odd-numbered panels 1, 3, 5 (with non-trivial connectivities), and (b) the south and east halos of the even-numbered panels 2, 4, 6 (with non-trivial connectivities). The tests which fail are currently commented out in the script test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl. After some digging, I found out that both the latitude and longitude values are not correctly defined on these halos. . To delve into the root of the issue, I first replace the line ; ```julia; Ψᵣ(λ, φ, z) = - U * R * (sind(φ) * cosd(α) - cosd(λ) * cosd(φ) * sind(α)); ```; with; ```julia; Ψᵣ(λ, φ, z) = λ ; ```; in test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl, and run the script:; ```julia; julia> include(""test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl""); ```; Then I type the following commands over the terminal and study the output:; ```julia; julia> Nx, Ny, Nz = 3, 3, 1; (3, 3, 1). julia> grid = ConformalCubedSphereGrid(panel_size = (Nx, Ny, Nz), z = (0, 1), radius = 1, horizontal_direction_halo = 3, z_halo = 1); ConformalCubedSphereGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, FullyConnected, Bounded} partitioned on CPU():; ├── grids: 3×3×1 OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, FullyConnected, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×1 halo and with precomputed metrics; ├── partitioning: CubedSpherePartition with (1 region in each panel); ├── connectivity: CubedSphereConnectivity; └── devices: (CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU()). julia> data_1 = create_c_test_data(grid); Cubed",test,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3280#issuecomment-1743842511:73,test,73,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3280#issuecomment-1743842511,5,['test'],"['test', 'tests']","The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection.

I wrote a new script test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl to verify the correct halo filling for scalar fields at locations cca, fca, cfa, and ffa. I manually filled out the halos of the parent (off-set) array and compared them against the halos of the array filled out with the fill_halo_regions! function. At the ffa locations, the tests fail for all halos. At the cca, fca, and cfa locations, the tests fail for (a) the north and west halos of the odd-numbered panels 1, 3, 5 (with non-trivial connectivities), and (b) the south and east halos of the even-numbered panels 2, 4, 6 (with non-trivial connectivities). The tests which fail are currently commented out in the script test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl. After some digging, I found out that both the latitude and longitude values are not correctly defined on these halos. . To delve into the root of the issue, I first replace the line ; ```julia; Ψᵣ(λ, φ, z) = - U * R * (sind(φ) * cosd(α) - cosd(λ) * cosd(φ) * sind(α)); ```; with; ```julia; Ψᵣ(λ, φ, z) = λ ; ```; in test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl, and run the script:; ```julia; julia> include(""test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl""); ```; Then I type the following commands over the terminal and study the output:; ```julia; julia> Nx, Ny, Nz = 3, 3, 1; (3, 3, 1). julia> grid = ConformalCubedSphereGrid(panel_size = (Nx, Ny, Nz), z = (0, 1), radius = 1, horizontal_direction_halo = 3, z_halo = 1); ConformalCubedSphereGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, FullyConnected, Bounded} partitioned on CPU():; ├── grids: 3×3×1 OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, FullyConnected, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×1 halo and with precomputed metrics; ├── partitioning: CubedSpherePartition with (1 region in each panel); ├── connectivity: CubedSphereConnectivity; └── devices: (CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU()). julia> data_1 = create_c_test_data(grid); Cubed

Testability,"Looking at performance benchmarks, Float32 is slower than Float64 on the CPU. I suspect something is being done wrong somewhere maybe. I have a few ideas:; 1. Those benchmarks were run on Google Cloud where the virtual CPUs aren't very performant so I thought it was maybe just a low-end 64-bit CPU where Float32 operations were emulated via Float64 operations resulting in fewer FLOPS. However, even on my own laptop I found Float32 on a CPU to be a bit slower, but just by 5-10% whereas on Google Cloud it was like 30%+ slower.; 2. It's likely that Float32 is still being mixed with Float64, and maybe this slows the code down due to too many implicit conversions? (Somewhat related to #34).; 3. Unlikely but I wonder if this is a Julia issue... I could perhaps run some simple C code to see if it's a hardware thing or just a weird Julia thing.; 4. I thought it looked fine on the GPU as you do see a ""speedup"" of 10-15% which I took to mean that we were memory bandwidth/latency limited (which is probably true). The V100 GPUs have twice as many FP32 units as they do FP64 units and if FP32 operations are faster, then I expect more than just a 10-15% speedup.

Testability,"New log level should be enough if we just need flat per-iteration timings to time a few blocks for a few iterations. Are you thinking of just logging raw `@time` data?. I'm not sure if we need anything more than a new log level, but I imagine some of the benefits of using a package like TimerOutputs.jl would make the timer blocks much more useful for debugging and for users. It allows for nested timers and produces a very nice table summary at the end which includes number of calls and average time/memory allocations. This could also be useful for users wishing to time their simulations to figure out how much time is being spent on I/O vs. in kernels vs. solvers vs. callbacks, etc. I guess I also see timers as a debugging tool for users. Could help be figure out cluster filesystem issues or figure out whether Oceananigans or my coupled model (via callback) is the bottleneck. Otherwise if the timers are just a developer debugging tool that dumps timing information, that's useful but it might not be useful for timing real-world scripts/simulations since the log would fill up with a huge number of lines that can't be interpreted without further processing. Here's an example of it in use: https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/149#issuecomment-461943376 (CUDA.jl has been using TimerOutputs.jl for a long time I think).

It allows for nested timers and produces a very nice table summary at the end which includes number of calls and average time/memory allocations. This could also be useful for users wishing to time their simulations to figure out how much time is being spent on I/O vs. in kernels vs. solvers vs. callbacks, etc. I guess I also see timers as a debugging tool for users. Could help be figure out cluster filesystem issues or figure out whether Oceananigans or my coupled model (via callback) is the bottleneck. Otherwise if the timers are just a developer debugging tool that dumps timing information, that's useful but it might not be useful for timing real-world scripts/simulations since the log would fill up with a huge number of lines that can't be interpreted without further processing. Here's an example of it in use: https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/149#issuecomment-461943376 (CUDA.jl has been using TimerOutputs.jl for a long time I think). TimerOutputs.jl is easy to use since you just add `@timeit` blocks but that does add some noise to the code (not sure if more or less than using a timing log level).

Testability,"Ok I think I figured it out. The `Float64` values are coming in from functions like `depthᶜᶜᶠ` and `height_above_bottomᶜᶜᶠ`. The main issue is actually the grid coordinates not being fully `Float32`. In particular, when coordinates like `grid.zᵃᵃᶜ` are ranges the reference and step size are `Float64`:. ```julia; julia> r = range(0.0f0, 1.0f0, 16); 0.0f0:0.06666667f0:1.0f0. julia> typeof(r); StepRangeLen{Float32, Float64, Float64, Int64}; ```.

Doing this in `grid_coordinates.jl` fixes the MWE. Curiously this behavior of `range` is not mentioned in the docs for `range` or `StepRangeLen` but is discussed on the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/the-type-of-a-range-step-defined-as-float32-changes-to-float64/27411). Well looks like it was briefly mentioned in the `StepRangeLen` docstring in 2019. The step size being twice the precision is supposed to help with rounding errors. But maybe on the GPU it can do more harm than good?. I can see how this leads to type promotion to `Float64` but I'm not totally sure how having a `Float64` reference and step size leads to illegal memory accesses.
