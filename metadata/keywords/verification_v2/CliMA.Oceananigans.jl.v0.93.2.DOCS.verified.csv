When `pickup=true` is provided to `run!` then it finds the latest checkpoint file in the current working; directory, loads prognostic fields and their tendencies from file, resets the model clock and iteration,; to the clock time and iteration that the checkpoint corresponds to, and updates the model auxiliary state.; After that, the time-stepping loop. In this simple example, although the simulation run up to iteration 8,; the latest checkpoint is associated with iteration 5. ```@repl checkpointing; simulation.stop_iteration = 12. run!(simulation, pickup=true); ```. Use `pickup=iteration`, where `iteration` is an `Integer`, to pick up from a specific iteration.; Or, use `pickup=filepath`, where `filepath` is a string, to pickup from a specific file located; at `filepath`.;

Content: # [Turbulence closures](@id numerical_closures). To truly simulate and resolve turbulence at high Reynolds number (so basically all interesting flows) would require; you resolve all motions down to the [Kolmogorov41](@citet) length scale ``\eta = (\nu^3 / \varepsilon)^{1/4}`` where; ``\nu`` is the kinematic viscosity and ``\varepsilon`` the average rate of dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy per; unit mass. As pointed out way back by [Corrsin61](@citet), to run a simulation on a horizontal domain about 10 times the size of an; ""average eddy"" with 100 vertical levels and where the grid spacing is given by ``\eta`` would require the computer to; store on the order of ``10^{14}`` variables.[^1] This is still impractical today, although may be within; reach in less than a decade. He ends by suggesting the use of an analog rather digital computer---a tank of water. [^1]: And even then, ``\eta`` gives the *maximum* allowable grid spacing. There is significant flow structure; smaller than ``\eta``. To have any hope of simulating high Reynolds number flows we need some way of resolving the sub-grid scale motions.[^2].

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: ``4 \times 4 \times 2``.; Note that length units are whatever is used to construct the grid, so it's up to the user to make sure that all inputs use consistent units. In building our first grid, we did not specify whether it should be constructed on the [`CPU`](@ref)` or [`GPU`](@ref).; As a result, the grid was constructed by default on the CPU.; Next we build a grid on the _GPU_ that's two-dimensional in ``x, z`` and has variably-spaced cell interfaces in the `z`-direction,. ```jldoctest grids_gpu; architecture = GPU(); z_faces = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]. grid = RectilinearGrid(architecture,; topology = (Periodic, Flat, Bounded),; size = (10, 4),; x = (0, 20),; z = z_faces). # output; 10×1×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Flat, Bounded} on GPU with 3×0×3 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 20.0) regularly spaced with Δx=2.0; ├── Flat y; └── Bounded z ∈ [0.0, 10.0] variably spaced with min(Δz)=1.0, max(Δz)=4.0; ```. !!! note ""GPU architecture requires a CUDA-enabled device""; To run the above example and create a grid on the GPU, an Nvidia GPU has to be available; and [`CUDA.jl`](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/) must be working). For more information; see the [`CUDA.jl` documentation](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/). The ``y``-dimension is ""missing"" because it's marked `Flat` in `topology = (Periodic, Flat, Bounded)`.; So nothing varies in ``y``: `y`-derivatives are 0.; Also, the keyword argument (or ""kwarg"" for short) that specifies the ``y``-domains may be omitted, and `size` has only two elements rather than 3 as in the first example.; In the stretched cell interfaces specified by `z_interfaces`, the number of; vertical cell interfaces is `Nz + 1 = length(z_interfaces) = 5`, where `Nz = 4` is the number; of cells in the vertical. A bit later in this tutorial, we'll give examples that illustrate how to build a grid thats [`Distributed`](@ref) across _multiple_ CPUs and GPUs. ## Grid types: squares, shells, and mountains.

Caution is advised when ``𝐮_{\rm slip}`` is not divergence free. As an example, consider a model for sediment settling at a constant rate:. ```jldoctest; using Oceananigans. r_sediment = 1e-4 # [m] ""Fine sand""; ρ_sediment = 1200 # kg m⁻³; ρ_ocean = 1026 # kg m⁻³; Δb = 9.81 * (ρ_

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: # Oceananigans.jl. *🌊 Fast and friendly fluid dynamics on CPUs and GPUs.*. Oceananigans is a fast, friendly, flexible software package for finite volume simulations of the nonhydrostatic; and hydrostatic Boussinesq equations on CPUs and GPUs.; It runs on GPUs (wow, fast!), though we believe Oceananigans makes the biggest waves; with its ultra-flexible user interface that makes simple simulations easy, and complex, creative simulations possible. Oceananigans is written in Julia by the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu); and heroic external collaborators. ## Quick install.

Oceananigans is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it,. 1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (version 1.9 or later). 2. Launch Julia and type. ```julia; julia> using Pkg. julia> Pkg.add(""Oceananigans""); ```. This installs the latest version that's _compatible with your current environment_.; Don't forget to *be careful* 🏄 and check which Oceananigans you installed:. ```julia; julia> Pkg.status(""Oceananigans""); ```. ## Running your first model. Let's run a two-dimensional, horizontally-periodic simulation of turbulence using 128² finite volume cells for 4 non-dimensional time units:. ```julia; using Oceananigans; grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size=(128, 128), x=(0, 2π), y=(0, 2π), topology=(Periodic, Periodic, Flat)); model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, advection=WENO()); ϵ(x, y) = 2rand() - 1; set!(model, u=ϵ, v=ϵ); simulation = Simulation(model; Δt=0.01, stop_time=4); run!(simulation); ```. But there's more: changing `CPU()` to `GPU()` makes this code run on a CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPU.

Content: 309.06662)), though we believe Oceananigans makes the biggest waves; with its ultra-flexible user interface that makes simple simulations easy, and complex, creative simulations possible. Oceananigans.jl is developed by the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu) and heroic external collaborators. ## Contents. - [Contents](#contents); - [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions); - [Running your first model](#running-your-first-model); - [The Oceananigans knowledge base](#the-oceananigans-knowledge-base); - [Citing](#citing); - [Contributing](#contributing); - [Movies](#movies); - [Deep convection](#deep-convection); - [Free convection](#free-convection); - [Winds blowing over the ocean](#winds-blowing-over-the-ocean); - [Free convection with wind stress](#free-convection-with-wind-stress); - [Performance benchmarks](#performance-benchmarks). ## Installation instructions. Oceananigans is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it,. 1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (version 1.9 or later). 2. Launch Julia and type. ```julia; julia> using Pkg. julia> Pkg.add(""Oceananigans""); ```. This installs the latest version that's _compatible with your current environment_.; Don't forget to *be careful* 🏄 and check which Oceananigans you installed:. ```julia; julia> Pkg.status(""Oceananigans""); ```. ## Running your first model. Let's run a two-dimensional, horizontally-periodic simulation of turbulence using 128² finite volume cells for 4 non-dimensional time units:. ```julia; using Oceananigans; grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size=(128, 128), x=(0, 2π), y=(0, 2π), topology=(Periodic, Periodic, Flat)); model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, advection=WENO()); ϵ(x, y) = 2rand() - 1; set!(model, u=ϵ, v=ϵ); simulation = Simulation(model; Δt=0.01, stop_time=4); run!(simulation); ```. But there's more: changing `CPU()` to `GPU()` makes this code run on a CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPU. Dive into [the documentation

Deployability,"e the projection ; of the equation right hand side onto eigenvectors. So an eigenvector based approach to solving; the Poisson equation is not computationally efficient. For problems with grids that are non uniform in multiple directions, we use instead a pre-conditioned conjugate; gradient iterative solver. Such cases include curvilinear grids on the sphere and also telescoping cartesian; grids that stretch along more than one dimension. There are two forms of the pressure operator in this approach.; One is rigid lid form and one is an implicit free-surface form. ### Rigid lid pressure operator. The rigid lid operator is based on the same continuous form as is used in the Direct Method; solver. ### Implicit free surface pressure operator. The implicit free surface solver solves for the free-surface, ``\eta(x, y, t)``, in the vertically; integrated continuity equation:. ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity}; \partial_t \eta + \partial_x \left ( \int_{-H}^0 u \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) + \partial_y \left ( \int_{-H}^0 v \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) = M \, ,; \end{equation}; ```. where ``H(x, y)`` is the depth of the water column (to first order with respect to the free surface; elevation) and ``M`` is some surface volume flux (e.g., terms such as precipitation, evaporation and; runoff); currently Oceananigans.jl assumes ``M = 0``. Note that in deriving \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity},; we used the bottom boundary condition ``w_{\rm bottom} = \boldsymbol{u}_{\rm bottom} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla}_h H``. To form a linear system that can be solved implicitly we recast the vertically-integrated continuity; equation \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity} into a discrete integral form. The best way to do; so is by starting from the discrete version of the continuity equation (in this case without any surface; volume flux, ``M = 0``). ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:continuity-discrete}; \delta_x (A_x u) + \delta_y (A_y",integrat,MatchSource.DOCS,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers.md:12286,integrated-continuity,12286,docs/src/numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers.md,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers.md,1,['integrat'],['integrated-continuity'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: e the projection ; of the equation right hand side onto eigenvectors. So an eigenvector based approach to solving; the Poisson equation is not computationally efficient. For problems with grids that are non uniform in multiple directions, we use instead a pre-conditioned conjugate; gradient iterative solver. Such cases include curvilinear grids on the sphere and also telescoping cartesian; grids that stretch along more than one dimension. There are two forms of the pressure operator in this approach.; One is rigid lid form and one is an implicit free-surface form. ### Rigid lid pressure operator. The rigid lid operator is based on the same continuous form as is used in the Direct Method; solver. ### Implicit free surface pressure operator. The implicit free surface solver solves for the free-surface, ``\eta(x, y, t)``, in the vertically; integrated continuity equation:. ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity}; \partial_t \eta + \partial_x \left ( \int_{-H}^0 u \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) + \partial_y \left ( \int_{-H}^0 v \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) = M \, ,; \end{equation}; ```. where ``H(x, y)`` is the depth of the water column (to first order with respect to the free surface; elevation) and ``M`` is some surface volume flux (e.g., terms such as precipitation, evaporation and; runoff); currently Oceananigans.jl assumes ``M = 0``. Note that in deriving \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity},; we used the bottom boundary condition ``w_{\rm bottom} = \boldsymbol{u}_{\rm bottom} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla}_h H``. To form a linear system that can be solved implicitly we recast the vertically-integrated continuity; equation \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity} into a discrete integral form. The best way to do; so is by starting from the discrete version of the continuity equation (in this case without any surface; volume flux, ``M = 0``). ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:continuity-discrete}; \delta_x (A_x u) + \delta_y (A_y

Oceananigans is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it,. 1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (version 1.9 or later). 2. Launch Julia and type. ```julia; julia> using Pkg. julia> Pkg.add(""Oceananigans""); ```. This installs the latest version that's _compatible with your current environment_.; Don't forget to *be careful* 🏄 and check which Oceananigans you installed:. ```julia; julia> Pkg.status(""Oceananigans""); ```. ## Running your first model. Let's run a two-dimensional, horizontally-periodic simulation of turbulence using 128² finite volume cells for 4 non-dimensional time units:. ```julia; using Oceananigans; grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size=(128, 128), x=(0, 2π), y=(0, 2π), topology=(Periodic, Periodic, Flat)); model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, advection=WENO()); ϵ(x, y) = 2rand() - 1; set!(model, u=ϵ, v=ϵ); simulation = Simulation(model; Δt=0.01, stop_time=4); run!(simulation); ```. But there's more: changing `CPU()` to `GPU()` makes this code run on a CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPU. Dive into [the documentation](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/) for more code examples and tutorials.; Below, you'll find movies from GPU simulations along with CPU and GPU [performance benchmarks](https://github.com/clima/Oceananigans.jl#performance-benchmarks). ## The Oceananigans knowledge base.

Deployability,"ular grids the eigenvectors of the discrete Poisson operator are no longer simple Fourier; series sines and cosines. This means discrete Fast Fourier Transforms can't be used to generate the projection ; of the equation right hand side onto eigenvectors. So an eigenvector based approach to solving; the Poisson equation is not computationally efficient. For problems with grids that are non uniform in multiple directions, we use instead a pre-conditioned conjugate; gradient iterative solver. Such cases include curvilinear grids on the sphere and also telescoping cartesian; grids that stretch along more than one dimension. There are two forms of the pressure operator in this approach.; One is rigid lid form and one is an implicit free-surface form. ### Rigid lid pressure operator. The rigid lid operator is based on the same continuous form as is used in the Direct Method; solver. ### Implicit free surface pressure operator. The implicit free surface solver solves for the free-surface, ``\eta(x, y, t)``, in the vertically; integrated continuity equation:. ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity}; \partial_t \eta + \partial_x \left ( \int_{-H}^0 u \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) + \partial_y \left ( \int_{-H}^0 v \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) = M \, ,; \end{equation}; ```. where ``H(x, y)`` is the depth of the water column (to first order with respect to the free surface; elevation) and ``M`` is some surface volume flux (e.g., terms such as precipitation, evaporation and; runoff); currently Oceananigans.jl assumes ``M = 0``.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: ular grids the eigenvectors of the discrete Poisson operator are no longer simple Fourier; series sines and cosines. This means discrete Fast Fourier Transforms can't be used to generate the projection ; of the equation right hand side onto eigenvectors. So an eigenvector based approach to solving; the Poisson equation is not computationally efficient. For problems with grids that are non uniform in multiple directions, we use instead a pre-conditioned conjugate; gradient iterative solver. Such cases include curvilinear grids on the sphere and also telescoping cartesian; grids that stretch along more than one dimension. There are two forms of the pressure operator in this approach.; One is rigid lid form and one is an implicit free-surface form. ### Rigid lid pressure operator. The rigid lid operator is based on the same continuous form as is used in the Direct Method; solver. ### Implicit free surface pressure operator. The implicit free surface solver solves for the free-surface, ``\eta(x, y, t)``, in the vertically; integrated continuity equation:. ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity}; \partial_t \eta + \partial_x \left ( \int_{-H}^0 u \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) + \partial_y \left ( \int_{-H}^0 v \, \mathrm{d}z \right ) = M \, ,; \end{equation}; ```. where ``H(x, y)`` is the depth of the water column (to first order with respect to the free surface; elevation) and ``M`` is some surface volume flux (e.g., terms such as precipitation, evaporation and; runoff); currently Oceananigans.jl assumes ``M = 0``. Note that in deriving \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity},; we used the bottom boundary condition ``w_{\rm bottom} = \boldsymbol{u}_{\rm bottom} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla}_h H``. To form a linear system that can be solved implicitly we recast the vertically-integrated continuity; equation \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity} into a discrete integral form.

Energy Efficiency,"# [Simulation tips](@id simulation_tips). Oceananigans attempts to optimize computations as much as possible ""behind the scenes"".; Yet Oceananigans' flexibility places some responsibility on users to ensure high performance simulations,; especially for complex setups with user-defined forcing functions, boundary condition functions, and diagnostics.; Furthermore, in case of more complex GPU runs, some details could; sometimes prevent your simulation from running altogether. While Julia knowledge is obviously; desirable here, a user that is unfamiliar with Julia can get away with efficient simulations by; learning a few rules of thumb. It is nonetheless recommended that users go through Julia's; [performance tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/), which contains more; in-depth explanations of some of the aspects discussed here. ## General (CPU/GPU) simulation tips. ### Avoid global variables whenever possible. In general using a [global; variable](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables-and-scoping/#Global-Scope) (which can be; loosely defined as a variable defined in the main script) inside functions slows down the code. One; way to circumvent this is to always [use local variables or pass them as arguments to; functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-global-variables). This; helps the compiler optimize the code. Another way around this is to [define global variables as constants whenever; possible](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-global-variables).

Content: # [Simulation tips](@id simulation_tips). Oceananigans attempts to optimize computations as much as possible ""behind the scenes"".; Yet Oceananigans' flexibility places some responsibility on users to ensure high performance simulations,; especially for complex setups with user-defined forcing functions, boundary condition functions, and diagnostics.; Furthermore, in case of more complex GPU runs, some details could; sometimes prevent your simulation from running altogether. While Julia knowledge is obviously; desirable here, a user that is unfamiliar with Julia can get away with efficient simulations by; learning a few rules of thumb. It is nonetheless recommended that users go through Julia's; [performance tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/), which contains more; in-depth explanations of some of the aspects discussed here. ## General (CPU/GPU) simulation tips. ### Avoid global variables whenever possible. In general using a [global; variable](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables-and-scoping/#Global-Scope) (which can be; loosely defined as a variable defined in the main script) inside functions slows down the code. One; way to circumvent this is to always [use local variables or pass them as arguments to; functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-global-variables). This; helps the compiler optimize the code. Another way around this is to [define global variables as constants whenever; possible](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-global-variables). One; thing to keep in mind when doing this is that when a `const` is defined, its value can't be changed; until you restart the Julia session. So this latter approach is good for production-ready code, but; may be undesirable in the early stages of development while you still have to change the parameters; of the simulation for exploration.

The `Flat` topology comes in handy when running problems with fewer than 3 dimensions. As an example,; to use a two-dimensional horizontal, doubly periodic domain the topology is `(Periodic, Periodic, Flat)`.; In that case, the `size` and `extent` are 2-tuples, e.g.,. ```jldoctest; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Flat), size = (32, 32), extent = (10, 20)); 32×32×1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Flat} on CPU with 3×3×0 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 10.0) regularly spaced with Δx=0.3125; ├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 20.0) regularly spaced with Δy=0.625; └── Flat z; ```. ### Specifying domain end points. To specify a domain with a different origin than the default, the `x`, `y`, and `z` keyword arguments must be used.; For example, a grid with ``x \in [-100, 100]`` meters, ``y \in [0, 12.5]`` meters, and ``z \in [-\pi, \pi]`` meters; is constructed via. ```jldoctest; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (32, 16, 256), x = (-100, 100), y = (0, 12.5), z = (-π, π)); 32×16×256 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [-100.0, 100.0) regularly spaced with Δx=6.25; ├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 12.5) regularly spaced with Δy=0.78125; └── Bounded z ∈ [-3.14159, 3.14159] regularly spaced with Δz=0.0245437; ```. ### Grids with non-regular spacing in some of the directions. For a ""channel"" model, as the one we constructed above, one would probably like to have finer resolution near; the channel walls. We construct a grid that has non-regular spacing in the bounded dimensions, here ``y`` and ``z``; by prescribing functions for `y` and `z` keyword arguments. For example, we can use the Chebychev nodes, which are more closely stacked near boundaries, to prescribe the; ``y``- and ``z``-faces. ```jldoctest; julia> Nx, Ny, Nz = 64, 64, 32;. julia> Lx, Ly, Lz = 1e4, 1e4, ",meter,MatchSource.DOCS,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/model_setup/legacy_grids.md:4027,meters,4027,docs/src/model_setup/legacy_grids.md,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/model_setup/legacy_grids.md,2,['meter'],['meters'],"The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance.

As an example,; to use a two-dimensional horizontal, doubly periodic domain the topology is `(Periodic, Periodic, Flat)`.; In that case, the `size` and `extent` are 2-tuples, e.g.,. ```jldoctest; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Flat), size = (32, 32), extent = (10, 20)); 32×32×1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Flat} on CPU with 3×3×0 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 10.0) regularly spaced with Δx=0.3125; ├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 20.0) regularly spaced with Δy=0.625; └── Flat z; ```. ### Specifying domain end points. To specify a domain with a different origin than the default, the `x`, `y`, and `z` keyword arguments must be used.; For example, a grid with ``x \in [-100, 100]`` meters, ``y \in [0, 12.5]`` meters, and ``z \in [-\pi, \pi]`` meters; is constructed via. ```jldoctest; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (32, 16, 256), x = (-100, 100), y = (0, 12.5), z = (-π, π)); 32×16×256 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [-100.0, 100.0) regularly spaced with Δx=6.25; ├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 12.5) regularly spaced with Δy=0.78125; └── Bounded z ∈ [-3.14159, 3.14159] regularly spaced with Δz=0.0245437; ```. ### Grids with non-regular spacing in some of the directions. For a ""channel"" model, as the one we constructed above, one would probably like to have finer resolution near; the channel walls. We construct a grid that has non-regular spacing in the bounded dimensions, here ``y`` and ``z``; by prescribing functions for `y` and `z` keyword arguments. For example, we can use the Chebychev nodes, which are more closely stacked near boundaries, to prescribe the; ``y``- and ``z``-faces. ```jldoctest; julia> Nx, Ny, Nz = 64, 64, 32;. julia> Lx, Ly, Lz = 1e4, 1e4,

In particular, as the transforms; are performed on a staggered grid, DCT-II (`REDFT10`) is used to perform the forward cosine transform and DCT-III; (`REDFT01`) is used to perform the inverse cosine transform. ## Direct method with a vertically stretched grid. Using Fourier transforms for all three dimensions results in a method requiring ``\mathcal{O}(N \log_2 N)`` operations; where ``N`` is the total number of grid points. This algorithm can be made even more efficient by solving a tridiagonal; system along one of the dimensions and utilizing cyclic reduction. This results in the *Fourier analysis cyclic; reduction* or ``\text{FACR}(\ell)`` algorithm (with ``\ell`` cyclic reduction steps) which requires only; ``\mathcal{O}(N \log_2\log_2 N)`` operations provided the optimal number of cyclic reduction steps is taken, which is; ``\ell = \log_2 \log_2 n`` where ``n`` is the number of grid points in the cyclic reduction dimension. The FACR algorithm; was first developed by [Hockney69](@citet) and is well reviewed by [Swarztrauber77](@citet) then further benchmarked and; extended by [Temperton79](@citet) and [Temperton80](@citet). Furthermore, the FACR algorithm removes the restriction that the grid is uniform in one of the dimensions so it can; be utilized to implement a fast Poisson solver for vertically stretched grids if the cyclic reduction is applied in the; along the vertical dimension.

In particular, as the transforms; are performed on a staggered grid, DCT-II (`REDFT10`) is used to perform the forward cosine transform and DCT-III; (`REDFT01`) is used to perform the inverse cosine transform. ## Direct method with a vertically stretched grid. Using Fourier transforms for all three dimensions results in a method requiring ``\mathcal{O}(N \log_2 N)`` operations; where ``N`` is the total number of grid points. This algorithm can be made even more efficient by solving a tridiagonal; system along one of the dimensions and utilizing cyclic reduction. This results in the *Fourier analysis cyclic; reduction* or ``\text{FACR}(\ell)`` algorithm (with ``\ell`` cyclic reduction steps) which requires only; ``\mathcal{O}(N \log_2\log_2 N)`` operations provided the optimal number of cyclic reduction steps is taken, which is; ``\ell = \log_2 \log_2 n`` where ``n`` is the number of grid points in the cyclic reduction dimension. The FACR algorithm; was first developed by [Hockney69](@citet) and is well reviewed by [Swarztrauber77](@citet) then further benchmarked and; extended by [Temperton79](@citet) and [Temperton80](@citet). Furthermore, the FACR algorithm removes the restriction that the grid is uniform in one of the dimensions so it can; be utilized to implement a fast Poisson solver for vertically stretched grids if the cyclic reduction is applied in the; along the vertical dimension. Expanding ``p_{NH}`` and ``\mathscr{F}`` into Fourier modes along the ``x`` and ``y`

With `AveragedTimeInterval`, the time-average of ``a`` is taken as a left Riemann sum corresponding to. ```math; \langle a \rangle = \frac{1}{T} \int_{t_i-T}^{t_i} a \, \mathrm{d} t \, ,; ```. where ``\langle a \rangle`` is the time-average of ``a``, ``T`` is the time-`window` for averaging specified by; the `window` keyword argument to `AveragedTimeInterval`, and the ``t_i`` are discrete times separated by the; time `interval`. The ``t_i`` specify both the end of the averaging window and the time at which output is written. ### Example. Building an `AveragedTimeInterval` that averages over a 1 day window, every 4 days,. ```jldoctest averaged_time_interval; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.Units. schedule = AveragedTimeInterval(4days, window=1day). # output; AveragedTimeInterval(window=1 day, stride=1, interval=4 days); ```.

Saving the u velocity field and temperature fields as full 3D fields, surface 2D slices, and; 1D columns to separate NetCDF files:. ```@example netcdf1; using Oceananigans. grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(16, 16, 16), extent=(1, 1, 1)). model = NonhydrostaticModel(grid=grid, tracers=:c). simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=12, stop_time=3600). fields = Dict(""u"" => model.velocities.u, ""c"" => model.tracers.c). simulation.output_writers[:field_writer] =; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, fields, filename=""more_fields.nc"", schedule=TimeInterval(60)); ```. ```@example netcdf1; simulation.output_writers[:surface_slice_writer] =; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, fields, filename=""another_surface_xy_slice.nc"",; schedule=TimeInterval(60), indices=(:, :, grid.Nz)); ```. ```@example netcdf1; simulation.output_writers[:averaged_profile_writer] =; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, fields,; filename = ""another_averaged_z_profile.nc"",; schedule = AveragedTimeInterval(60, window=20),; indices = (1, 1, :)); ```. `NetCDFOutputWriter` also accepts output functions that write scalars and arrays to disk,; provided that their `dimensions` are provided:. ```@example; using Oceananigans. Nx, Ny, Nz = 16, 16, 16. grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(Nx, Ny, Nz), extent=(1, 2, 3)). model = NonhydrostaticModel(grid=grid). simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1.25, stop_iteration=3). f(model) = model.clock.time^2; # scalar output. g(model) = model.clock.time .* exp.(znodes(grid, Center())) # single-column profile output (vector). xC, yF = xnodes(grid, Center()), ynod

Thus the; SGS stress tensor is given by; ```math; \tau_{ij} = -2 \nu_e \overline{S}_{ij} = -2 (C_s \Delta)^2 |\overline{S}| \overline{S}_{ij} \, ,; ```; where ``C_s`` is a dimensionless constant. The grid spacing is usually used for the characteristic length scale ``\Delta``.; The eddy diffusivities are calculated via ``\kappa_e = \nu_e / \text{Pr}_t`` where the turbulent Prandtl number; ``\text{Pr}_t`` is usually chosen to be ``\mathcal{O}(1)`` from experimental observations. Assuming that the SGS energy cascade is equal to the overall dissipation rate ``\varepsilon`` from the; [Kolmogorov41](@citet) theory, [Lilly66](@citet) was able to derive a value of; ```math; C_s = \left( \frac{3}{2}C_K\pi^\frac{4}{3} \right)^{-\frac{3}{4}} \approx 0.16 \, ,; ```; using an empirical value of ``C_K \approx 1.6`` for the Kolmogorov constant. This seems reasonable for isotropic; turbulence if the grid spacing ``\Delta`` falls in the inertial range. In practice, ``C_s`` is a tunable parameter. Due to the presence of the constant ``C_s``, the model is sometimes referred to as the *constant Smagorinsky* model; in contrast to *dynamic Smagorinsky* models that dynamically compute ``C_s`` to account for effects such as buoyant; convection. ## Anisotropic minimum dissipation models.

Thus the; SGS stress tensor is given by; ```math; \tau_{ij} = -2 \nu_e \overline{S}_{ij} = -2 (C_s \Delta)^2 |\overline{S}| \overline{S}_{ij} \, ,; ```; where ``C_s`` is a dimensionless constant. The grid spacing is usually used for the characteristic length scale ``\Delta``.; The eddy diffusivities are calculated via ``\kappa_e = \nu_e / \text{Pr}_t`` where the turbulent Prandtl number; ``\text{Pr}_t`` is usually chosen to be ``\mathcal{O}(1)`` from experimental observations. Assuming that the SGS energy cascade is equal to the overall dissipation rate ``\varepsilon`` from the; [Kolmogorov41](@citet) theory, [Lilly66](@citet) was able to derive a value of; ```math; C_s = \left( \frac{3}{2}C_K\pi^\frac{4}{3} \right)^{-\frac{3}{4}} \approx 0.16 \, ,; ```; using an empirical value of ``C_K \approx 1.6`` for the Kolmogorov constant. This seems reasonable for isotropic; turbulence if the grid spacing ``\Delta`` falls in the inertial range. In practice, ``C_s`` is a tunable parameter. Due to the presence of the constant ``C_s``, the model is sometimes referred to as the *constant Smagorinsky* model; in contrast to *dynamic Smagorinsky* models that dynamically compute ``C_s`` to account for effects such as buoyant; convection. ## Anisotropic minimum dissipation models. Minimum-dissipation eddy-viscosity models are a class of LES closures that use the minimum eddy dissipation required to; dissipate the energy of sub-grid scale motion. [Rozema15](@citet) proposed the first minimum-dissipation model; appropriate for use on anisotropic grids, termed the *anisotropic minimum dissipation* (AMD) model.

In equations \eqref{eq:nu-dagger}--\eqref{eq:S-hat}, ``C`` is a modified Poincaré ""constant"" that is independent from; the filter width ``\Delta`` but does depend on the accuracy of the discretization method used. [Abkar16](@citet) cite; ``C^2 = \frac{1}{12}`` for a spectral method and ``C^2 = \frac{1}{3}`` for a second-order accurate scheme. ``\Delta_i`` is; the filter width in the ``x_i``-direction, and ``\Delta`` is given by the square root of the harmonic mean of the squares; of the filter widths in each direction; ```math; \frac{1}{\Delta^2} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta y^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta z^2} \right) \, .; ```; The term multiplying ``C_b`` is the buoyancy modification introduced by [Abkar17](@citet) and is small for weakly; stratified flows. We have introduced the ``C_b`` constant so that the buoyancy modification term may be turned on and off.;

Feel free to ask us questions and chat with us at any time about any topic at all; by:. * [Opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/new). * [Creating a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/discussions/new). * Sending a message to the [#oceananigans channel](https://julialang.slack.com/archives/C01D24C0CAH) on [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/). ## Creating issues. The simplest way to contribute to Oceananigans is to create or comment on issues and discussions. The most useful bug reports:. * Provide an explicit code snippet -- not just a link -- that reproduces the bug in the latest tagged version of Oceananigans. This is sometimes called the [""minimal working example""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example). Reducing bug-producing code to a minimal example can dramatically decrease the time it takes to resolve an issue. * Paste the _entire_ error received when running the code snippet, even if it's unbelievably long. * Use triple backticks (e.g., ````` ```some_code; and_some_more_code;``` `````) to enclose code snippets, and other [markdown formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to make your issue easy and quick to read. * Report the Oceananigans version, Julia version, machine (especially if using a GPU) and any other possibly useful details of the computational environment in which the bug was created. Discussions are recommended for asking questions about (for example) the user interface, implementation details, science, and life in general. ## But I want to _code_!. * New users help write Oceananigans code and documentation by [forking the Oceananigans repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/workin

For more information; see the [`CUDA.jl` documentation](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/). The ``y``-dimension is ""missing"" because it's marked `Flat` in `topology = (Periodic, Flat, Bounded)`.; So nothing varies in ``y``: `y`-derivatives are 0.; Also, the keyword argument (or ""kwarg"" for short) that specifies the ``y``-domains may be omitted, and `size` has only two elements rather than 3 as in the first example.; In the stretched cell interfaces specified by `z_interfaces`, the number of; vertical cell interfaces is `Nz + 1 = length(z_interfaces) = 5`, where `Nz = 4` is the number; of cells in the vertical. A bit later in this tutorial, we'll give examples that illustrate how to build a grid thats [`Distributed`](@ref) across _multiple_ CPUs and GPUs. ## Grid types: squares, shells, and mountains. The shape of the physical domain determines what grid type should be used:. 1. [`RectilinearGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.RectilinearGrid) can be fashioned into lines, rectangles and boxes.; 2. [`LatitudeLongitudeGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.LatitudeLongitudeGrid) represents sectors of thin spherical shells, with cells bounded by lines of constant latitude and longitude.; 3. [`OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid`](@ref Oceananigans.Grids.OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid) represents sectors of thin spherical shells divided with mesh lines that intersect at right angles (thus, orthogonal) but are otherwise arbitrary. !!! note ""OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids.jl""; See the auxiliary package [`OrthogonalSpherica

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: Field`s are defined by functions of ``(x, y, z, t)`` and optional parameters. A ; simple example is. ```jldoctest; using Oceananigans. U(x, y, z, t) = 0.2 * z. grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)). model = NonhydrostaticModel(grid = grid, background_fields = (u=U,)). model.background_fields.velocities.u. # output; FunctionField located at (Face, Center, Center); ├── func: U (generic function with 1 method); ├── grid: 1×1×1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 1×1×1 halo; ├── clock: Clock{Float64, Float64}(time=0 seconds, iteration=0, last_Δt=Inf days); └── parameters: nothing; ```. `BackgroundField`s are specified by passing them to the kwarg `background_fields`; in the `NonhydrostaticModel` constructor. The kwarg `background_fields` expects; a `NamedTuple` of fields, which are internally sorted into `velocities` and `tracers`,; wrapped in `FunctionField`s, and assigned their appropriate locations. `BackgroundField`s with parameters require using the `BackgroundField` wrapper:. ```jldoctest moar_background; using Oceananigans. parameters = (α=3.14, N=1.0, f=0.1). # Background fields are defined via function of x, y, z, t, and optional parameters; U(x, y, z, t, α) = α * z; B(x, y, z, t, p) = - p.α * p.f * y + p.N^2 * z . U_field = BackgroundField(U, parameters=parameters.α); B_field = BackgroundField(B, parameters=parameters). # output; BackgroundField{typeof(B), @NamedTuple{α::Float64, N::Float64, f::Float64}}; ├── func: B (generic function with 1 method); └── parameters: (α = 3.14, N = 1.0, f = 0.1); ```. When inserted into `NonhydrostaticModel`, we get. ```jldoctest moar_background; grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)). model = NonhydrostaticModel(grid = grid, background_fields = (u=U_field, b=B_field),; tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer()). model.background_fields.tracers.b. # output; FunctionField located at (Center, Center, Center); ├── func: B (generic function with 1 method); ├── grid: 1×1×

Integrability,"`M = 0``. Note that in deriving \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity},; we used the bottom boundary condition ``w_{\rm bottom} = \boldsymbol{u}_{\rm bottom} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla}_h H``. To form a linear system that can be solved implicitly we recast the vertically-integrated continuity; equation \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity} into a discrete integral form. The best way to do; so is by starting from the discrete version of the continuity equation (in this case without any surface; volume flux, ``M = 0``). ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:continuity-discrete}; \delta_x (A_x u) + \delta_y (A_y v) + \delta_z (A_z w) = 0 \, ,; \end{align}; ```. and summing it vertically to get:. ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete}; \delta_x \sum_k (A_x u) + \delta_y \sum_k (A_y v) + A_z \underbrace{w(k = N_z + 1)}_{w_{\rm top}} = 0 \, .; \end{align}; ```. In equations \eqref{eq:continuity-discrete} and \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete} and; here after, we have abused notation and used, e.g., ``u`` and ``v`` to denote the volume averages; over grid cells of the quantities ``u`` and ``v`` respectively.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: `M = 0``. Note that in deriving \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity},; we used the bottom boundary condition ``w_{\rm bottom} = \boldsymbol{u}_{\rm bottom} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla}_h H``. To form a linear system that can be solved implicitly we recast the vertically-integrated continuity; equation \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity} into a discrete integral form. The best way to do; so is by starting from the discrete version of the continuity equation (in this case without any surface; volume flux, ``M = 0``). ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:continuity-discrete}; \delta_x (A_x u) + \delta_y (A_y v) + \delta_z (A_z w) = 0 \, ,; \end{align}; ```. and summing it vertically to get:. ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete}; \delta_x \sum_k (A_x u) + \delta_y \sum_k (A_y v) + A_z \underbrace{w(k = N_z + 1)}_{w_{\rm top}} = 0 \, .; \end{align}; ```. In equations \eqref{eq:continuity-discrete} and \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete} and; here after, we have abused notation and used, e.g., ``u`` and ``v`` to denote the volume averages; over grid cells of the quantities ``u`` and ``v`` respectively. Using ``w_{\rm top} = \partial_t \eta`` and; being a bit more explicit on the locations the difference operators act on,; \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete} becomes:. ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:semi-discrete-integral-continuity}; A_z \partial_t \eta + \delta_{x}^{caa} \sum_{k} (A_x u) + \delta_y^{aca} \sum_k (A_y v) = 0 \, .; \end{equation}; ```.

The cubic domain is divided into a ""primary mesh"" of ``4 \times 5 \times 4 = 80`` cells,; which are evenly spaced in ``x, y`` but variably spaced in ``z``.; Now, in addition to the primary mesh, the grid defines also a set of ""staggered"" grids whose cells are; shifted by half a cell width relative to the primary mesh.; In other words, the staggered grid cells have a ""location"" in each direction -- either `Center`,; and therefore co-located with the primary mesh, or `Face` and located over the interfaces of the; primary mesh.; For example, the primary or `Center` cell spacings in ``z`` are. ```jldoctest fields; zspacings(grid, Center()). # output; 4-element view(OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 0:5), 1:4) with eltype Float64:; 0.1; 0.19999999999999998; 0.3; 0.4; ```. corresponding to cell interfaces located at `z = [0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1]`.; But then for the grid which is staggered in `z` relative to the primary mesh,. ```jldoctest fields; zspacings(grid, Face()). # output; 5-element view(OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, -1:5), 1:5) with eltype Float64:; 0.1; 0.15000000000000002; 0.24999999999999994; 0.3500000000000001; 0.3999999999999999; ```. The cells for the vertically staggered grid have different spacings than the primary mesh.; That's because the _edges_ of the vertically-staggered mesh coincide with the _nodes_ (the cell centers); of the primary mesh. The nodes of the primary mesh are. ```jldoctest fi

Plots made with `matplotlib` [@Hunter2007]; and `cmocean` [@Thyng2016]. ``Oceananigans.jl`` leverages the Julia programming language [@Bezanson2017] to; implement high-level, low-cost abstractions, a friendly user interface, and a; high-performance model in one language and a common code base for execution on; the CPU or GPU with Julia’s native GPU compiler [@Besard2019]. Because Julia is; a high-level language, development is streamlined and users can flexibly specify; model configurations, set up arbitrary diagnostics and output, extend the code; base, and implement new features. Configuring a model with `architecture=CPU()`; or `architecture=GPU()` will execute the model on the CPU or GPU. By pinning a; simulation script against a specific version of Oceananigans, simulation results; are reproducible up to hardware differences. Performance benchmarks show significant speedups when running on a GPU. Large; simulations on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU require ~1 nanosecond per grid point per; iteration. GPU simulations are therefore roughly 3x more cost-effective; than CPU simulations on cloud computing platforms such as Google Cloud. A GPU; with 32 GB of memory can time-step models with ~150 million grid points ass

The best way to do; so is by starting from the discrete version of the continuity equation (in this case without any surface; volume flux, ``M = 0``). ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:continuity-discrete}; \delta_x (A_x u) + \delta_y (A_y v) + \delta_z (A_z w) = 0 \, ,; \end{align}; ```. and summing it vertically to get:. ```math; \begin{align}; \label{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete}; \delta_x \sum_k (A_x u) + \delta_y \sum_k (A_y v) + A_z \underbrace{w(k = N_z + 1)}_{w_{\rm top}} = 0 \, .; \end{align}; ```. In equations \eqref{eq:continuity-discrete} and \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete} and; here after, we have abused notation and used, e.g., ``u`` and ``v`` to denote the volume averages; over grid cells of the quantities ``u`` and ``v`` respectively. Using ``w_{\rm top} = \partial_t \eta`` and; being a bit more explicit on the locations the difference operators act on,; \eqref{eq:vertically-integrated-continuity-discrete} becomes:. ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:semi-discrete-integral-continuity}; A_z \partial_t \eta + \delta_{x}^{caa} \sum_{k} (A_x u) + \delta_y^{aca} \sum_k (A_y v) = 0 \, .; \end{equation}; ```. We can now apply the velocity fractional step equation (discussed in the [Time-stepping section](@ref time_stepping)) for the [hydrostatic model](@ref hydrostatic_free_surface_model):. ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:hydrostatic-fractional-step}; \boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = \boldsymbol{u}^{\star} - g \Delta t \, \boldsymbol{\nabla} \eta^{n+1} \, .; \end{equation}; ```. We impose that the ``n+1``-th time step velocity is consistent with \eqref{eq:semi-discrete-integral-continuity}. ```math; \begin{equation}; A_z \frac{\eta^{n+1} - \eta^{n}}{\Delta t} = - \delta_x^{caa} \sum_k (A_x u^{n+1}) - \delta_y^{aca} \sum_k (A_y v^{n+1}) \, .; \end{equation}; ```. Substituting ``u^{n+1}`` and ``v^{n+1}`` from the disc

Using discrete forcing functions may require understanding the; staggered arrangement of velocity fields and tracers in `Oceananigans`.; Here's a slightly non-sensical example in which the vertical derivative of a buoyancy; tracer is used as a time-scale for damping the u-velocity field:. ```jldoctest discrete_forcing; # A damping term that depends on a ""local average"":; local_average(i, j, k, grid, c) = @inbounds (c[i, j, k] + c[i-1, j, k] + c[i+1, j, k] +; c[i, j-1, k] + c[i, j+1, k] +; c[i, j, k-1] + c[i, j, k+1]) / 7. b_forcing_func(i, j, k, grid, clock, model_fields) = - local_average(i, j, k, grid, model_fields.b). b_forcing = Forcing(b_forcing_func, discrete_form=true). # A term that damps the local velocity field in the presence of stratification; using Oceananigans.Operators: ∂zᶠᶜᶠ, ℑxzᶠᵃᶜ. function u_forcing_func(i, j, k, grid, clock, model_fields, ε); # The vertical derivative of buoyancy, interpolated to the u-velocity location:; N² = ℑxzᶠᵃᶜ(i, j, k, grid, ∂zᶠᶜᶠ, model_fields.b). # Set to zero in unstable stratification where N² < 0:; N² = max(N², zero(typeof(N²))). return @inbounds - ε * sqrt(N²) * model_fields.u[i, j, k]; end. u_forcing = Forcing(u_forcing_func, discrete_form=true, parameters=1e-3). grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)); model = NonhydrostaticModel(grid=grid, tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer(), forcing=(u=u_forcing, b=b_forcing)). mo

Integrability,"schemes that require more halo points than the default `3` in every direction.; Note that both `size` and `halo` are 2-`Tuple`s, rather than the 3-`Tuple` that would be required for a three-dimensional grid,; or the single number that would be used for a one-dimensional grid. ### The dimensions: `x, y, z` for `RectilinearGrid`, or `latitude, longitude, z` for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`. These keyword arguments specify the extent and location of the finite volume cells that divide up the; three dimensions of the grid.; For `RectilinearGrid`, the dimensions are called `x`, `y`, and `z`, whereas for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` the; dimensions are called `latitude`, `longitude`, and `z`.; The type of each keyword argument determines how the dimension is divided up:. * Tuples that specify only the end points indicate that the dimension should be divided into; equally-spaced cells. For example, `x = (0, 64)` with `size = (16, 8, 4)` means that the; `x`-dimension is divided into 16 cells, where the first or leftmost cell interface is located; at `x = 0` and the last or rightmost cell interface is located at `x = 64`.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: schemes that require more halo points than the default `3` in every direction.; Note that both `size` and `halo` are 2-`Tuple`s, rather than the 3-`Tuple` that would be required for a three-dimensional grid,; or the single number that would be used for a one-dimensional grid. ### The dimensions: `x, y, z` for `RectilinearGrid`, or `latitude, longitude, z` for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`. These keyword arguments specify the extent and location of the finite volume cells that divide up the; three dimensions of the grid.; For `RectilinearGrid`, the dimensions are called `x`, `y`, and `z`, whereas for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` the; dimensions are called `latitude`, `longitude`, and `z`.; The type of each keyword argument determines how the dimension is divided up:. * Tuples that specify only the end points indicate that the dimension should be divided into; equally-spaced cells. For example, `x = (0, 64)` with `size = (16, 8, 4)` means that the; `x`-dimension is divided into 16 cells, where the first or leftmost cell interface is located; at `x = 0` and the last or rightmost cell interface is located at `x = 64`. The width of each cell is `Δx=4.0`.; * Vectors and functions alternatively give the location of each cell interface, and thereby may be used; to build grids that are divided into cells of varying width. ## A complicated example: three-dimensional `RectilinearGrid` with variable spacing via functions. Next we build a grid that is both `Bounded` and stretched in both the `y` and `z` directions.; The purpose of the stretching is to increase grid resolution near the boundaries.; We'll do this by using functions to specify the keyword arguments `y` and `z`. ```jldoctest grids; Nx = Ny = 64; Nz = 32.

For this we use `ZFaceField`; with appropriate boundary conditions as our slip velocity:. ```jldoctest sinking; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions: ImpenetrableBoundaryCondition. grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(32, 32, 32), x=(-10, 10), y=(-10, 10), z=(-4, 4),; topology=(Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)). no_penetration = ImpenetrableBoundaryCondition(); slip_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(grid, (Center, Center, Face),; top=no_penetration, bottom=no_penetration). w_slip = ZFaceField(grid, boundary_conditions=slip_bcs); sinking = AdvectiveForcing(w=w_slip). # output; AdvectiveForcing:; ├── u: ZeroField{Int64}; ├── v: ZeroField{Int64}; └── w: 32×32×33 Field{Center, Center, Face} on RectilinearGrid on CPU; ```. To compute the slip velocity, we must add a `Callback`to `simulations.callback` that; computes `w_slip` ever iteration:. ```jldoctest sinking; using Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions: fill_halo_regions!. model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, tracers=(:b, :P), forcing=(; P=sinking)); simulation = Simulation(model; Δt=1, stop_iteration=100). # Build abstract operation for slip velocity; b_particle = - 1e-4 # relative buoyancy depends on reference density and initial buoyancy condition; b = model.tracers.b; R = 1e-3 # [m] mean particle radius; ν = 1.05e-6 # [m² s⁻¹] molecular kinematic viscosity of water; w_slip_op = 2/9 * (b - b_particle) / ν * R^2 # Stokes terminal velocity. function compute_slip_velocity!(sim); w_slip .= w_slip_op; fill_halo_regions!(w_slip); return nothing; end. simulation.callbacks[:slip] = Callback(compute_slip_velocity!). # output; Callback of compute_slip_velocity! on IterationInterval(1); ```;

This; helps the compiler optimize the code. Another way around this is to [define global variables as constants whenever; possible](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-global-variables). One; thing to keep in mind when doing this is that when a `const` is defined, its value can't be changed; until you restart the Julia session. So this latter approach is good for production-ready code, but; may be undesirable in the early stages of development while you still have to change the parameters; of the simulation for exploration. It is especially important to avoid global variables in functions that are meant to be executed in; GPU kernels (such as functions defining boundary conditions and forcings). Otherwise the Julia GPU; compiler can fail with obscure errors. This is explained in more detail in the GPU simulation tips; section below. ### Consider inlining small functions.

Keyword; arguments `x`, `y`, and `z` could be either *(i)* 2-`Tuple`s that define the the _end points_ in; each direction, or *(ii)* arrays or functions of the corresponding indices `i`, `j`, or `k` that; specify the locations of cell faces in the `x`-, `y`-, or `z`-direction, respectively.

Content: NO advection scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WENO_methods).; It's quite similar to the [two-dimensional turbulence example](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/generated/two_dimensional_turbulence/). ## Visualization. They say that a [Makie](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/) visualization is worth a thousand Unicode characters, so let's plot vorticity,. ```@example cpu; using CairoMakie. u, v, w = model.velocities; ζ = Field(∂x(v) - ∂y(u)); compute!(ζ). heatmap(ζ, axis=(; aspect=1)); ```. A few more time-steps, and it's starting to get a little diffuse!. ```@example cpu; simulation.stop_iteration += 400; run!(simulation). compute!(ζ); heatmap(ζ, axis=(; aspect=1)); ```. ## They always cheat with too-simple ""quick"" starts. Fine, we'll re-run this code on the GPU. But we're a little greedy, so we'll also; crank up the resolution, throw in a `TimeStepWizard` to update `simulation.Δt` adaptively,; and add a passive tracer initially concentrated in the center of the domain; which will make for an even prettier figure of the final state:. ```@setup gpu; using CairoMakie; CairoMakie.activate!(type = ""png""); ```. ```@example gpu; using Oceananigans; using CairoMakie. grid = RectilinearGrid(GPU(),; size = (1024, 1024),; x = (-π, π),; y = (-π, π),; topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Flat)). model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, advection=WENO(), tracers=:c). δ = 0.5; cᵢ(x, y) = exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / 2δ^2); ϵ(x, y) = 2rand() - 1; set!(model, u=ϵ, v=ϵ, c=cᵢ). simulation = Simulation(model; Δt=1e-3, stop_time=10); conjure_time_step_wizard!(simulation, cfl=0.2, IterationInterval(10)); run!(simulation). u, v, w = model.velocities; ζ = Field(∂x(v) - ∂y(u)); compute!(ζ). fig = Figure(size=(1200, 600)); axζ = Axis(fig[1, 1], aspect=1, title=""vorticity""); axc = Axis(fig[1, 2], aspect=1, title=""tracer""); heatmap!(axζ, ζ, colormap=:balance); heatmap!(axc, model.tracers.c); current_figure(); ```. See how we did that? We passed the positional argument `GPU()` to `Re

Additionally, two ``\delta`` operators must be defined for each direction to account for the ; staggered nature of the grid. One for taking the difference of a cell-centered variable and ; projecting it onto the cell faces; ```math; \begin{align}; \delta_x^{faa} f_{i, j, k} &= f_{i, j, k} - f_{i-1, j, k} \, , \\; \delta_y^{afa} f_{i, j, k} &= f_{i, j, k} - f_{i, j-1, k} \, , \\; \delta_z^{aaf} f_{i, j, k} &= f_{i, j, k} - f_{i, j, k-1} \, , ; \end{align}; ```; and another for taking the difference of a face-centered variable and projecting it onto the; cell centers; ```math; \begin{align}; \delta_x^{caa} f_{i, j, k} &= f_{i+1, j, k} - f_{i, j, k} \, , \\; \delta_y^{aca} f_{i, j, k} &= f_{i, j+1, k} - f_{i, j, k} \, , \\; \delta_z^{aac} f_{i, j, k} &= f_{i, j, k+1} - f_{i, j, k} \, .; \end{align}; ```. ## Interpolation. In order to add or multiply variables that are defined at different points they are interpolated. ; In our case, linear interpolation or averaging is employed.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: total; `indices` spanned by the grid. ## Staggered grids and field locations. Oceananigans ocean-flavored fluids simulations rely fundamentally on; ""staggered grid"" numerical methods. Recall that [grids](@ref grids_tutorial) represent a physical domain divided into finite volumes.; For example, let's consider a horizontally-periodic, vertically-bounded grid of cells; that divide up a cube with dimensions ``1 \times 1 \times 1``:. ```jldoctest fields; using Oceananigans. grid = RectilinearGrid(topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded),; size = (4, 5, 4),; halo = (1, 1, 1),; x = (0, 1),; y = (0, 1),; z = [0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1]). # output; 4×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 1×1×1 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 1.0) regularly spaced with Δx=0.25; ├── Periodic y ∈ [0.0, 1.0) regularly spaced with Δy=0.2; └── Bounded z ∈ [0.0, 1.0] variably spaced with min(Δz)=0.1, max(Δz)=0.4; ```. The cubic domain is divided into a ""primary mesh"" of ``4 \times 5 \times 4 = 80`` cells,; which are evenly spaced in ``x, y`` but variably spaced in ``z``.; Now, in addition to the primary mesh, the grid defines also a set of ""staggered"" grids whose cells are; shifted by half a cell width relative to the primary mesh.; In other words, the staggered grid cells have a ""location"" in each direction -- either `Center`,; and therefore co-located with the primary mesh, or `Face` and located over the interfaces of the; primary mesh.; For example, the primary or `Center` cell spacings in ``z`` are. ```jldoctest fields; zspacings(grid, Center()). # output; 4-element view(OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 0:5), 1:4) with eltype Float64:; 0.1; 0.19999999999999998; 0.3; 0.4; ```. corresponding to cell interfaces located at `z = [0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1]`.; But then for the grid which is staggered in `z` relative to the primary mesh,. ```jldoctest fields; zspacings(grid, Face()). # output; 5-element view(OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, -1:5), 1:5) with eltype Float64:; 0.1; 0.150000

We then project ``\boldsymbol{v}^\star`` ; onto the space of divergence-free velocity fields to obtain a value for ``\boldsymbol{v}^{n+1}`` ; that satisfies continuity. For example, for the `NonhydrostaticModel`, if we ignore the background velocity fields and the; surface waves, we thus discretize the momentum equation as; ```math; \frac{\boldsymbol{v}^\star - \boldsymbol{v}^n}{\Delta t}; = - \left[ \boldsymbol{v} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{v} \right]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}; - \boldsymbol{f} \times \boldsymbol{v}^{n+\frac{1}{2}}; + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \left ( \nu \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{v}^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \right ); + \boldsymbol{F}_{\boldsymbol{v}}^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \, ,; ```; where the superscript ``n + \frac{1}{2}`` indicates that these terms are evaluated at time step ; ``n + \frac{1}{2}``, which we compute explicitly (see [Time-stepping section](@ref time_stepping)). The projection is then performed; ```math; \boldsymbol{v}^{n+1} = \boldsymbol{v}^\star - \Delta t \, \boldsymbol{\nabla} p^{n+1} \, ,; ```; to obtain a divergence-free velocity field ``\boldsymbol{v}^{n+1}``. Here the projection is performed by solving an elliptic; problem for the pressure ``p^{n+1}`` with the boundary condition; ```math; \boldsymbol{\hat{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} p^{n+1} |_{\partial\Omega} = 0 \, .; ```. [Orszag86](@citet) and [Brown01](@citet) raise an important issue regarding these fractional step ; methods, which is that ""*while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy ; in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the ``L_\infty``-norm.*"" ; The numerical boundary conditions must be carefully accounted for to ensure the second-order ; accuracy promised by the fractional step methods.; ",perform,MatchSource.DOCS,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/appendix/fractional_step.md:1462,performed,1462,docs/src/appendix/fractional_step.md,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/appendix/fractional_step.md,2,['perform'],['performed'],"The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content:  an approximation to ; the discretized momentum equation for an intermediate velocity field ``\boldsymbol{v}^\star`` ; without worrying about satisfying the incompressibility constraint. We then project ``\boldsymbol{v}^\star`` ; onto the space of divergence-free velocity fields to obtain a value for ``\boldsymbol{v}^{n+1}`` ; that satisfies continuity. For example, for the `NonhydrostaticModel`, if we ignore the background velocity fields and the; surface waves, we thus discretize the momentum equation as; ```math; \frac{\boldsymbol{v}^\star - \boldsymbol{v}^n}{\Delta t}; = - \left[ \boldsymbol{v} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{v} \right]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}; - \boldsymbol{f} \times \boldsymbol{v}^{n+\frac{1}{2}}; + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \left ( \nu \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{v}^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \right ); + \boldsymbol{F}_{\boldsymbol{v}}^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \, ,; ```; where the superscript ``n + \frac{1}{2}`` indicates that these terms are evaluated at time step ; ``n + \frac{1}{2}``, which we compute explicitly (see [Time-stepping section](@ref time_stepping)). The projection is then performed; ```math; \boldsymbol{v}^{n+1} = \boldsymbol{v}^\star - \Delta t \, \boldsymbol{\nabla} p^{n+1} \, ,; ```; to obtain a divergence-free velocity field ``\boldsymbol{v}^{n+1}``. Here the projection is performed by solving an elliptic; problem for the pressure ``p^{n+1}`` with the boundary condition; ```math; \boldsymbol{\hat{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} p^{n+1} |_{\partial\Omega} = 0 \, .; ```. [Orszag86](@citet) and [Brown01](@citet) raise an important issue regarding these fractional step ; methods, which is that ""*while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy ; in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the ``L_\infty``-norm.*"" ; The numerical boundary conditions must be carefully accounted for to ensure the second-order ; accuracy promised by the fractional step methods.;

Another way around this is to [define global variables as constants whenever; possible](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-global-variables). One; thing to keep in mind when doing this is that when a `const` is defined, its value can't be changed; until you restart the Julia session. So this latter approach is good for production-ready code, but; may be undesirable in the early stages of development while you still have to change the parameters; of the simulation for exploration. It is especially important to avoid global variables in functions that are meant to be executed in; GPU kernels (such as functions defining boundary conditions and forcings).

Content: # Spatial operators. To calculate the various terms and perform the time-stepping, discrete difference and interpolation ; operators must be designed from which all the terms, such as momentum advection and Laplacian ; diffusion, may be constructed. Much of the material in this section is derived from [Marshall97FV](@citet). ## Differences. Difference operators act as the discrete form of the derivative operator. Care must be taken ; when calculating differences on a staggered grid. For example, the the difference of a cell-centered ; variable such as temperature ``T`` lies on the faces in the direction of the difference, and ; vice versa. In principle, there are three difference operators, one for each direction; ```math; \delta_x f = f_E - f_W , \quad; \delta_y f = f_N - f_S , \quad; \delta_z f = f_T - f_B ,; ```; where the ``E`` and ``W`` subscripts indicate that the value is evaluated the eastern or western ; wall of the cell, ``N`` and ``S`` indicate the northern and southern walls, and ``T`` and ``B`` ; indicate the top and bottom walls.

Similar to to shallow water model, the nonhydrostatic model benchmark tests for its performance on both a CPU and a GPU. It was also benchmarked with the `WENO` advection scheme. The nonhydrostatic model is 3-dimensional unlike the 2-dimensional shallow water model. Total number of grid points is Ns cubed. ```; Oceananigans v0.58.8; Julia Version 1.6.1; Commit 6aaedecc44 (2021-04-23 05:59 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu); CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4216 CPU @ 2.10GHz; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-11.0.1 (ORCJIT, cascadelake); Environment:; EBVERSIONJULIA = 1.6.1; JULIA_DEPOT_PATH = :; EBROOTJULIA = /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/Core/julia/1.6.1; EBDEVELJULIA = /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/Core/julia/1.6.1/easybuild/avx2-Core-julia-1.6.1-easybuild-devel; JULIA_LOAD_PATH = :; GPU: Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB.

Discrete-form boundary condition with parameters. ```jldoctest; julia> Cd = 0.2; # drag coefficient. julia> @inline linear_drag(i, j, grid, clock, model_fields, Cd) = @inbounds - Cd * model_fields.u[i, j, 1];. julia> u_bottom_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(linear_drag, discrete_form=true, parameters=Cd); FluxBoundaryCondition: DiscreteBoundaryFunction linear_drag with parameters 0.2; ```. !!! info ""Inlining and avoiding bounds-checking in boundary condition functions""; Boundary condition functions should be decorated with `@inline` when running on CPUs for performance reasons.; On the GPU, all functions are force-inlined by default.; In addition, the annotation `@inbounds` should be used when accessing the elements of an array; in a boundary condition function (such as `model_fields.u[i, j, 1]` in the above example).; Using `@inbounds` will avoid a relatively expensive check that the index `i, j, 1` is 'in bounds'. ### 9. A random, spatially-varying, constant-in-time temperature flux specified by an array. ```jldoctest; julia> Nx = Ny = 16; # Number of grid points. julia> Q = randn(Nx, Ny); # temperature flux. julia> white_noise_T_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(Q); FluxBoundaryCondition: 16×16 Matrix{Float64}; ```. When running on the GPU, `Q` must be converted to a `CuArray`. ## Building boundary conditions on a field. To create a set of [`FieldBoundaryConditions`](@ref) for a temperature field,; we write. ```jldoctest; julia> T_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(top = V

Testability,"ic version of Oceananigans, simulation results; are reproducible up to hardware differences. Performance benchmarks show significant speedups when running on a GPU. Large; simulations on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU require ~1 nanosecond per grid point per; iteration. GPU simulations are therefore roughly 3x more cost-effective; than CPU simulations on cloud computing platforms such as Google Cloud. A GPU; with 32 GB of memory can time-step models with ~150 million grid points assuming; five fields are being evolved; for example, three velocity components and; tracers for temperature and salinity. These performance gains permit the; long-time integration of realistic simulations, such as large eddy simulation of; oceanic boundary layer turbulence over a seasonal cycle or the generation of; training data for turbulence parameterizations in Earth system models. ``Oceananigans.jl`` is continuously tested on CPUs and GPUs with unit tests,; integration tests, analytic solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes; equations, convergence tests, and verification experiments against published; scientific results. Future development plans include support for distributed; parallelism with CUDA-aware MPI as well as topography.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: ic version of Oceananigans, simulation results; are reproducible up to hardware differences. Performance benchmarks show significant speedups when running on a GPU. Large; simulations on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU require ~1 nanosecond per grid point per; iteration. GPU simulations are therefore roughly 3x more cost-effective; than CPU simulations on cloud computing platforms such as Google Cloud. A GPU; with 32 GB of memory can time-step models with ~150 million grid points assuming; five fields are being evolved; for example, three velocity components and; tracers for temperature and salinity. These performance gains permit the; long-time integration of realistic simulations, such as large eddy simulation of; oceanic boundary layer turbulence over a seasonal cycle or the generation of; training data for turbulence parameterizations in Earth system models. ``Oceananigans.jl`` is continuously tested on CPUs and GPUs with unit tests,; integration tests, analytic solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes; equations, convergence tests, and verification experiments against published; scientific results. Future development plans include support for distributed; parallelism with CUDA-aware MPI as well as topography.

This will install all the dependencies in the Project.toml; file. Your development environment is now ready!. * You can test to make sure Oceananigans works by typing in `] test`. (This is equivalent to; `using Pkg; Pkg.test()`.) Doing so will run all the tests (and this can take a while).; Alternatively, you can run only one test script file by providing its name as an environment; variable. For example, to run the tests only from the `test_coriolis.jl` file we call:. ```; $ TEST_FILE=test_coriolis.jl julia --project -e""using Pkg; Pkg.test()""; ```. ## Pull Requests.

With; \eqref{eq:box-kernel} we get back the averaging operator originally used by [Deardorff70](@citet); ```math; \overline{\boldsymbol{v}(x, y, z, t)} =; \frac{1}{\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z}; \int_{x - \frac{1}{2}\Delta x}^{x + \frac{1}{2}\Delta x}; \int_{y - \frac{1}{2}\Delta y}^{y + \frac{1}{2}\Delta y}; \int_{z - \frac{1}{2}\Delta z}^{z + \frac{1}{2}\Delta z}; \boldsymbol{v}(\xi, \eta, \zeta, t) \, \mathrm{d} \xi \, \mathrm{d} \eta \, \mathrm{d} \zeta \, ,; ```; which if evaluated at the cell centers just returns the cell averages we already compute in the finite volume method. ## Smagorinsky-Lilly model. [Smagorinsky63](@citet) estimated the eddy viscosity ``\nu_e`` via a characteristic length scale ``\Delta`` times a velocity; scale given by ``\Delta |\overline{S}|`` where ``|\overline{S}| = \sqrt{2\o

Usability,"calling; the function. The Julia compiler automatically makes some calls as to what functions it should or; shouldn't inline, but you can force a function to be inlined by including the macro `@inline` before; its definition. This is more suited for small functions that are called often. Here's an example of; an implementation of the Heaviside function that forces it to be inlined:. ```julia; @inline heaviside(x) = ifelse(x < 0, zero(x), one(x)); ```. In practice it's hard to say whether inlining a function will bring runtime benefits _with; certainty_, since Julia and KernelAbstractions.jl (needed for GPU runs) already inline some; functions automatically. However, it is generally a good idea to at least investigate this aspect in; your code as the benefits can potentially be significant. ## GPU simulation tips. Running on GPUs can be very different from running on CPUs. Oceananigans makes most of the necessary; changes in the background, so that for very simple simulations changing between CPUs and GPUs is; just a matter of changing the `architecture` argument in the model from `CPU()` to `GPU()`. However,; for more complex simulations some care needs to be taken on the part of the user. While knowledge of; GPU computing (and Julia) is again desirable, an inexperienced user can also achieve high efficiency; in GPU simulations by following a few simple principles. ### Global variables that need to be used in GPU computations need to be defined as constants or passed as parameters. Any global variable that needs to be accessed by the GPU needs to be a constant or the simulation; will crash. This includes any variables that are referenced as global variables in functions; used for forcing of boundary conditions. For example,. ```julia; T₀ = 20 # ᵒC; surface_temperature(x, y, t) = T₀ * sin(2π / 86400 * t); T_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(bottom = GradientBoundaryCondition(surface_temperature)); ```. will throw an error if run on the GPU (and will run more slowly than ",simpl,MatchSource.DOCS,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/simulation_tips.md:3586,simple,3586,docs/src/simulation_tips.md,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/simulation_tips.md,1,['simpl'],['simple'],"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

In practice it's hard to say whether inlining a function will bring runtime benefits _with; certainty_, since Julia and KernelAbstractions.jl (needed for GPU runs) already inline some; functions automatically. However, it is generally a good idea to at least investigate this aspect in; your code as the benefits can potentially be significant. ## GPU simulation tips. Running on GPUs can be very different from running on CPUs. Oceananigans makes most of the necessary; changes in the background, so that for very simple simulations changing between CPUs and GPUs is; just a matter of changing the `architecture` argument in the model from `CPU()` to `GPU()`. However,; for more complex simulations some care needs to be taken on the part of the user. While knowledge of; GPU computing (and Julia) is again desirable, an inexperienced user can also achieve high efficiency; in GPU simulations by following a few simple principles. ### Global variables that need to be used in GPU computations need to be defined as constants or passed as parameters. Any global variable that needs to be accessed by the GPU needs to be a constant or the simulation; will crash. This includes any variables that are referenced as global variables in functions; used for forcing of boundary conditions. For example,. ```julia; T₀ = 20 # ᵒC; surface_temperature(x, y, t) = T₀ * sin(2π / 86400 * t); T_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(bottom = GradientBoundaryCondition(surface_temperature)); ```. will throw an error if run on the GPU (and will run more slowly than

Content: ecrease the time it takes to resolve an issue. * Paste the _entire_ error received when running the code snippet, even if it's unbelievably long. * Use triple backticks (e.g., ````` ```some_code; and_some_more_code;``` `````) to enclose code snippets, and other [markdown formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to make your issue easy and quick to read. * Report the Oceananigans version, Julia version, machine (especially if using a GPU) and any other possibly useful details of the computational environment in which the bug was created. Discussions are recommended for asking questions about (for example) the user interface, implementation details, science, and life in general. ## But I want to _code_!. * New users help write Oceananigans code and documentation by [forking the Oceananigans repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks), [using git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to edit code and docs, and then creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Pull requests are reviewed by Oceananigans collaborators. * A pull request can be merged once it is reviewed and approved by collaborators. If the pull request author has write access, they have the responsibility of merging their pull request. Otherwise, Oceananigans.jl collaborators will execute the merge with permission from the pull request author. * Note: for small or minor changes (such as fixing a typo in documentation), the [GitHub editor](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github/editing-files-in-your-repository) is super useful for forking and opening a pull request with a single click. * Write your code with love and care.

Have a look at an; [example for how to create scratch space](https://github.com/CliMA/LESbrary.jl/blob/cf31b0ec20219d5ad698af334811d448c27213b0/examples/three_layer_ constant_fluxes.jl#L380-L383) and how it can be; [used in calculations](https://github.com/CliMA/LESbrary.jl/blob/cf31b0ec20219d5ad698af334811d448c27213b0/src/TurbulenceStatistics/first_through_third_order.jl#L109-L112). ### Arrays in GPUs are usually different from arrays in CPUs. Oceananigans.jl uses [`CUDA.CuArray`](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/usage/array/) to store ; data for GPU computations. One limitation of `CuArray`s compared to the `Array`s used for ; CPU computations is that `CuArray` elements in general cannot be accessed outside kernels; launched through CUDA.jl or KernelAbstractions.jl. (You can learn more about GPU kernels ; [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#kernels) and ; [here](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/usage/overview/#Kernel-programming-with-@cuda).); Doing so requires individual elements to be copied from or to the GPU for processing,; which is very slow and can result in huge slowdowns. To avoid such unintentional slowdowns,; Oceananigans.jl disables CUDA scalar indexing by default. See the; [scalar indexing](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/dev/usage/workflow/#UsageWorkflowScalar); section of the CUDA.jl documentation for more information on scalar indexing. For example, if can be difficult to just view a `CuArray` since Julia needs to access ; its elements to do that. Consider the example below:. ```julia; julia> using Oceananigans, Adapt. julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(GPU(); size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1), halo=(1, 1, 1)); 1×1×1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 1×1×1 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 1.0) regular",learn,MatchSource.DOCS,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/simulation_tips.md:10755,learn,10755,docs/src/simulation_tips.md,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/simulation_tips.md,1,['learn'],['learn'],"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

Have a look at an; [example for how to create scratch space](https://github.com/CliMA/LESbrary.jl/blob/cf31b0ec20219d5ad698af334811d448c27213b0/examples/three_layer_ constant_fluxes.jl#L380-L383) and how it can be; [used in calculations](https://github.com/CliMA/LESbrary.jl/blob/cf31b0ec20219d5ad698af334811d448c27213b0/src/TurbulenceStatistics/first_through_third_order.jl#L109-L112). ### Arrays in GPUs are usually different from arrays in CPUs. Oceananigans.jl uses [`CUDA.CuArray`](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/usage/array/) to store ; data for GPU computations. One limitation of `CuArray`s compared to the `Array`s used for ; CPU computations is that `CuArray` elements in general cannot be accessed outside kernels; launched through CUDA.jl or KernelAbstractions.jl. (You can learn more about GPU kernels ; [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#kernels) and ; [here](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/usage/overview/#Kernel-programming-with-@cuda).); Doing so requires individual elements to be copied from or to the GPU for processing,; which is very slow and can result in huge slowdowns. To avoid such unintentional slowdowns,; Oceananigans.jl disables CUDA scalar indexing by default. See the; [scalar indexing](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/dev/usage/workflow/#UsageWorkflowScalar); section of the CUDA.jl documentation for more information on scalar indexing. For example, if can be difficult to just view a `CuArray` since Julia needs to access ; its elements to do that. Consider the example below:. ```julia; julia> using Oceananigans, Adapt. julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(GPU(); size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1), halo=(1, 1, 1)); 1×1×1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 1×1×1 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [0.0, 1.0) regular
