Content: ts compiling and linking in a single step:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --offload-arch=gfx906 -xhip sample.cpp -o sample. In the above commands, ``gfx906`` is the GPU architecture that the code is being compiled for. The supported GPU; architectures can be found in the `AMDGPU Processor Table <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors>`_.; Alternatively, you can use the ``amdgpu-arch`` tool that comes with Clang to list the GPU architecture on your system:. .. code-block:: shell. amdgpu-arch. You can use ``--offload-arch=native`` to automatically detect the GPU architectures on your system:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --offload-arch=native -xhip sample.cpp -o sample. Path Setting for Dependencies; =============================. Compiling a HIP program depends on the HIP runtime and device library.

Deployability,"urned value; is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in; case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed; step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance; is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for; particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than; 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here. After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to; the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by; TGeoManager::FindNextDaughterBoundary(). This computes the; distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by; using volume voxelization. The algorithm is efficient in average only in; case the number of daughters is greater than 4. For fewer nodes, a; simple loop is performed and the minimum distance (from a point outside; each shape) is taken and compared to the maximum allowed step. The step; value is again updated if `step<stepmax` . A special case is when the current node is declared as possibly; overlapping with something else. If this is the case, the distance is; computed for all possibly overlapping candidates, taking into account; the overlapping priorities (see also: "" Overlapping volumes "").

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: urned value; is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in; case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed; step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance; is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for; particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than; 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here. After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to; the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by; TGeoManager::FindNextDaughterBoundary(). This computes the; distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by; using volume voxelization. The algorithm is efficient in average only in; case the number of daughters is greater than 4. For fewer nodes, a; simple loop is performed and the minimum distance (from a point outside; each shape) is taken and compared to the maximum allowed step. The step; value is again updated if `step<stepmax` . A special case is when the current node is declared as possibly; overlapping with something else. If this is the case, the distance is; computed for all possibly overlapping candidates, taking into account; the overlapping priorities (see also: "" Overlapping volumes ""). The global matrix describing the next crossed physical node is; systematically computed in case the value of the proposed step is; negative. In this case, one can subsequently call; TGeoManager::ComputeNormalFast() to get the normal vector to the; crossed surface, after propagating the current point with the; TGeoManager::GetStep() value. This propagation can be done like:. ~~~{.cpp}; Double_t *current_point = gGeoManager->GetCurrentPoint();; Double_t *current_dir = gGeoManager->GetCurrentDirection();; for (Int_t i=0; i<3; i++); current_point[i] += step * current_dir[I];; ~~~. Note: The method TGeoManager::FindNextBoundary() does not modify the; current point/direction nor the current volume/s

The :program:`lit` output for a test run conforms to the following schema, in; both short and verbose modes (although in short mode no PASS lines will be; shown). This schema has been chosen to be relatively easy to reliably parse by; a machine (for example in buildbot log scraping), and for other tools to; generate. Each test result is expected to appear on a line that matches:. .. code-block:: none. <result code>: <test name> (<progress info>). where ``<result-code>`` is a standard test result such as PASS, FAIL, XFAIL,; XPASS, UNRESOLVED, or UNSUPPORTED.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: ut of scope on the C++ side, the Python object will change type; into an object that largely behaves like None. The strict policy differs in that it will never relinquish ownership; when passing an object as a parameter to a function. It is then up to; the developer to prevent double deletes. Choosing one or the other; policy is done by:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryStrict ); ```. for the strict policy, or for the heuristic policy:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryHeuristics ); ```. Care must be taken in the case of graphic objects: when drawn on the; current pad, a reference to the graphics is kept that `PyROOT` isn't; currently aware of, and it is up to the developer to keep at lease one; Python reference alive. See `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/pyroot/zdemo.py`; (available in the latest release) for an example. Alternatively, one can; tell python to give up ownership for individual instances:. ``` {.cpp}; o = ROOT.TObject(); ROOT.SetOwnership( o, False ) # True to own, False to release; ```. #### Memory Management by Hand.

To be translated to or from a YAML mapping for your type T you must specialize; llvm::yaml::MappingTraits on T and implement the ""void mapping(IO &io, T&)""; method.

There are five :arc-term:`managed operations` which may be performed on an; object of retainable object pointer type. Each qualifier specifies different; semantics for each of these operations. It is still undefined behavior to; access an object outside of its lifetime. A load or store with ""primitive semantics"" has the same semantics as the; respective operation would have on an ``void*`` lvalue with the same alignment; and non-ownership qualification. :arc-term:`Reading` occurs when performing a lvalue-to-rvalue conversion on an; object lvalue. * For ``__weak`` objects, the current pointee is retained and then released at; the end of the current full-expression. In particular, messaging a ``__weak``; object keeps the object retained until the end of the full expression. .. code-block:: objc. __weak MyObject *weakObj;. void foo() {; // weakObj is retained before the message send and released at the end of; // the full expression.; [weakObj m];; }. This must execute atomically with respect to assignments and to the final; release of the pointee.; * For all other objects, the lvalue is loaded with primitive semantics. :arc-term:`Assignment` occurs when evaluating an assignment operator. The; semantics vary based on the qualification:. * For ``__strong`` objects, the new pointee is first retained; second, the; lvalue is loaded with primitive semantics; third, the new pointee is stored; into the lvalue with primitive semantics; and finally, the old pointee is; released. This is not performed atomically; external synchronization must be; used to make this safe in the face of concurrent loads and stores.; * For ``__weak`` objects, the lvalue is updated to point to the new pointee,; unless the new pointee is an object currently undergoing deallocation, in; which case the lvalue is updated to a null pointer. This must execute; atomically with respect to other ass
