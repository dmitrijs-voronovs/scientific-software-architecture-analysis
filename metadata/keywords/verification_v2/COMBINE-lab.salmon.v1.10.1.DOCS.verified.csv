Availability,"-aware* transcriptome file. . There are two options for generating a decoy-aware transcriptome:. - The first is to compute a set of decoy sequences by mapping the annotated transcripts you wish to index; against a hard-masked version of the organism's genome. This can be done with e.g. ; `MashMap2 <https://github.com/marbl/MashMap>`_, and we provide some simple scripts to ; greatly simplify this whole process. Specifically, you can use the ; `generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh>`_; script, whose instructions you can find `in this README <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/README.md>`_. . - The second is to use the entire genome of the organism as the decoy sequence. This can be ; done by concatenating the genome to the end of the transcriptome you want to index and populating ; the `decoys.txt` file with the chromosome names. Detailed instructions on how to prepare this ; type of decoy sequence is available `here <https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/>`_.; This scheme provides a more comprehensive set of decoys, but, obviously, requires considerably more memory to build the index. Finally, pre-built versions of both the *partial* decoy and *full* decoy (i.e. using the whole genome) salmon indices ; for some common organisms are available via refgenie `here <http://refgenomes.databio.org/>`_. If you are not using a pre-computed index, you run the salmon indexer as so:. ::; ; > ./bin/salmon index -t transcripts.fa -i transcripts_index --decoys decoys.txt -k 31; ; This will build the mapping-based index, using an auxiliary k-mer hash; over k-mers of length 31. While the mapping algorithms will make used of arbitrarily ; long matches between the query and reference, the `k` size selected here will ; act as the *minimum* acceptable length for a valid match. Thus, a smaller ; value of `k` may slightly improve sensitivity.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: -aware* transcriptome file. . There are two options for generating a decoy-aware transcriptome:. - The first is to compute a set of decoy sequences by mapping the annotated transcripts you wish to index; against a hard-masked version of the organism's genome. This can be done with e.g. ; `MashMap2 <https://github.com/marbl/MashMap>`_, and we provide some simple scripts to ; greatly simplify this whole process. Specifically, you can use the ; `generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh>`_; script, whose instructions you can find `in this README <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/README.md>`_. . - The second is to use the entire genome of the organism as the decoy sequence. This can be ; done by concatenating the genome to the end of the transcriptome you want to index and populating ; the `decoys.txt` file with the chromosome names. Detailed instructions on how to prepare this ; type of decoy sequence is available `here <https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/>`_.; This scheme provides a more comprehensive set of decoys, but, obviously, requires considerably more memory to build the index. Finally, pre-built versions of both the *partial* decoy and *full* decoy (i.e. using the whole genome) salmon indices ; for some common organisms are available via refgenie `here <http://refgenomes.databio.org/>`_. If you are not using a pre-computed index, you run the salmon indexer as so:. ::; ; > ./bin/salmon index -t transcripts.fa -i transcripts_index --decoys decoys.txt -k 31; ; This will build the mapping-based index, using an auxiliary k-mer hash; over k-mers of length 31. While the mapping algorithms will make used of arbitrarily ; long matches between the query and reference, the `k` size selected here will ; act as the *minimum* acceptable length for a valid match. Thus, a smaller ; value of `k` may slightly improve sensitivity. We find tha

However, preliminary; testing suggests that the sparsity-inducing effect of running the VBEM with a small; prior may lead, in general, to more accurate estimates (the current testing was; performed mostly through simulation).

Salmon has the ability to optionally compute bootstrapped abundance estimates.; This is done by resampling (with replacement) from the counts assigned to; the fragment equivalence classes, and then re-running the optimization procedure,; either the EM or VBEM, for each such sample. The values of these different; bootstraps allows us to assess technical variance in the main abundance estimates; we produce. Such estimates can be useful for downstream (e.g. differential; expression) tools that can make use of such uncertainty estimates. This option; takes a positive integer that dictates the number of bootstrap samples to compute.; The more samples computed, the better the estimates of variance, but the; more computation (and time) required. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; ``--numGibbsSamples``; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Just as with the bootstrap procedure above, this option produces samples that allow; us to estimate the variance in abundance estimates. However, in this case the; samples are generated using posterior Gibbs sampling over the fragment equivalence; classes rather than bootstrapping.

Content: d VBEM algorithms. As mentioned above, a thorough comparison of all of the benefits and detriments; of the different algorithms is an ongoing area of research. However, preliminary; testing suggests that the sparsity-inducing effect of running the VBEM with a small; prior may lead, in general, to more accurate estimates (the current testing was; performed mostly through simulation). Hence, the VBEM is the default, and the; standard EM algorithm is accessed via the `--useEM` flag. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; ``--numBootstraps``; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Salmon has the ability to optionally compute bootstrapped abundance estimates.; This is done by resampling (with replacement) from the counts assigned to; the fragment equivalence classes, and then re-running the optimization procedure,; either the EM or VBEM, for each such sample. The values of these different; bootstraps allows us to assess technical variance in the main abundance estimates; we produce. Such estimates can be useful for downstream (e.g. differential; expression) tools that can make use of such uncertainty estimates. This option; takes a positive integer that dictates the number of bootstrap samples to compute.; The more samples computed, the better the estimates of variance, but the; more computation (and time) required. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; ``--numGibbsSamples``; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Just as with the bootstrap procedure above, this option produces samples that allow; us to estimate the variance in abundance estimates.

We are currently analyzing these different approaches; to assess the potential trade-offs in time / accuracy.

Content: ear in the following order:. +------+--------+-----------------+----+----------+; | Name | Length | EffectiveLength |TPM | NumReads |; +------+--------+-----------------+----+----------+. Each subsequent row describes a single quantification record. The columns have; the following interpretation. * **Name** --- ; This is the name of the target transcript provided in the input transcript database (FASTA file). . * **Length** ---; This is the length of the target transcript in nucleotides. * **EffectiveLength** ---; This is the computed *effective* length of the target transcript. It takes into account ; all factors being modeled that will effect the probability of sampling fragments from; this transcript, including the fragment length distribution and sequence-specific and ; gc-fragment bias (if they are being modeled). * **TPM** ---; This is salmon's estimate of the relative abundance of this transcript in units of Transcripts Per Million (TPM).; TPM is the recommended relative abundance measure to use for downstream analysis. . * **NumReads** --- ; This is salmon's estimate of the number of reads mapping to each transcript that was quantified. It is an ""estimate"" ; insofar as it is the expected number of reads that have originated from each transcript given the structure of the uniquely ; mapping and multi-mapping reads and the relative abundance estimates for each transcript. Command Information File; ------------------------. In the top-level quantification directory, there will be a file called ``cmd_info.json``. This is a; JSON format file that records the main command line parameters with which Salmon was invoked for the ; run that produced the output in this directory. Auxiliary Files; ---------------. The top-level quantification directory will contain an auxiliary directory called ``aux_info`` (unless ; the auxiliary directory name was overridden via the command line). This directory will have a number; of files (and subfolders) depending on how salmon was i

After downloading the Salmon source distribution and unpacking it, change into the top-level directory:. ::. > cd salmon. Then, create and out-of-source build directory and change into it:. ::. > mkdir build; > cd build. Salmon makes extensive use of Boost_. We recommend installing the most; recent version (1.55) systemwide if possible. If Boost is not installed on your; system, the build process will fetch, compile and install it locally. However,; if you already have a recent version of Boost available on your system, it make; sense to tell the build system to use that.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: the latest version; from DockerHub using:. ::. > docker pull combinelab/salmon; . Requirements for Building from Source; -------------------------------------. * A C++11 conformant compiler (currently tested with GCC>=4.7 and Clang>=3.4); * CMake_. Salmon uses the CMake build system to check, fetch and install; dependencies, and to compile and install Salmon. CMake is available for all; major platforms (though Salmon is currently unsupported on Windows.); ; Installation; ============. After downloading the Salmon source distribution and unpacking it, change into the top-level directory:. ::. > cd salmon. Then, create and out-of-source build directory and change into it:. ::. > mkdir build; > cd build. Salmon makes extensive use of Boost_. We recommend installing the most; recent version (1.55) systemwide if possible. If Boost is not installed on your; system, the build process will fetch, compile and install it locally. However,; if you already have a recent version of Boost available on your system, it make; sense to tell the build system to use that. If you have Boost installed you can tell CMake where to look for it. Likewise,; if you already have `Intel's Threading Building Blocks; <http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`_ library installed, you can tell CMake; where it is as well. The flags for CMake are as follows:. * -DFETCH_BOOST=TRUE -- If you don't have Boost installed (or have an older; version of it), you can provide the FETCH_BOOST flag instead of the; BOOST_ROOT variable, which will cause CMake to fetch and build Boost locally. * -DBOOST_ROOT=<boostdir> -- Tells CMake where an existing installtion of Boost; resides, and looks for the appropritate version in <boostdir>. This is the; top-level directory where Boost is installed (e.g. /opt/local). * -DTBB_INSTALL_DIR=<tbbroot> -- Tells CMake where an existing installation of; Intel's TBB is installed (<tbbroot>), and looks for the apropriate headers; and libraries there. This is the top-level directory where

Deployability,"Alevin; ================. Alevin is a tool --- integrated with the salmon software --- that introduces a family of algorithms for quantification and analysis of 3' tagged-end single-cell sequencing data. Currently alevin supports the following single-cell protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v1/2/3; 3. inDropV2; 4. CELSeq 1/2; 5. Quartz-Seq2; 6. sci-RNA-seq3. Alevin works under the same indexing scheme (as salmon) for the reference, and consumes the set of FASTA/Q files(s) containing the Cellular Barcode(CB) + Unique Molecule identifier (UMI) in one read file and the read sequence in the other. Given just the transcriptome and the raw read files, alevin generates a cell-by-gene count matrix (in a fraction of the time compared to other tools). Alevin works in two phases. In the first phase it quickly parses the read file containing the CB and UMI information to generate the frequency distribution of all the observed CBs, and creates a lightweight data-structure for fast-look up and correction of the CB. In the second round, alevin utilizes the read-sequences contained in the files to map the reads to the transcriptome, identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions. Finally, a post-abundance estimation CB whitelisting procedure is done and a cell-by-gene count matrix is generated. Using Alevin; ------------.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Alevin; ================. Alevin is a tool --- integrated with the salmon software --- that introduces a family of algorithms for quantification and analysis of 3' tagged-end single-cell sequencing data. Currently alevin supports the following single-cell protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v1/2/3; 3. inDropV2; 4. CELSeq 1/2; 5. Quartz-Seq2; 6. sci-RNA-seq3. Alevin works under the same indexing scheme (as salmon) for the reference, and consumes the set of FASTA/Q files(s) containing the Cellular Barcode(CB) + Unique Molecule identifier (UMI) in one read file and the read sequence in the other. Given just the transcriptome and the raw read files, alevin generates a cell-by-gene count matrix (in a fraction of the time compared to other tools). Alevin works in two phases. In the first phase it quickly parses the read file containing the CB and UMI information to generate the frequency distribution of all the observed CBs, and creates a lightweight data-structure for fast-look up and correction of the CB.

Deployability,"OST_ROOT=<boostdir> -- Tells CMake where an existing installtion of Boost; resides, and looks for the appropritate version in <boostdir>. This is the; top-level directory where Boost is installed (e.g. /opt/local). * -DTBB_INSTALL_DIR=<tbbroot> -- Tells CMake where an existing installation of; Intel's TBB is installed (<tbbroot>), and looks for the apropriate headers; and libraries there.

If you don't specify this option,; it will be installed locally in the top-level directory (i.e. the directory; directly above ""build""). There are a number of other libraries upon which Salmon depends, but CMake ; should fetch these for you automatically. Setting the appropriate flags, you can then run the CMake configure step as; follows:. ::; ; > cmake [FLAGS] .. The above command is the cmake configuration step, which *should* complain if; anything goes wrong. Next, you have to run the build step. Depending on what; libraries need to be fetched and installed, this could take a while; (specifically if the installation needs to install Boost). To start the build,; just run make. ::. > make. If the build is successful, the appropriate executables and libraries should be; created. There are two points to note about the build process. First, if the; build system is downloading and compiling boost, you may see a large number of; warnings during compilation; these are normal. Second, note that CMake has; colored output by default, and the steps which create or link libraries are; printed in red.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: OST_ROOT=<boostdir> -- Tells CMake where an existing installtion of Boost; resides, and looks for the appropritate version in <boostdir>. This is the; top-level directory where Boost is installed (e.g. /opt/local). * -DTBB_INSTALL_DIR=<tbbroot> -- Tells CMake where an existing installation of; Intel's TBB is installed (<tbbroot>), and looks for the apropriate headers; and libraries there. This is the top-level directory where TBB is installed; (e.g. /opt/local). * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> -- <install_dir> is the directory to; which you wish Salmon to be installed. If you don't specify this option,; it will be installed locally in the top-level directory (i.e. the directory; directly above ""build""). There are a number of other libraries upon which Salmon depends, but CMake ; should fetch these for you automatically. Setting the appropriate flags, you can then run the CMake configure step as; follows:. ::; ; > cmake [FLAGS] .. The above command is the cmake configuration step, which *should* complain if; anything goes wrong. Next, you have to run the build step. Depending on what; libraries need to be fetched and installed, this could take a while; (specifically if the installation needs to install Boost). To start the build,; just run make. ::. > make. If the build is successful, the appropriate executables and libraries should be; created. There are two points to note about the build process. First, if the; build system is downloading and compiling boost, you may see a large number of; warnings during compilation; these are normal. Second, note that CMake has; colored output by default, and the steps which create or link libraries are; printed in red. This is the color chosen by CMake for linking messages, and; does not denote an error in the build process. ; ; Finally, after everything is built, the libraries and executable can be; installed with:. ::; ; > make install.

Energy Efficiency,"as been shown to reduce isoform quantification errors [#alpine]_ [#salmon]_. This bias is distinct from the primer biases learned with the ``--seqBias`` option.; Though these biases are distinct, they are not completely independent.; When both ``--seqBias`` and ``--gcBias`` are enabled, Salmon will; learn a conditional fragment-GC bias model. By default, Salmon will; learn 3 different fragment-GC bias models based on the GC content of; the fragment start and end contexts, though this number of conditional; models can be changed with the (*hidden*) option; ``--conditionalGCBins``. Likewise, the number of distinct fragment GC; bins used to model the GC bias can be changed with the (*hidden*); option ``--numGCBins``. *Note* : In order to speed up the evaluation of the GC content of; arbitrary fragments, Salmon pre-computes and stores the cumulative GC; count for each transcript. This requires an extra 4-bytes per; nucleotide. While this extra memory usage should normally be minor,; it can nonetheless be controlled with the ``--reduceGCMemory`` option.; This option replaces the per-nucleotide GC count with a rank-select; capable bit vector, reducing the memory overhead from 4-bytes per; nucleotide to ~1.25 bits, while being only marginally slower).

Passing the ``--posBias`` flag to Salmon will enable modeling of a; position-specific fragment start distribution. This is meant to model; non-uniform coverage biases that are sometimes present in RNA-seq data; (e.g. 5' or 3' positional bias). Currently, a small and fixed number; of models are learned for different length classes of transcripts, as; is done in Roberts et al.

This bias is distinct from the primer biases learned with the ``--seqBias`` option.; Though these biases are distinct, they are not completely independent.; When both ``--seqBias`` and ``--gcBias`` are enabled, Salmon will; learn a conditional fragment-GC bias model.

Likewise, the number of distinct fragment GC; bins used to model the GC bias can be changed with the (*hidden*); option ``--numGCBins``. *Note* : In order to speed up the evaluation of the GC content of; arbitrary fragments, Salmon pre-computes and stores the cumulative GC; count for each transcript. This requires an extra 4-bytes per; nucleotide. While this extra memory usage should normally be minor,; it can nonetheless be controlled with the ``--reduceGCMemory`` option.; This option replaces the per-nucleotide GC count with a rank-select; capable bit vector, reducing the memory overhead from 4-bytes per; nucleotide to ~1.25 bits, while being only marginally slower).

Single-cell protocol specific notes; ------------------------------------. In cases where single-cell protocol supports variable length cellbarcodes, alevin adds nucleotide padding to make the lengths uniform.; Furthermore, the padding scheme ensures that there are no collisions added in the process. The padding scheme is as follows:. 1. sci-RNA-seq3: The barcode is composed of 9-10 bp hairpin adaptor and 10 bp reverse transcription index making it 19-20 bp long. If the bacode is 20 bp long, alevin adds *A* and it adds *AC* if it is 19 bp long. Thus, the length of barcode in the output is 21 bp.; 2. inDropV2: 8-11 bp barcode1 along with 8 bp barcode2 makes up the barcode. For barcode lengths of 16, 17, 18, and 19 bp, alevin adds *AAAC*, *AAG*, *AT*, and *A* respectively. Thus, the length of barcode in the output is 20 bp. Furthermore, the position of barcode1 is dependent on finding exact match of sequence ``w1``. If exact match is not found, a search for ``w1`` is performed allowing a maximum hamming distance 2 b/w ``w1`` and read2 substring of w1 length within the required bounds; the first match is returned. .

In the first phase it quickly parses the read file containing the CB and UMI information to generate the frequency distribution of all the observed CBs, and creates a lightweight data-structure for fast-look up and correction of the CB. In the second round, alevin utilizes the read-sequences contained in the files to map the reads to the transcriptome, identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions.

In the second round, alevin utilizes the read-sequences contained in the files to map the reads to the transcriptome, identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions. Finally, a post-abundance estimation CB whitelisting procedure is done and a cell-by-gene count matrix is generated. Using Alevin; ------------. Alevin requires the following minimal set of necessary input parameters (generally providing the flags *in that order* is recommended):. * ``-l``: library type (same as salmon), we recommend using `ISR` for both Drop-seq and 10x-v2 chemistry.; * ``-1``: CB+UMI file(s), alevin requires the path to the *FASTQ* file containing CB+UMI raw sequences to be given under this command line flag. Alevin also supports parsing of data from multiple files as long as the order is the same as in `-2` flag.; * ``-2``: Read-sequence file(s), alevin requires the path to the *FASTQ* file containing raw

There are a number of other libraries upon which Salmon depends, but CMake ; should fetch these for you automatically. Setting the appropriate flags, you can then run the CMake configure step as; follows:. ::; ; > cmake [FLAGS] .. The above command is the cmake configuration step, which *should* complain if; anything goes wrong. Next, you have to run the build step. Depending on what; libraries need to be fetched and installed, this could take a while; (specifically if the installation needs to install Boost). To start the build,; just run make. ::. > make. If the build is successful, the appropriate executables and libraries should be; created. There are two points to note about the build process. First, if the; build system is downloading and compiling boost, you may see a large number of; warnings during compilation; these are normal. Second, note that CMake has; colored output by default, and the steps which create or link libraries are; printed in red. This is the color chosen by CMake for linking messages, and; does not denote an error i

Integrability,"Requirements; ============. Binary Releases; ---------------. Pre-compiled binaries of the latest release of Salmon for a number different; platforms are available available under the `Releases tab; <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases>`_ of Salmon's `GitHub; repository <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon>`_. You should be able to; get started quickly by finding a binary from the list that is compatible with; your platform. Additionally, you can obtain a Docker image of the latest version; from DockerHub using:. ::. > docker pull combinelab/salmon; . Requirements for Building from Source; -------------------------------------. * A C++11 conformant compiler (currently tested with GCC>=4.7 and Clang>=3.4); * CMake_. Salmon uses the CMake build system to check, fetch and install; dependencies, and to compile and install Salmon. CMake is available for all; major platforms (though Salmon is currently unsupported on Windows.); ; Installation; ============. After downloading the Salmon source distribution and unpacking it, change into the top-level directory:. ::. > cd salmon. Then, create and out-of-source build directory and change into it:. ::. > mkdir build; > cd build. Salmon makes extensive use of Boost_. We recommend installing the most; recent version (1.55) systemwide if possible. If Boost is not installed on your; system, the build process will fetch, compile and install it locally. However,; if you already have a recent version of Boost available on your system, it make; sense to tell the build system to use that. If you have Boost installed you can tell CMake where to look for it. Likewise,; if you already have `Intel's Threading Building Blocks; <http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`_ library installed, you can tell CMake; where it is as well. The flags for CMake are as follows:. * -DFETCH_BOOST=TRUE -- If you don't have Boost installed (or have an older; version of it), you can provide the FETCH_BOOST flag instead of the; BOOST_ROOT variable, whi",depend,MatchSource.DOCS,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v1.10.1/doc/source/building.rst:802,dependencies,802,doc/source/building.rst,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v1.10.1/doc/source/building.rst,1,['depend'],['dependencies'],"The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: Requirements; ============. Binary Releases; ---------------. Pre-compiled binaries of the latest release of Salmon for a number different; platforms are available available under the `Releases tab; <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases>`_ of Salmon's `GitHub; repository <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon>`_. You should be able to; get started quickly by finding a binary from the list that is compatible with; your platform. Additionally, you can obtain a Docker image of the latest version; from DockerHub using:. ::. > docker pull combinelab/salmon; . Requirements for Building from Source; -------------------------------------. * A C++11 conformant compiler (currently tested with GCC>=4.7 and Clang>=3.4); * CMake_. Salmon uses the CMake build system to check, fetch and install; dependencies, and to compile and install Salmon. CMake is available for all; major platforms (though Salmon is currently unsupported on Windows.); ; Installation; ============. After downloading the Salmon source distribution and unpacking it, change into the top-level directory:. ::. > cd salmon. Then, create and out-of-source build directory and change into it:. ::. > mkdir build; > cd build. Salmon makes extensive use of Boost_. We recommend installing the most; recent version (1.55) systemwide if possible. If Boost is not installed on your; system, the build process will fetch, compile and install it locally. However,; if you already have a recent version of Boost available on your system, it make; sense to tell the build system to use that. If you have Boost installed you can tell CMake where to look for it. Likewise,; if you already have `Intel's Threading Building Blocks; <http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`_ library installed, you can tell CMake; where it is as well. The flags for CMake are as follows:. * -DFETCH_BOOST=TRUE -- If you don't have Boost installed (or have an older; version of it), you can provide the FETCH_BOOST flag instead of the; BOOST_ROOT variable, whi

Integrability,"_. Using Salmon; ------------. As mentioned above, there are two ""modes"" of operation for Salmon. The first,; requires you to build an index for the transcriptome, but then subsequently; processes reads directly. The second mode simply requires you to provide a; FASTA file of the transcriptome and a ``.sam`` or ``.bam`` file containing a; set of alignments. .. note:: Read / alignment order. Salmon, like eXpress [#express]_, uses a streaming inference method to perform ; transcript-level quantification. One of the fundamental assumptions ; of such inference methods is that observations (i.e. reads or alignments); are made ""at random"". This means, for example, that alignments should ; **not** be sorted by target or position. If your reads or alignments ; do not appear in a random order with respect to the target transcripts,; please randomize / shuffle them before performing quantification with ; Salmon. .. note:: Number of Threads. The number of threads that Salmon can effectively make use of depends ; upon the mode in which it is being run. In alignment-based mode, the; main bottleneck is in parsing and decompressing the input BAM file.; We make use of the `Staden IO <http://sourceforge.net/projects/staden/files/io_lib/>`_ ; library for SAM/BAM/CRAM I/O (CRAM is, in theory, supported, but has not been; thoroughly tested). This means that multiple threads can be effectively used; to aid in BAM decompression. However, we find that throwing more than a ; few threads at file decompression does not result in increased processing; speed. Thus, alignment-based Salmon will only ever allocate up to 4 threads; to file decompression, with the rest being allocated to quantification.; If these threads are starved, they will sleep (the quantification threads ; do not busy wait), but there is a point beyond which allocating more threads; will not speed up alignment-based quantification.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: inal part of the library; string specifies the strand from which the read originates in a strand-specific; protocol — it is only provided if the library is stranded (i.e. if the; library format string is of the form S). The possible values are:. ::. F = read 1 (or single-end read) comes from the forward strand; R = read 1 (or single-end read) comes from the reverse strand. An example of some library format strings and their interpretations are:. ::. IU (an unstranded paired-end library where the reads face each other). ::. SF (a stranded single-end protocol where the reads come from the forward strand). ::. OSR (a stranded paired-end protocol where the reads face away from each other,; read1 comes from reverse strand and read2 comes from the forward strand). .. note:: Strand Matching. Above, when it is said that the read ""comes from"" a strand, we mean that; the read should align with / map to that strand. For example, for; libraries having the ``OSR`` protocol as described above, we expect that; read1 maps to the reverse strand, and read2 maps to the forward strand. .

Sailfish documentation master file, created by; sphinx-quickstart on Tue Jul 15 17:48:43 2014.; You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least; contain the root `toctree` directive. Welcome to Salmon's documentation!; =============================================. Contents:. .. toctree::; :maxdepth: 2; ; building.rst; salmon.rst; alevin.rst; file_formats.rst; library_type.rst. Indices and tables; ==================. * :ref:`genindex`; * :ref:`modindex`; * :ref:`search`. 

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Modifiability,".; It matters only when ``--validateMappings`` has been passed to Salmon. The maximum; possible score for a fragment is ``ms = read_len * ma`` (or ``ms = (left_read_len + right_read_len) * ma``; for paired-end reads). The argument to ``--minScoreFraction`` determines what fraction of the maximum; score ``s`` a mapping must achieve to be potentially retained. For a minimum score fraction of ``f``, only; mappings with a score > ``f * s`` will be kept. Mappings with lower scores will be considered as low-quality,; and will be discarded. It is worth noting that mapping validation uses extension alignment. This means that the read need not; map end-to-end. Instead, the score of the mapping will be the position along the alignment with the; highest score. This is the score which must reach the fraction threshold for the read to be considered; as valid. Single-cell protocol specific notes; ------------------------------------. In cases where single-cell protocol supports variable length cellbarcodes, alevin adds nucleotide padding to make the lengths uniform.; Furthermore, the padding scheme ensures that there are no collisions added in the process. The padding scheme is as follows:. 1. sci-RNA-seq3: The barcode is composed of 9-10 bp hairpin adaptor and 10 bp reverse transcription index making it 19-20 bp long. If the bacode is 20 bp long, alevin adds *A* and it adds *AC* if it is 19 bp long. Thus, the length of barcode in the output is 21 bp.; 2. inDropV2: 8-11 bp barcode1 along with 8 bp barcode2 makes up the barcode. For barcode lengths of 16, 17, 18, and 19 bp, alevin adds *AAAC*, *AAG*, *AT*, and *A* respectively. Thus, the length of barcode in the output is 20 bp. Furthermore, the position of barcode1 is dependent on finding exact match of sequence ``w1``. If exact match is not found, a search for ``w1`` is performed allowing a maximum hamming distance 2 b/w ``w1`` and read2 substring of w1 length within the required bounds; the first match is returned. .

Then, create and out-of-source build directory and change into it:. ::. > mkdir build; > cd build. Salmon makes extensive use of Boost_. We recommend installing the most; recent version (1.55) systemwide if possible. If Boost is not installed on your; system, the build process will fetch, compile and install it locally. However,; if you already have a recent version of Boost available on your system, it make; sense to tell the build system to use that. If you have Boost installed you can tell CMake where to look for it. Likewise,; if you already have `Intel's Threading Building Blocks; <http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`_ library installed, you can tell CMake; where it is as well. The flags for CMake are as follows:. * -DFETCH_BOOST=TRUE -- If you don't have Boost installed (or have an older; version of it), you can provide the FETCH_BOOST flag instead of the; BOOST_ROOT variable, which will cause CMake to fetch and build Boost locally. * -DBOOST_ROOT=<boostdir> -- Tells CMake where an existing installtion of Boost; resides, and looks for the appropritate version in <boostdir>. This is the; top-level directory where Boost is installed (e.g. /opt/local). * -DTBB_INSTALL_DIR=<tbbroot> -- Tells CMake where an existing installation of; Intel's TBB is installed (<tbbroot>), and looks for the apropriate headers; and libraries there. This is the top-level directory where TBB is installed; (e.g. /opt/local). * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> -- <install_dir> is the directory to; which you wish Salmon to be installed. If you don't specify this option,; it will be installed locally in the top-level directory (i.e. the directory; directly above ""build"").

Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: ows.); ; Installation; ============. After downloading the Salmon source distribution and unpacking it, change into the top-level directory:. ::. > cd salmon. Then, create and out-of-source build directory and change into it:. ::. > mkdir build; > cd build. Salmon makes extensive use of Boost_. We recommend installing the most; recent version (1.55) systemwide if possible. If Boost is not installed on your; system, the build process will fetch, compile and install it locally. However,; if you already have a recent version of Boost available on your system, it make; sense to tell the build system to use that. If you have Boost installed you can tell CMake where to look for it. Likewise,; if you already have `Intel's Threading Building Blocks; <http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`_ library installed, you can tell CMake; where it is as well. The flags for CMake are as follows:. * -DFETCH_BOOST=TRUE -- If you don't have Boost installed (or have an older; version of it), you can provide the FETCH_BOOST flag instead of the; BOOST_ROOT variable, which will cause CMake to fetch and build Boost locally. * -DBOOST_ROOT=<boostdir> -- Tells CMake where an existing installtion of Boost; resides, and looks for the appropritate version in <boostdir>. This is the; top-level directory where Boost is installed (e.g. /opt/local). * -DTBB_INSTALL_DIR=<tbbroot> -- Tells CMake where an existing installation of; Intel's TBB is installed (<tbbroot>), and looks for the apropriate headers; and libraries there. This is the top-level directory where TBB is installed; (e.g. /opt/local). * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> -- <install_dir> is the directory to; which you wish Salmon to be installed. If you don't specify this option,; it will be installed locally in the top-level directory (i.e. the directory; directly above ""build""). There are a number of other libraries upon which Salmon depends, but CMake ; should fetch these for you automatically. Setting the appropriate flags, you can the

In cases where single-cell protocol supports variable length cellbarcodes, alevin adds nucleotide padding to make the lengths uniform.; Furthermore, the padding scheme ensures that there are no collisions added in the process. The padding scheme is as follows:. 1. sci-RNA-seq3: The barcode is composed of 9-10 bp hairpin adaptor and 10 bp reverse transcription index making it 19-20 bp long. If the bacode is 20 bp long, alevin adds *A* and it adds *AC* if it is 19 bp long. Thus, the length of barcode in the output is 21 bp.; 2. inDropV2: 8-11 bp barcode1 along with 8 bp barcode2 makes up the barcode. For barcode lengths of 16, 17, 18, and 19 bp, alevin adds *AAAC*, *AAG*, *AT*, and *A* respectively. Thus, the length of barcode in the output is 20 bp.

As with the flags described above, this is a ""meta-flag"" that simply enables some options; that may make more sense when quantifying metagenomic data. Specifically, the ``--meta``; flag sets the following options: . * The abundance optimization is initialized from the uniform distribution (compared to the default of using a weighted combination of the uniform intialization and the abundances learned during the online optimization). * Rich equivalence classes are disabled. Using rich equivalence classes with metagenomic data should not be particularly problematic, but since they have been developed and tested most in the context of bulk RNA-seq quantification, they are currently disabled under this flag. * The EM algorithm is used for abundance optimization instead of the default VBEM optimization. Neither is universally better than the other, but the parameters for the VBEM (e.g. the prior size and type) are set based on typical bulk RNA-seq transcriptome samples, and so may be less appropriate in the metagenomic context. Hence the ``--meta`` flags opts for the basic EM algorithm instead.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: ut using the default scoring scheme and allowing both mismatches and; indels in alignments. These setting essentially disallow indels in the resulting; alignments. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; ``--meta``; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". As with the flags described above, this is a ""meta-flag"" that simply enables some options; that may make more sense when quantifying metagenomic data. Specifically, the ``--meta``; flag sets the following options: . * The abundance optimization is initialized from the uniform distribution (compared to the default of using a weighted combination of the uniform intialization and the abundances learned during the online optimization). * Rich equivalence classes are disabled. Using rich equivalence classes with metagenomic data should not be particularly problematic, but since they have been developed and tested most in the context of bulk RNA-seq quantification, they are currently disabled under this flag. * The EM algorithm is used for abundance optimization instead of the default VBEM optimization. Neither is universally better than the other, but the parameters for the VBEM (e.g. the prior size and type) are set based on typical bulk RNA-seq transcriptome samples, and so may be less appropriate in the metagenomic context. Hence the ``--meta`` flags opts for the basic EM algorithm instead. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; ``--recoverOrphans``; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". This flag (which should only be used in conjunction with selective alignment),; performs orphan ""rescue"" for reads. That is, if mappings are discovered for only; one end of a fragment, or if the mappings for the ends of the fragment don't; fall on the same transcript, then this flag will cause salmon to look upstream; or downstream of the discovered mapping (anchor) for a match for the opposite; end of the given fragment.

Safety,"``?; ------------------------. Salmon, has the user provide a description of the type of sequencing; library from which the reads come, and this contains information about; e.g. the relative orientation of paired-end reads. As of version; 0.7.0, Salmon also has the ability to automatically infer (i.e. guess); the library type based on how the first few thousand reads map to the; transcriptome. To allow Salmon to automatically infer the library; type, simply provide ``-l A`` or ``--libType A`` to Salmon. Even if you; allow Salmon to infer the library type for you, you should still read; the section below, so that you can interpret how Salmon reports the; library type it discovers. .. note:: Automatic library type detection in alignment-based mode. The implementation of this feature involves opening the BAM; file, peaking at the first record, and then closing it to; determine if the library should be treated as single-end or; paired-end. Thus, *in alignment-based mode* automatic; library type detection will not work with an input; stream. If your input is a regular file, everything should; work as expected; otherwise, you should provide the library; type explicitly in alignment-based mode.; ; Also the automatic library type detection is performed *on the; basis of the alignments in the file*. Thus, for example, if the; upstream aligner has been told to perform strand-aware mapping; (i.e. to ignore potential alignments that don't map in the; expected manner), but the actual library is unstranded,; automatic library type detection cannot detect this. It will; attempt to detect the library type that is most consistent *with; the alignment that are provided*.

Third, you could use a tool like `sam-xlate <https://github.com/mozack/ubu/wiki>`_; to try and convert the genome-coordinate BAM files directly into transcript ; coordinates. This avoids the necessity of having to re-map the reads. However,; we have very limited experience with this tool so far. .. topic:: Multiple alignment files; ; If your alignments for the sample you want to quantify appear in multiple ; .bam/.sam files, then you can simply provide the Salmon ``-a`` parameter ; with a (space-separated) list of these files. Salmon will automatically ; read through these one after the other quantifying transcripts using the ; alignments contained therein. However, it is currently the case that these; separate files must (1) all be of the same library type and (2) all be; aligned with respect to the same reference (i.e. the @SQ records in the ; header sections must be identical). Description of some important options; -------------------------------------. Salmon exposes a number of useful optional command-line parameters to the user.; The particularly important ones are explained here, but you can always run; ``salmon quant -h`` to see them all.

Typical 10x experiment can range form hundreds to tens of thousand of cells -- resulting in huge size of the count-matrices. Traditionally single-cell tools dumps the Cell-v-Gene count matrix in various formats. Although, this itself is an open area of research but by default alevin dumps a per-cell level gene-count matrix in a binary-compressed format with the row and column indexes in a separate file.

When salmon is run with selective alignment, it adopts a; considerably more sensitive scheme that we have developed for finding the; potential mapping loci of a read, and score potential mapping loci using; the chaining algorithm introduced in minimap2 [#minimap2]_. It scores and; validates these mappings using the score-only, SIMD, dynamic programming; algorithm of ksw2 [#ksw2]_. Finally, we recommend using selective; alignment with a *decoy-aware* transcriptome, to mitigate potential; spurious mapping of reads that actually arise from some unannotated; genomic locus that is sequence-similar to an annotated transcriptome. The; selective-alignment algorithm, the use of a decoy-aware transcriptome, and; the influence of running salmon with different mapping and alignment; strategies is covered in detail in the paper `Alignment and mapping methodology influence transcript abundance estimation <https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8>`_. The use of selective alignment implies the use of range factorization, as mapping; scores become very meaningful with this option. Selective alignment can; improve the accuracy, sometimes considerably, over the faster, but; less-precise mapping algorithm that was previously used. Also, there are a number of ; options and flags that allow

What is Salmon?; ===============. Salmon is a **wicked**-fast program to produce a highly-accurate, transcript-level quantification estimates from ; RNA-seq data. Salmon achieves its accuracy and speed via a number of different innovations, including the ; use of *selective-alignment* (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments), and ; massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference. The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely; into many different pipelines. For example, you can choose to make use of our *selective-alignment* algorithm by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. an **unsorted** BAM file with alignments to the transcriptome produced with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same **wicked**-fast, state-of-the-art inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment.

What is Salmon?; ===============. Salmon is a **wicked**-fast program to produce a highly-accurate, transcript-level quantification estimates from ; RNA-seq data. Salmon achieves its accuracy and speed via a number of different innovations, including the ; use of *selective-alignment* (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments), and ; massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference. The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely; into many different pipelines. For example, you can choose to make use of our *selective-alignment* algorithm by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. an **unsorted** BAM file with alignments to the transcriptome produced with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same **wicked**-fast, state-of-the-art inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment. Give salmon a try! You can find the latest binary releases [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases). The current version number of the master branch of

Salmon achieves its accuracy and speed via a number of different innovations, including the ; use of *selective-alignment* (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments), and ; massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference. The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely; into many different pipelines. For example, you can choose to make use of our *selective-alignment* algorithm by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. an **unsorted** BAM file with alignments to the transcriptome produced with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same **wicked**-fast, state-of-the-art inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment. Give salmon a try! You can find the latest binary releases [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases). The current version number of the master branch of

While this extra memory usage should normally be minor,; it can nonetheless be controlled with the ``--reduceGCMemory`` option.; This option replaces the per-nucleotide GC count with a rank-select; capable bit vector, reducing the memory overhead from 4-bytes per; nucleotide to ~1.25 bits, while being only marginally slower).

Passing the ``--posBias`` flag to Salmon will enable modeling of a; position-specific fragment start distribution. This is meant to model; non-uniform coverage biases that are sometimes present in RNA-seq data; (e.g. 5' or 3' positional bias). Currently, a small and fixed number; of models are learned for different length classes of transcripts, as; is done in Roberts et al. [#roberts]_. *Note*: The positional bias; model is relatively new, and is still undergoing testing. It replaces; the previous `--useFSPD` option, which is now deprecated. This; feature should be considered as *experimental* in the current release.

When evaluating the bias models (the GC-fragment model specifically),; Salmon must consider the probability of generating a fragment of every; possible length (with a non-trivial probability) from every position; on every transcript. This results in a process that is quadratic in; the length of the transcriptome --- though each evaluation itself is; efficient and the process is highly parallelized. It is possible to speed this process up by a multiplicative factor by; considering only every *i*:sup:`th` fragment length, and interpolating; the intermediate results.
