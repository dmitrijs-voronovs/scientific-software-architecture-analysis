Older dates already formatted and stored by previous versions of; Cromwell will not be updated however they will still return a; [valid ISO-8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

When a Cromwell instance is unable to write heartbeats for some period of time it will automatically shut down. For more; information see the docs on [configuring Workflow Hearbeats](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Configuring/). NOTE: In the remote chance that the `system.workflow-heartbeats.ttl` has been configured to be less than `5 minutes`; then the new configuration value `system.workflow-heartbeats.write-failure-shutdown-duration` must also be explicitly; set less than the `ttl`. #### nVidia Driver Attribute Change. The runtime attribute `nvidia-driver-version` was previously allowed only as a default runtime attribute in configuration.; Because WDL does not allow attribute names to contain `-` characters, this has been changed to `nvidiaDriverVersion`.; This field is now accepted within WDL files as well as within the configuration file. #### Logging long running jobs. All backends can now emit slow job warnings after a configurable time running. ; NB This example shows how to configure this setting for the PAPIv2 backend:; ```conf; # Emit a warning if jobs last longer than this amount of time. This might indicate that something got stuck.; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config { ; slow-job-warning-time: 24 hours; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Runtime Attributes. #### GPU Attributes. * The `gpuType` attribute is no longer validated against a whitelist at workflow submission time. Instead, validation now happens at runtime. T

E.g.:. ```; {; ""defaultRuntimeOptions"": {; ""docker"": ""ubuntu:latest""; }; }; ```; - Changed the JES runtime attributes `defaultDisks` and `defaultZones` to be simply `disks` and `zones` respectively.; - Liquibase scripts now run automatically. Non-persistent, in-memory databases are not affected. However Cromwell will; not start if it detects evidence of manually run liquibase migrations in a persistent database.

Content: - The deprecated parse, validate, inputs and highlight functionality from the command line tool has been removed in favor of wdltool (https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool); - Workflow options can now include a `defaultRuntimeOptions` section, so that the same runtime attribute is not needed in every single WDL task. E.g.:. ```; {; ""defaultRuntimeOptions"": {; ""docker"": ""ubuntu:latest""; }; }; ```; - Changed the JES runtime attributes `defaultDisks` and `defaultZones` to be simply `disks` and `zones` respectively.; - Liquibase scripts now run automatically. Non-persistent, in-memory databases are not affected. However Cromwell will; not start if it detects evidence of manually run liquibase migrations in a persistent database. Instead, before Cromwell; will start cleanly, the database should backed up, and then this SQL should be manually executed:. ``` sql; update DATABASECHANGELOG; set MD5SUM = null,; FILENAME = substr(FILENAME, instr(FILENAME, ""src/main/migrations/"") + length(""src/main/migrations/"")); where FILENAME like '%src/main/migrations/%'; ```; - Added Preemptible VMs support for JES. This has impacts on the API Endpoint responses as a Call/Shard can now be attempted multiple times. Each attempt will have its own entry.; - Added custom thread pool to workaround Slick [deadlocks](https://github.com/slick/slick/issues/1274). The thread pool; size defaults to the Slick configuration value `db.numThreads`, but may be increased up to Slick's; `db.maxConnections`, via a new property `actionThreadPoolSize`.; - Added support for [size](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/blob/develop/SPEC.md#float-sizefile-string) WDL standard library function.; - Allow for runtime attribute values to be interpreted as full expressions. For example:. ```; task example {; String ubuntu_tag; command { ... }; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu:"" + ubuntu_tag; }; }; ```; - Add runtime attributes in Call metadata :. ```; {; ""workflowName"": ""hello"",; ""calls"": {; ""hello.hello"": [; {; ...,; ""r

Modifiability,"### External Contributors; * A special thank you to @adamstruck, @antonkulaga and @delocalizer for their contributions to Cromwell.; ### Breaking Changes. * Metadata keys for call caching are changed. All call caching keys are now in a `callCaching` stanza. `Call cache read result` has moved here and is now `result`. The `allowResultReuse` and `effectiveCallCachingMode` have moved here. The `hit` boolean is a simple indication of whether or not it was a hit, with no additional information.

The `hit` boolean is a simple indication of whether or not it was a hit, with no additional information. An example using the new format is:; ```; ""callCaching"": {; ""hit"": false,; ""effectiveCallCachingMode"": ""ReadAndWriteCache"",; ""result"": ""Cache Miss"",; ""allowResultReuse"": true; }; ```. ### Config Changes. * Added a field `insert-batch-size` to the `database` stanza which defines how many values from a batch insert will be processed at a time. This value defaults to 2000. ; * Moved the config value `services.MetadataService.metadata-summary-refresh-interval` to `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`; * Added ability to override the default zone(s) used by JES via the config structure by setting `genomics.default-zones` in the JES configuration; * The cromwell server TCP binding timeout is now configurable via the config key `webservice.binding-timeout`, defaulted; to the previous value `5s` (five seconds) via the reference.conf.; * For MySQL users, a massive scalability improvement via batched DB writing of internal metadata events. Note that one must add `rewriteBatchedStatements=true` to their JDBC URL in their config in order to take advantage of this. ### General Changes. * Cromwell's WDL parser now recognizes empty array literals correctly, e.g. `Array[String] emptyArray = []`.; * Cromwell now applies default labels automatically to JES pipeline runs.; * Added support for new WDL functions:; * `length: (Array[X]) => Integer` - report the length of the specified array; * `prefix: (String, Array[X]) => Array[String]` - generate an array consisting of each element of the input array prefixed; by a specified `String`. The input array can have elements of any primitive type, the return array will always have; type `Array[String]`.; * `defined: (Any) =

Cromwell's WDL 1.0 implementation now allows empty call blocks, e.g. `call task_with_no_inputs {}`. This brings 1.0 in line with

An example using the new format is:; ```; ""callCaching"": {; ""hit"": false,; ""effectiveCallCachingMode"": ""ReadAndWriteCache"",; ""result"": ""Cache Miss"",; ""allowResultReuse"": true; }; ```. ### Config Changes. * Added a field `insert-batch-size` to the `database` stanza which defines how many values from a batch insert will be processed at a time. This value defaults to 2000. ; * Moved the config value `services.MetadataService.metadata-summary-refresh-interval` to `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`; * Added ability to override the default zone(s) used by JES via the config structure by setting `genomics.default-zones` in the JES configuration; * The cromwell server TCP binding timeout is now configurable via the config key `webservice.binding-timeout`, defaulted; to the previous value `5s` (five seconds) via the reference.conf.; * For MySQL users, a massive scalability improvement via batched DB writing of internal metadata events. Note that one must add `rewriteBatchedStatements=true` to their JDBC URL in their config in order to take advantage of this. ### General Changes. * Cromwell's WDL parser now recognizes empty array literals correctly, e.g. `Array[String] emptyArray = []`.; * Cromwell now applies default labels automatically to JES pipeline runs.; * Added support for new WDL functions:; * `length: (Array[X]) => Integer` - report the length of the specified array; * `prefix: (String, Array[X]) => Array[String]` - generate an array consisting of each element of the input array prefixed; by a specified `String`. The input array can have elements of any primitive type, the return array will always have; type `Array[String]`.; * `defined: (Any) => Boolean` - Will return false if the provided value is an optional that is not defined. Returns true in all oth

Spark backend was not widely used and it was decided to remove it from the codebase in order to narrow the scope of Cromwell code. . ### Improved DRS Localizer logging. Error logging while localizing a DRS URI should now be more clear especially when there is a Requester Pays bucket involved. ### Per-backend hog factors; Cromwell now allows overriding system-level log factors on back-end level. First, Cromwell will try to use hog-factor ; defined in the backend config, and if it is not defined, it will default to using system-wide hog factor.; ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; hog-factor: 2; }; }; }; }; ```; For more information about hog factors please see [this page](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/cromwell_features/HogFactors/). ### `martha_v2` Support Removed.

More info [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/). ### Call caching database refactoring. Cromwell's `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` primary key has been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 100,000 `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY`; rows per second. In deployments with millions or billions of `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` rows the migration may require ; a significant amount of downtime so please plan accordingly. The following SQL could be used to estimate the number of; rows in this table:. ```; select max(CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY_ID) from CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY; ```. ### Stackdriver Instrumentation. Cromwell now supports sending metrics to [Google's Stackdriver API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/). ; Learn more on how to configure [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Instrumentation/). ### BigQuery in PAPI.

Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: ## 43 Release Notes. ### Virtual Private Cloud with Subnetworks. Cromwell now allows PAPIV2 jobs to run on a specific subnetwork inside a private network by adding the subnetwork key ; `subnetwork-label-key` inside `virtual-private-cloud` in backend configuration. More info [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/). ### Call caching database refactoring. Cromwell's `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` primary key has been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 100,000 `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY`; rows per second. In deployments with millions or billions of `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` rows the migration may require ; a significant amount of downtime so please plan accordingly. The following SQL could be used to estimate the number of; rows in this table:. ```; select max(CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY_ID) from CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY; ```. ### Stackdriver Instrumentation. Cromwell now supports sending metrics to [Google's Stackdriver API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/). ; Learn more on how to configure [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Instrumentation/). ### BigQuery in PAPI. Cromwell now allows a user to specify BigQuery jobs when using the PAPIv2 backend. ### Configuration Changes. #### StatsD Instrumentation. There is a small change in StatsD's configuration path. Originally, the path to the config was `services.Instrumentation.config.statsd`; which now has been updated to `services.Instrumentation.config`. More info on its configuration can be found; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Instrumentation/). #### cached-copy. A new experimental feature, the `cached-copy` localization strategy is available for the shared filesystem. ; More information can be found in the [doc

The primary keys of Cromwell's job store tables have been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 40,000 `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY`; rows per second.
