Availability," should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_accuracy level | hash buffer number | buffer size | memory usage | speed | |; |- | - | - | - | - | - |; | 1 | 1 | 1G | 1G | ultra-fast | default for no-dedup mode |; | 2 | 1 | 2G | 2G | fast | |; | 3 | 2 | 2G | 4G | fast | default for dedup|; | 4 | 2 | 4G | 8G | fast | |; | 5 | 2 | 8G | 12G | fast | |; | 6 | 3 | 8G | 24G | moderate | |. ## deduplication; Since `v0.22.0`, fastp supports deduplication for FASTQ data. Specify `-D` or `--dedup` to enable this option. When `--dedup` is enabled, the `dup_calc_accuracy` level is default to `3`, and it can be changed to any value of 1 ~ 6. # all options; ```shell; usage: fastp -i <in1> -o <out1> [-I <in1> -O <out2>] ",down,MatchSource.DOCS,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md:28608,downstream,28608,README.md,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md,1,['down'],['downstream'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6).

If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ```. The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one. The sequence distribution of trimmed adapters can be found at the HTML/JSON reports. # per read cutting by quality score; `fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window. From `v0.19.6`, `fastp` supports 3 different operations, and you enable one or all of them:; * `-5, --cut_front` move a sliding window from front (5') to tail, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The leading N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_front_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_front_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `LEADING` method.; * `-3, --cut_tail`

Content: ce the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ```. The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one. The sequence distribution of trimmed adapters can be found at the HTML/JSON reports. # per read cutting by quality score; `fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window.

Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: default, and you can enable it by `-y` or `--low_complexity_filter`. The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]). For example:; ```; # a 51-bp sequence, with 3 bases that is different from its next base; seq = 'AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCCCC'; complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%; ```; The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly clea

Content: he percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]). For example:; ```; # a 51-bp sequence, with 3 bases that is different from its next base; seq = 'AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCCCC'; complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%; ```; The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The m

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: dely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ```. The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one. The sequence distribution of trimmed adapters can be found at the HTML/JSON reports. # per read cutting by quality score; `fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window. From `v0.19.6`, `fastp` supports 3 different operations, and you enable one or all of them:; * `-5, --cut_front` move a sliding window from front (5') to tail, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The leading N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_front_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_front_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `LEADING` method.; * `-3, --cut_tail`

Quality Attribute: Modifiability

Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

Performance,"ng of FASTQ files (i.e. alignment in parallel), `fastp` supports splitting the output into multiple files. The splitting can work with two different modes: `by limiting file number` or `by limiting lines of each file`. These two modes cannot be enabled together.  . The file names of these split files will have a sequential number prefix, adding to the original file name specified by `--out1` or `--out2`, and the width of the prefix is controlled by the `-d` or `--split_prefix_digits` option. For example, `--split_prefix_digits=4`, `--out1=out.fq`, `--split=3`, then the output files will be `0001.out.fq`,`0002.out.fq`,`0003.out.fq`. ## splitting by limiting file number; Use `-s` or `--split` to specify how many files you want to have. `fastp` evaluates the read number of a FASTQ by reading its first ~1M reads. This evaluation is not accurate so the file sizes of the last several files can be a little differnt (a bit bigger or smaller). For best performance, it is suggested to specify the file number to be a multiple of the thread number. ## splitting by limiting the lines of each file; Use `-S` or `--split_by_lines` to limit the lines of each file. The last files may have smaller sizes since usually the input file cannot be perfectly divided. The actual file lines may be a little greater than the value specified by `--split_by_lines` since `fastp` reads and writes data by blocks (a block = 1000 reads). # overrepresented sequence analysis; Overrepresented sequence analysis is disabled by default, you can specify `-p` or `--overrepresentation_analysis` to enable it.
