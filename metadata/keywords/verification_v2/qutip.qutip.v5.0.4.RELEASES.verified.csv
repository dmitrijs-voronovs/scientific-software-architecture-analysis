([#1594](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1594) by Johannes Feist); - Added the missing drift Hamiltonian to the method run_analytically of ``Processor``. ([#1603](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1603) Boxi Li); - The ``hadamard_transform`` was made much faster, e.g., ~70x faster for N=10. ([#1688](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1688) by Asier Galicia); - Added support for computing the power of a scalar-like Qobj. ([#1692](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1692) by Asier Galicia); - Removed the ``hardware_info`` module. This module wasn't used inside QuTiP and regularly broke when new operating systems were released, and in particular prevented importing QuTiP on the Apple M1.

Content: nes and arcs on the Bloch sphere. ([#1690](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1690) by Gaurav Saxena, Asier Galicia and Simon Cross); - Added transparency parameter to the add_point, add_vector and add_states methods in the Bloch and Bloch3d classes. ([#1837](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1837) by Xavier Spronken); - Support ``Path`` objects in ``qutip.fileio``. ([#1813](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1813) by Adrià Labay); - Improved the weighting in steadystate solver, so that the default weight matches the documented behaviour and the dense solver applies the weights in the same manner as the sparse solver. ([#1275](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1275) and [#1802](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1802) by NS2 Group at LPS and Simon Cross); - Added a ``color_style`` option to the ``hinton`` plotting function. ([#1595](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1595) by Cassandra Granade); - Improved the scaling of ``floquet_master_equation_rates`` and ``floquet_master_equation_tensor`` and fixed transposition and basis change errors in ``floquet_master_equation_tensor`` and ``floquet_markov_mesolve``. ([#1248](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1248) by Camille Le Calonnec, Jake Lishman and Eric Giguère); - Removed ``linspace_with`` and ``view_methods`` from ``qutip.utilities``.

Some widely useful gates have been retained in ``qutip.gates``.; - ``qutip.control`` has been moved to qutip-qtrl and once installed qutip-qtrl is available as either ``qutip.control`` or ``qutip_qtrl``. Note that ``quitp_qtrl`` is provided primarily for backwards compatibility. Improvements to optimal control will take place in the new ``qutip_qoc`` package.; - ``qutip.lattice`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-lattice. It is available from `<https://github.com/qutip/qutip-lattice>`.; - ``qutip.sparse`` has been removed. It contained the old sparse matrix representation and is replaced by the new implementation in ``qutip.data``.; - ``qutip.piqs`` functions are no longer available from the ``qutip`` namespace. They are accessible from ``qutip.piqs`` instead. ## Miscellaneous. - Support has been added for 64-bit integer sparse matrix indices, allowing; sparse matrices with up to 2**63 rows and columns. This support needs to; be enabled at compilation time by calling ``setup.py`` and passing; ``--with-idxint-64``. ### Feature removals. - Support for OpenMP has been removed. If there is enough demand and a good plan for how to organize it, OpenMP support may return in a future QuTiP release.; - The ``qutip.parfor`` function has been removed. Use ``qutip.parallel_map`` instead.; - ``qutip.graph`` has been removed and replaced by SciPy's graph functions.; - ``qutip.topology`` has been removed. It contained only one function

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content:  using CVXPy 1.1 with sparse matrices. (by **Felipe Bivort Haiek**); - Fix segfaults in ``mesolve`` when passed a bad initial ``Qobj`` as the state. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Fix sparse matrix construction in PIQS when using Scipy 1.6.1. (by **Drew Parsons**); - Fix ``zspmv_openmp.cpp`` missing from the pip sdist. (by **Christoph Gohlke**); - Fix correlation functions throwing away imaginary components. (by **Asier Galicia Martinez**); - Fix ``QubitCircuit.add_circuit()`` for SWAP gate. (by **Canoming**); - Fix the broken LaTeX image conversion. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Fix gate resolution of the FREDKIN gate. (by **Bo Yang**); - Fix broken formatting in docstrings. (by **Jake Lishman**). Deprecations; ------------; - ``eseries``, ``essolve`` and ``ode2es`` are all deprecated, pending removal in QuTiP 5.0. These are legacy functions and classes that have been left unmaintained for a long time, and their functionality is now better achieved with ``QobjEvo`` or ``mesolve``. Developer Changes; -----------------; - **MAJOR** Overhaul of setup and packaging code to make it satisfy PEP 517, and move the build to a matrix on GitHub Actions in order to release binary wheels on pip for all major platforms and supported Python versions. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Default arguments in ``Qobj`` are now ``None`` rather than mutable types. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Fixed comsumable iterators being used to parametrise some tests, preventing the testing suite from being re-run within the same session. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Remove unused imports, simplify some floats and remove unnecessary list conversions. (by **jakobjakobson13**); - Improve Travis jobs matrix for specifying the testing containers. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Fix coverage reporting on Travis. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Added a ``pyproject.toml`` file. (by **Simon Humpohl** and **Eric Giguère**); - Add doctests to documentation. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Fix all warnings in the documentation build. (by **Jake Lishman**)

Content: e influence martingale is available through the ``.trace`` attribute of the result. ### Stochastic Equation Solvers (ssesolve, smesolve). - Function call greatly changed: many keyword arguments are now options.; - m_ops and dW_factors are now changed from the default from the new class interface only.; - Use the same parallel maps as mcsolve: support for loky and mpi map added.; - End conditions ``timeout`` and ``target_tol`` added.; - The ``seed`` parameter now supports supplying numpy ``SeedSequence``.; - Wiener function is now available as a feedback. ### Bloch-Redfield Master Equation Solver (brmesolve):. - The ``a_ops`` and ``spectra`` support implementations been heavily reworked to; reuse the techniques from the new Coefficient and QobjEvo classes.; - The ``use_secular`` parameter has been removed. Use ``sec_cutoff=-1`` instead.; - The required tolerance is now read from ``qutip.settings``. ### Krylov Subspace Solver (krylovsolve):. - The Krylov solver is now implemented using ``SESolver`` and the ``krylov``; ODE integrator. The function ``krylovsolve`` is maintained for convenience; and now supports many more options.; - The ``sparse`` parameter has been removed. Supply a sparse ``Qobj`` for the; Hamiltonian instead. ### Floquet Solver (fsesolve and fmmesolve):. - The Floquet solver has been rewritten to use a new ``FloquetBasis`` class; which manages the transformations from lab to Floquet basis and back.; - Many of the internal methods used by the old Floquet solvers have; been removed. The Floquet tensor may still be retried using; the function ``floquet_tensor``.; - The Floquet Markov Master Equation solver has had many changes and; new options added. The environment temperature may be specified using; ``w_th``, and the result states are stored in the lab basis and optionally; in the Floquet basis using ``store_floquet_state``.; - The spectra functions supplied to ``fmmesolve`` must now be vectorized; (i.e. accept and return numpy arrays for frequencies

Energy Efficiency," improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content:  improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible.

Integrability,"This release brings improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible. (by **Boxi Li**); - **MAJOR** Improved qubit circuit simulators, including OpenQASM support and performance optimisations. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: This release brings improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible. (by **Boxi Li**); - **MAJOR** Improved qubit circuit simulators, including OpenQASM support and performance optimisations. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits. (by **Boxi Li**); - Refactor ``QubitCircuit.resolve_gate()`` (by

Modifiability,"# QuTiP 5.0.0 . QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``,; ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations,; and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used; consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been; substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to; represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer; and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced.; In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators``; specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have; had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to; easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know.; A notebook to help with migration is available on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18TcuHNQifYSHdGey7otK8IPDB1YbDZpW?usp=sharing). . An extensive list of changes follows. ## Contributors. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years.

Content: # QuTiP 5.0.0 . QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``,; ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations,; and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used; consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been; substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to; represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer; and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced.; In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators``; specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have; had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to; easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know.; A notebook to help with migration is available on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18TcuHNQifYSHdGey7otK8IPDB1YbDZpW?usp=sharing). .

Some widely useful gates have been retained in ``qutip.gates``.; - ``qutip.control`` has been moved to qutip-qtrl and once installed qutip-qtrl is available as either ``qutip.control`` or ``qutip_qtrl``. Note that ``quitp_qtrl`` is provided primarily for backwards compatibility. Improvements to optimal control will take place in the new ``qutip_qoc`` package.; - ``qutip.lattice`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-lattice. It is available from `<https://github.com/qutip/qutip-lattice>`.; - ``qutip.sparse`` has been removed. It contained the old sparse matrix representation and is replaced by the new implementation in ``qutip.data``.; - ``qutip.piqs`` functions are no longer available from the ``qutip`` namespace. They are accessible from ``qutip.piqs`` instead. ## Miscellaneous. - Support has been added for 64-bit integer sparse matrix indices, allowing; sparse matrices with up to 2**63 rows and columns. This support needs to; be enabled at compilation time by calling ``setup.py`` and passing; ``--with-idxint-64``. ### Feature removals. - Support for OpenMP has been removed. If there is enough demand and a good plan for how to organize it, OpenMP support may return in a future QuTiP release.; - The ``qutip.parfor`` function has been removed. Use ``qutip.parallel_map`` instead.; - ``qutip.graph`` has been removed and replaced by SciPy's graph functions.; - ``qutip.topology`` has been removed.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: anization. - ``qutip.qip`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-qip. Once installed, qutip-qip is available as either ``qutip.qip`` or ``qutip_qip``. Some widely useful gates have been retained in ``qutip.gates``.; - ``qutip.control`` has been moved to qutip-qtrl and once installed qutip-qtrl is available as either ``qutip.control`` or ``qutip_qtrl``. Note that ``quitp_qtrl`` is provided primarily for backwards compatibility. Improvements to optimal control will take place in the new ``qutip_qoc`` package.; - ``qutip.lattice`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-lattice. It is available from `<https://github.com/qutip/qutip-lattice>`.; - ``qutip.sparse`` has been removed. It contained the old sparse matrix representation and is replaced by the new implementation in ``qutip.data``.; - ``qutip.piqs`` functions are no longer available from the ``qutip`` namespace. They are accessible from ``qutip.piqs`` instead. ## Miscellaneous. - Support has been added for 64-bit integer sparse matrix indices, allowing; sparse matrices with up to 2**63 rows and columns. This support needs to; be enabled at compilation time by calling ``setup.py`` and passing; ``--with-idxint-64``. ### Feature removals. - Support for OpenMP has been removed. If there is enough demand and a good plan for how to organize it, OpenMP support may return in a future QuTiP release.; - The ``qutip.parfor`` function has been removed. Use ``qutip.parallel_map`` instead.; - ``qutip.graph`` has been removed and replaced by SciPy's graph functions.; - ``qutip.topology`` has been removed. It contained only one function ``berry_curvature``.; - The ``~/.qutip/qutiprc`` config file is no longer supported. It contained settings for the OpenMP support.; - Deprecate ``three_level_atom``; - Deprecate ``orbital``. ## Changes from QuTiP 5.0.0b1:. ### Features. - Add dtype to printed ouput of qobj (#2352 by Rochisha Agarwal). ### Miscellaneous. - Allow scipy 1.12 to be used with qutip.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: ol.optimize_pulse support for sparse eigenvector decomposition with the Qobj oper_dtype (the Qobj oper_dtype is the default for large systems). ([#1621](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1621) by Simon Cross); - Removed qutip.control.optimize_pulse support for scipy.sparse.csr_matrix and generic ndarray-like matrices. Support for these was non-functional. ([#1621](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1621) by Simon Cross); - Fixed errors in the calculation of the Husimi spin_q_function and spin_wigner functions and added tests for them. ([#1632](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1632) by Mark Johnson); - Fixed setting of OpenMP compilation flag on Linux. Previously when compiling the OpenMP functions were compiled without parallelization. ([#1693](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1693) by Eric Giguère); - Fixed tracking the state of the Bloch sphere figure and axes to prevent exceptions during rendering. ([#1619](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1619) by Simon Cross); - Fixed compatibility with numpy configuration in numpy's 1.22.0 release. ([#1752](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1752) by Matthew Treinish); - Added dims checks for e_ops passed to solvers to prevent hanging the calling process when e_ops of the wrong dimensions were passed. ([#1778](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1778) by Eric Giguère); - Added a check in Qobj constructor that the respective members of data.shape cannot be larger than what the corresponding dims could contain to prevent a segmentation fault caused by inconsistencies between dims and shapes.

Testability,"`` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``. Other members of the QuTiP Admin team have been heavily involved in reviewing, testing and designing QuTiP 5:. - Alexander Pitchford; - Asier Galicia; - Nathan Shammah; - Shahnawaz Ahmed; - Neill Lambert; - Simon Cross.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: `` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: erlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix.; The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``,; regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other; operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type; to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and; ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype``; parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product.; ``bar @ ket`` returns a scalar.; - The new ``.contract()`` method will collapse 1D subspaces of the dimensions of; the ``Qobj``.; - The new ``.logm()`` method returns the matrix logarithm of an operator.; - The methods ``.set_data``, ``.get_data``, ``.extract_state``, ``.eliminate_states``,; ``.evaluate`` and ``.check_isunitary`` have been removed.; - The property ``dtype`` return the representation of the data used.; - The new ``data_as`` allow to obtain the data as a common python formats:; numpy array, scipy sparse matrix, JAX Array, etc. ## QobjEvo changes. The ``QobjEvo`` type for storing time-dependent quantum objects has been; significantly expanded, standardized and extended. The time-dependent; coefficients are now represented using a new ``Coefficient`` type that; may be independently created and manipulated if required. Some highlights:. - The ``.compile()`` method has been removed. Coefficients specified as; strings are automatically compiled if possible and the compilation is; cached across different Python runs and instances.; - Mixing coefficient types within a single ``Qobj`` is now supported.; - Many new attributes were added to ``QobjEvo
