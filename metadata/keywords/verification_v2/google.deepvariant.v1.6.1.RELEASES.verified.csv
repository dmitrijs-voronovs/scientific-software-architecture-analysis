Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: * New model datatype: `--model_type ONT_R104` is a new option. Starting from v1.5, DeepVariant natively supports ONT R10.4 simplex and duplex data.; * For older ONT chemistry, please continue to use [PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant](https://github.com/kishwarshafin/pepper).; * Incorporated PacBio Revio training data in DeepVariant PacBio model. In our evaluations this single model performs well on both Sequel II and Revio datatypes. Please use DeepVariant v1.5 and later for Revio data. ; * Incorporated Element Biosciences data in WGS models. We found that we could jointly train a short-read WGS model with both Illumina and Element data. Inclusion of Element data improves accuracy on Element without negative effect on Illumina.

Updated htslib version to 1.13.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Output your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""
}

Usability,"This release has a new WGS model that has major accuracy improvement on PCR+ data. We also released a new WES model that has some minor accuracy improvement. A few important changes in this release:; 1. Changes in the training data for the WGS model:; * Addition:; * 3 replicates of HG001 (PCR+, HiSeqX) provided by DNAnexus; * 2 replicates of HG001 (PCR+, NovaSeq) from BaseSpace public data.; * Removal:; * WES data; (In v0.5.0, we trained our WGS model with WGS+WES data. This time we found that it didn’t help with WGS accuracy, so we removed them); 1. Improved training data labels. See [haplotype_labeler.py](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/r0.6/deepvariant/labeler/haplotype_labeler.py); 1. For direct inputs/outputs from cloud storage, we no longer support direct file I/O (like gs://deepvariant) due to bugs in htslib. Instead we recommend using gcsfuse to read/write data directly on GCS buckets.
