State vectors, or density matrices, as well as col_times and col_which, are accessed in a similar manner, although typically one does not need an index (i.e [0]) since there is only one list for each of these components. The one exception to this rule is if you choose to output state vectors from the Monte Carlo solver, in which case there are ntraj number of state vector arrays. Saving and Loading Result Objects¶; The main advantage in using the Result class as a data storage object comes from the simplicity in which simulation data can be stored and later retrieved. The qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions are designed for this task. To begin, let us save the data object from the previous section into a file called “cavity+qubit-data” in the current working directory by calling:; >>> qsave(result, 'cavity+qubit-data'). All of the data results are then stored in a single file of the same name with a “.qu” extension. Therefore, everything needed to later this data is stored in a single file. Loading the file is just as easy as saving:; >>> stored_result = qload('cavity+qubit-data'); Loaded Result object:; Result object with mcsolve data.; ---------------------------------; expect = True; num_expect = 2, num_collapse = 2, ntraj = 500. where stored_result is the new name of the Result object.

State vectors, or density matrices, as well as col_times and col_which, are accessed in a similar manner, although typically one does not need an index (i.e [0]) since there is only one list for each of these components. The one exception to this rule is if you choose to output state vectors from the Monte Carlo solver, in which case there are ntraj number of state vector arrays. Saving and Loading Result Objects¶; The main advantage in using the Result class as a data storage object comes from the simplicity in which simulation data can be stored and later retrieved. The qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions are designed for this task. To begin, let us save the data object from the previous section into a file called “cavity+qubit-data” in the current working directory by calling:; >>> qsave(result, 'cavity+qubit-data'). All of the data results are then stored in a single file of the same name with a “.qu” extension. Therefore, everything needed to later this data is stored in a single file. Loading the file is just as easy as saving:; >>> stored_result = qload('cavity+qubit-data'); Loaded Result object:; Result object with mcsolve data.; ---------------------------------; expect = True; num_expect = 2, num_collapse = 2, ntraj = 500. where stored_result is the new name of the Result object. We can then extract the data and plot in the same manner as before:; expt0 = stored_result.expect[0]; expt1 = stored_result.expect[1]; times = stored_result.times; plot(times, expt0, times, expt1); show(). Also see Saving QuTiP Objects and Data Sets for more information on saving quantum objects, as well as arrays for use in other programs. Next ; Previous. © Copyright 2011 and later, P.D. Nation, J.R.

Optional Installation Options¶. UMFPACK Linear Solver¶; As of SciPy 0.14+, the umfpack linear solver routines for solving large-scale sparse linear systems have been replaced due to licensing restrictions. The default method for all sparse linear problems is now the SuperLU library. However, scipy still includes the ability to call the umfpack library via the scikits.umfpack module. In our experience, the umfpack solver is 2-5x faster than the SuperLU routines, which is a very noticeable performance increase when used for solving steady state solutions. We have an updated scikits.umfpack module available at http://github.com/nonhermitian/umfpack that can be installed to have SciPy find and use the umfpack library. Optimized BLAS Libraries¶; QuTiP is designed to take advantage of some of the optimized BLAS libraries that are available for NumPy. At present, this includes the OPENBLAS and MKL libraries. If NumPy is built against these libraries, then QuTiP will take advantage of the performance gained by using these optimized tools. As these libraries are multi-threaded, you can change the number of threads used in these packages by adding:; >>> import os; >>> os.environ['OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'; >>> os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'. at the top of your Python script files, or iPython notebooks, and then loading the QuTiP framework. If these commands are not present, then QuTiP automatically sets the number of threads to one. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library.

The default method for all sparse linear problems is now the SuperLU library. However, scipy still includes the ability to call the umfpack library via the scikits.umfpack module. In our experience, the umfpack solver is 2-5x faster than the SuperLU routines, which is a very noticeable performance increase when used for solving steady state solutions. We have an updated scikits.umfpack module available at http://github.com/nonhermitian/umfpack that can be installed to have SciPy find and use the umfpack library. Optimized BLAS Libraries¶; QuTiP is designed to take advantage of some of the optimized BLAS libraries that are available for NumPy. At present, this includes the OPENBLAS and MKL libraries. If NumPy is built against these libraries, then QuTiP will take advantage of the performance gained by using these optimized tools. As these libraries are multi-threaded, you can change the number of threads used in these packages by adding:; >>> import os; >>> os.environ['OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'; >>> os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'. at the top of your Python script files, or iPython notebooks, and then loading the QuTiP framework. If these commands are not present, then QuTiP automatically sets the number of threads to one. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing Q

Preamble¶; This document covers the process for managing updates to the current minor release and making new releases.; Within this document, the git remote upstream refers to the main QuTiP organsiation repository, and origin refers to your personal fork.; In short, the steps you need to take are:. Prepare the release branch (see git).; Run the “Build wheels, optionally deploy to PyPI” GitHub action to build binary and source packages and upload them to PyPI (see deploy).; Retrieve the built documentation from GitHub (see docbuild).; Create a GitHub release and uploaded the built files to it (see github).; Update qutip.org with the new links and documentation (web).; Update the conda feedstock, deploying the package to conda (cforge). Setting Up The Release Branch¶; In this step you will prepare a git branch on the main QuTiP repository that has the state of the code that is going to be released.; This procedure is quite different if you are releasing a new minor or major version compared to if you are making a bugfix patch release.; For a new minor or major version, do update-changelog and then jump to release.; For a bug fix to an existing release, do update-changelog and then jump to bugfix.; Changes that are not backwards-compatible may only be made in a major release.; New features that do not affect backwards-compatibility can be made in a minor release.; Bug fix releases should be small, only fix bugs, and not introduce any new features.; There are a few steps that should have been kept up-to-date during day-to-day development, but might not

This will include a study of existing; libraries, such as qiskit.pulse and OpenPulse 1, comparing them with; qutip.qip.pulse module and building a more general and comprehensive; description of the pulse.; More examples of quantum system in the qutip.qip.device module. The circuit; simulation and compilation depend strongly on the physical system. At the; moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to; include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system 2,; Ion trap system 3 or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of; control Hamiltonian and a compiler that finds the control pulse of a quantum; gate. More involved noise models can also be added based on the physical; system. This part is going to involve some physics and study of commonly used; hardware platforms. The related code can be found in qutip.qip.device and; qutip.qip.compiler. Skills¶.

This will attempt to load up OpenMP libraries during the compilation process, which depends on you having suitable C++ compiler and library support.; If you are on Linux this is probably already done, but the compiler macOS ships with does not have OpenMP support.; You will likely need to refer to external operating-system-specific guides for more detail here, as it may be very non-trivial to correctly configure.; If you wish to contribute to the QuTiP project, then you will want to create your own fork of the QuTiP git repository, clone this to a local folder, and install it into your Python environment using:; python setup.py develop. When you do import qutip in this environment, you will then load the code from your local fork, enabling you to edit the Python files and have the changes immediately available when you restart your Python interpreter, without n

Using GitHub, make a pull request to the release branch (e.g. qutip-4.7.X) using this branch that you just created.; You will need to change the “base branch” in the pull request, because GitHub will always try to make the PR against master at first.; When the tests have passed, merge this in.; Finally, back on master, make a new pull request that changes the VERSION file to be <next-expected-version>.dev, for example 4.8.0.dev.; The “Development Status” in setup.cfg on master should not have changed, and should be; Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha. because master is never directly released. You should now have a branch that you can see on the GitHub website that is called qutip-4.7.X (or whatever minor version), and the state of the code in it should be exactly what you want to release as the new minor release.; If you notice you have made a mistake, you can make additional pull requests to the release branch to fix it.; master should look pretty similar, except the VERSION will be higher and have a .dev suffix, and the “Development Status” in setup.cfg will be different.; You are now ready to actually perform the release.; Go to deploy. Create a Bug Fix Release¶; In this you will modify an already-released branch by “cherry-picking” one or more pull requests that have been merged to master (including your new changelog), and bump the “patch” part of the version number. On your machine, make sure your copy of master is up-to-date (git checkout master; git pull upstream master).; In particular, make sure the changelog you wrote in the first step is vi

Deployability,"forge is below defaults in the channels list. Installing via pip¶; For other types of installation, it is often easiest to use the Python package manager pip.; pip install qutip. Or, optionally, to also include the Fortran-based Monte Carlo solver:; pip install qutip --install-option=--with-f90mc. More detailed platform-dependent installation alternatives are given below. Installing from Source¶; Official releases of QuTiP are available from the download section on the project’s web pages. http://www.qutip.org/download.html; and the latest source code is available in our Github repository. http://github.com/qutip; In general we recommend users to use the latest stable release of QuTiP, but if you are interested in helping us out with development or wish to submit bug fixes, then use the latest development version from the Github repository.; Installing QuTiP from source requires that all the dependencies are satisfied. To install QuTiP from the source code run:; sudo python setup.py install. To also include the optional Fortran Monte Carlo solver, run:; sudo python setup.py install --with-f90mc. On Windows, omit sudo from the commands given above. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; import qutip.testing as qt; qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: forge is below defaults in the channels list. Installing via pip¶; For other types of installation, it is often easiest to use the Python package manager pip.; pip install qutip. Or, optionally, to also include the Fortran-based Monte Carlo solver:; pip install qutip --install-option=--with-f90mc. More detailed platform-dependent installation alternatives are given below. Installing from Source¶; Official releases of QuTiP are available from the download section on the project’s web pages. http://www.qutip.org/download.html; and the latest source code is available in our Github repository. http://github.com/qutip; In general we recommend users to use the latest stable release of QuTiP, but if you are interested in helping us out with development or wish to submit bug fixes, then use the latest development version from the Github repository.; Installing QuTiP from source requires that all the dependencies are satisfied. To install QuTiP from the source code run:; sudo python setup.py install. To also include the optional Fortran Monte Carlo solver, run:; sudo python setup.py install --with-f90mc. On Windows, omit sudo from the commands given above. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; import qutip.testing as qt; qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules. See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the QuTiP Discussion Board and post a message detailing your particular issue. Checking Version Information using the About Function¶; QuTiP includes an “about” function for viewing inform

Content: g_utils,; in decreasing levels of messaging, are:; DEBUG_INTENSE, DEBUG_VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL; Anything WARN or above is effectively ‘quiet’ execution,; assuming everything runs as expected.; The default NOTSET implies that the level will be taken from; the QuTiP settings file, which by default is WARN. evo_comp_summaryEvoCompSummaryA summary of the most recent evolution computation; Used in the stats and dump; Will be set to None if neither stats or dump are set. apply_params(params=None)[source]¶; Set object attributes based on the dictionary (if any) passed in the; instantiation, or passed as a parameter; This is called during the instantiation automatically.; The key value pairs are the attribute name and value; Note: attributes are created if they do not exist already,; and are overwritten if they do. dump_current()[source]¶; Store a copy of the current time evolution. class TSlotCompUpdateAll(dynamics, params=None)[source]¶; Timeslot Computer - Update All; Updates all dynamics generators, propagators and evolutions when; ctrl amplitudes are updated. compare_amps(new_amps)[source]¶; Determine if any amplitudes have changed. If so, then mark the; timeslots as needing recalculation; Returns: True if amplitudes are the same, False if they have changed. get_timeslot_for_fidelity_calc()[source]¶; Returns the timeslot index that will be used calculate current fidelity; value.; This (default) method simply returns the last timeslot. recompute_evolution()[source]¶; Recalculates the evolution operators.; Dynamics generators (e.g. Hamiltonian) and; prop (propagators) are calculated as necessary. class PulseGen(dyn=None, params=None)[source]¶; Pulse generator; Base class for all Pulse generators; The object can optionally be instantiated with a Dynamics object,; in which case the timeslots and amplitude scaling and offset; are copied from that.; Otherwise the class can be used independently by setting:; tau (array of timeslot durations); or; num_tslot

You should now have a branch that you can see on the GitHub website that is called qutip-4.7.X (or whatever minor version), and the state of the code in it should be exactly what you want to release as the new minor release.; If you notice you have made a mistake, you can make additional pull requests to the release branch to fix it.; master should look pretty similar, except the VERSION will be higher and have a .dev suffix, and the “Development Status” in setup.cfg will be different.; You are now ready to actually perform the release.; Go to deploy. Create a Bug Fix Release¶; In this you will modify an already-released branch by “cherry-picking” one or more pull requests that have been merged to master (including your new changelog), and bump the “patch” part of the version number. On your machine, make sure your copy of master is up-to-date (git checkout master; git pull upstream master).; In particular, make sure the changelog you wrote in the first step is visible.; Find the branch of the release that you will be modifying.; This should already exist on the qutip/qutip repository, and be called qutip-<major>.<minor>.X (e.g. qutip-4.6.X).; If you cannot see it, run git fetch upstream to update all the branch references from the main repository.; Checkout a

To also include the optional Fortran Monte Carlo solver, run:; sudo python setup.py install --with-f90mc. On Windows, omit sudo from the commands given above. Installation on Ubuntu Linux¶. Using QuTiP’s PPA¶; The easiest way to install QuTiP in Ubuntu (14.04 and later) is to use the QuTiP PPA; sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jrjohansson/qutip-releases; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install python-qutip. A Python 3 version is also available, and can be installed using:; sudo apt-get install python3-qutip. With this method the most important dependencies are installed automatically, and when a new version of QuTiP is released it can be upgraded through the standard package management system. In addition to the required dependencies, it is also strongly recommended that you install the texlive-latex-extra package:",install,MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/installation.html:4345,installation,4345,docs/3.0.1/installation.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/installation.html,1,['install'],['installation'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Content: he Linux and OS X platforms. Platform-independent installation¶; Often the easiest way is to install QuTiP is to use the Python package manager pip.; sudo pip install qutip. However, when installing QuTiP this way the Fortran-based Monte Carlo solver is not included.; More detailed platform-dependent installation alternatives are given below. Get the source code¶; Official releases of QuTiP are available from the download section on the project’s web pages. http://www.qutip.org/download.html; and the latest source code is available in our Github repository. http://github.com/qutip; In general we recommend users to use the latest stable release of QuTiP, but if you are interested in helping us out with development or wish to submit bug fixes, then use the latest development version from the Github repository.

We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\
