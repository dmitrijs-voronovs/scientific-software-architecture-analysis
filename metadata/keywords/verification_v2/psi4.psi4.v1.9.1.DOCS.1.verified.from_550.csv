R = 1.075; A = 133.93; }. set reference uhf; set guess gwh; set basis cc-pvdz; set e_convergence 8. # Override the default value of omega; set dft_omega 2.0. E = energy('wb97x'). # Revoke the change for later computations if needed; revoke_global_option_changed('DFT_OMEGA'). This feature would be useful after finishing the IP fitting procedure, for example.

Deployability,"teration is completed by performing the orbital transformation of the; integrals. As in the simultaneous algorithm, the DIIS; extrapolation is used to accelerate convergence. Two-step algorithm is; only available for the DC-06 and DC-12 methods. QC; In the quadratically-convergent algorithm, the; orbital and cumulant update equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson; method. Each macroiteration of the quadratically-convergent algorithm consists; of a single Newton-Raphson update followed by the orbital transformation; of the integrals. The solution of the Newton-Raphson equations is performed; iteratively using the preconditioned conjugate gradients method, where only the; product of the electronic Hessian with the step vector is computed for; efficiency. By default, the electronic Hessian is build for both the cumulant and orbital; updates and both updates are performed simultaneously. Setting the |dct__qc_type|; option to ``TWOSTEP`` will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,; while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.; If requested by the user (set |dct__qc_coupling| to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include; matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.; The computation of these coupling elements increases; the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is; recommended for open-shell systems.; It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully; optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or; the orbital gradient is below :math:`10^{-7}`. The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive :math:`{\cal O}(N^5)` integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive :math:`{\cal O}(N^6)`; cumulant updates.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: teration is completed by performing the orbital transformation of the; integrals. As in the simultaneous algorithm, the DIIS; extrapolation is used to accelerate convergence. Two-step algorithm is; only available for the DC-06 and DC-12 methods. QC; In the quadratically-convergent algorithm, the; orbital and cumulant update equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson; method. Each macroiteration of the quadratically-convergent algorithm consists; of a single Newton-Raphson update followed by the orbital transformation; of the integrals. The solution of the Newton-Raphson equations is performed; iteratively using the preconditioned conjugate gradients method, where only the; product of the electronic Hessian with the step vector is computed for; efficiency. By default, the electronic Hessian is build for both the cumulant and orbital; updates and both updates are performed simultaneously. Setting the |dct__qc_type|; option to ``TWOSTEP`` will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,; while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.; If requested by the user (set |dct__qc_coupling| to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include; matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.; The computation of these coupling elements increases; the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is; recommended for open-shell systems.; It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully; optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or; the orbital gradient is below :math:`10^{-7}`. The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive :math:`{\cal O}(N^5)` integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive :math:`{\cal O}(N^6)`; cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-

Set to installation directory containing ``share/cmake/CheMPS2/CheMPS2Config.cmake``; * :makevar:`CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_CheMPS2` |w---w| CMake variable to force internal build of CheMPS2 instead of detecting pre-built; * :makevar:`CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_CheMPS2` |w---w| CMake variable to force detecting pre-built CheMPS2 and not falling back on internal build. **Examples**. A. Build bundled. .. code-block:: bash. >>> cmake -DENABLE_CheMPS2=ON. B. Build *without* CheMPS2. .. code-block:: bash. >>> cmake. C. Build bundled with specific HDF5. .. code-block:: bash. >>> cmake -DENABLE_CheMPS2=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/hdf5. D.

Below are a few; clarifying examples. * uses :math:`10^{-7}` SCF conv crit since that's Cfour's default; for |cfour__cfour_scf_conv| ::. energy('c4-scf'). * uses :math:`10^{-6}` SCF conv crit since default overwritten by; keyword ::. set cfour_scf_conv 6; energy('c4-scf'). * uses :math:`10^{-5}` SCF conv crit since default overwritten by; :ref:`SCF module<apdx:scf>` keyword ::. set d_convergence 5; energy('c4-scf'). * uses :math:`10^{-6}` SCF conv crit since default overwritten by; :ref:`SCF module<apdx:scf>` keyword (local scope works, too) where; the |PSIfours| more flexible float input has been rounded down to; the integer required by Cfour ::. set scf d_convergence 5e-6; energy('c4-scf'). * uses :math:`10^{-6}` SCF conv crit since default overwritten; and Cfour module keyword trumps |PSIfour| SCF module keyword ::. set cfour_scf_conv 6; set d_convergence 8; energy('c4-scf'). The keyword translation feature is still in the proof-of-principle; stage, so only a handful (found here) of keywords participate. .. note:: Longtime Cfour users who may consider this keyword; translation a flaw rather than a feature can avoid it entirely by; confining keywords to the :ref:`Cfour module<apdx:cfour>` along with; |mints__basis| and |globals__puream| (opt, too?).

Functional Selection; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. |PSIfour| features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call::. energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; |scf__reference| option before the call to ``energy``::. set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by calling ``energy`` (or any driver function); with a ``dft_functional`` argument::. energy('scf', dft_functional = 'b3lyp'). Another alternative is providing a specially crafted `dict`-ionary to the ``dft_functional``; argument::. custom_functional = { ""name"": ""my_unique_name"", ... }; energy('scf', dft_functional = custom_functional). For further details about this so called `dict_func` syntax, see; :ref:`sec:dftdictbuilder`. For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; |scf__dft_alpha| option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree--Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the |scf__dft_omega| option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional. A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in |PSIfour|, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:. :ref:`All Functionals <table:dft_all>`; All functionals, including LSDA-only functionals. Note that here and; throughout, functionals which end in `_X` or `_C` are exchange or; correlation only, and should not be used for most production-level; computations.

Functional Selection; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. |PSIfour| features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call::. energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; |scf__reference| option before the call to ``energy``::. set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by calling ``energy`` (or any driver function); with a ``dft_functional`` argument::. energy('scf', dft_functional = 'b3lyp'). Another alternative is providing a specially crafted `dict`-ionary to the ``dft_functional``; argument::. custom_functional = { ""name"": ""my_unique_name"", ... }; energy('scf', dft_functional = custom_functional). For further details about this so called `dict_func` syntax, see; :ref:`sec:dftdictbuilder`. For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; |scf__dft_alpha| option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree--Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the |scf__dft_omega| option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional. A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in |PSIfour|, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:. :ref:`All Functionals <table:dft_all>`; All functionals, including LSDA-only functionals. Note that here and; throughout, functionals which end in `_X` or `_C` are exchange or; correlation only, and should not be used for most production-level; computations. Examples include `PBE_X` and `PBE_C`, which contain the; separate definitions of the PBE exchange and correlation holes. In most cases,; the unit

Convergence Stabilization; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. A summary of Psi's supported convergence stabilization techniques is presented below:. DIIS [On by Default]; DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via :term:`options <DIIS (SCF)>`.; ADIIS [On by Default]; ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting |scf__scf_initial_accelerator|. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT.; MOM [Off by Default]; MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals.

Convergence Stabilization; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. A summary of Psi's supported convergence stabilization techniques is presented below:. DIIS [On by Default]; DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via :term:`options <DIIS (SCF)>`.; ADIIS [On by Default]; ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting |scf__scf_initial_accelerator|. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT.; MOM [Off by Default]; MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is t

Energy Efficiency," reference to obtain a guess for the DCT orbitals. After SCF is; converged, the program will perform the energy computation using the ODC-12; method. By default, simultaneous algorithm will be used for the solution of; the equations. One can also request to perform geometry; optimization following example below::. molecule { ; H; H 1 1.0; }. set basis cc-pvdz; ; optimize('dct'). The ``optimize('dct')`` call will first perform all of the procedures; described above to obtain the ODC-12 energy. After that, the ODC-12 analytic; gradients code will be executed and geometry optimization will be performed. . .. _`sec:dctrecommend`:. Recommendations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Here is a list of recommendations for the DCT module:. * Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; |dct__ao_basis| ``DISK`` option is recommended (set by default). * In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the |dct__ao_basis| ``DISK`` option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content:  reference to obtain a guess for the DCT orbitals. After SCF is; converged, the program will perform the energy computation using the ODC-12; method. By default, simultaneous algorithm will be used for the solution of; the equations. One can also request to perform geometry; optimization following example below::. molecule { ; H; H 1 1.0; }. set basis cc-pvdz; ; optimize('dct'). The ``optimize('dct')`` call will first perform all of the procedures; described above to obtain the ODC-12 energy. After that, the ODC-12 analytic; gradients code will be executed and geometry optimization will be performed. . .. _`sec:dctrecommend`:. Recommendations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Here is a list of recommendations for the DCT module:. * Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; |dct__ao_basis| ``DISK`` option is recommended (set by default). * In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the |dct__ao_basis| ``DISK`` option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation. * In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; |dct__diis_start_convergence| option to the value greater than; :math:`10^{-3}` by one or two orders of magnitude (*e.g.* :math:`10^{-2}` or; :math:`10^{-1}`). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations. * If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm. * When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm for the closed-shell molecules, it; is recommended to set

Energy Efficiency,"%; % History of Psi; %; % Daniel Crawford, 24 January, 1996; %. The PSI suite of {\em ab initio} quantum chemistry programs is the result; of an ongoing attempt by a cadre of graduate students, postdoctoral; associates, and professors to produce code that is efficient but also; easy to extend to new theoretical methods. Significant effort has been; devoted to the development of libraries which are robust and easy to use.; Some of the earliest contributions to what is now referred to as ``PSI''; include a direct configuration interaction (CI) program (Robert Lucchese,; 1976, now at Texas A\&M), the well-known graphical unitary group CI program; (Bernie Brooks, 1977-78, now at N.I.H.), and the original integrals code; (Russ Pitzer, 1978, now at Ohio State). From 1978-1987, the package was; know as the {\tt BERKELEY} suite, and after the Schaefer group moved to the; Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry at the University of Georgia,; the package was renamed {\tt PSI}. Thanks primarily to the efforts of Curt; Janssen (Sandia Labs, Livermore) and Ed Seidl (LLNL), the package was; ported to UNIX systems, and substantially improved with new input formats; and a C-based I/O system. Beginning in 1999, an extensive effort was begun to develop \PSIthree\; --- a {\tt PSI} suite with a completely new face. As a result of this; effort, all of the legacy Fortran code was removed, and everything was; rewritten in C and C++, including new integral/derivative integral,; coupled cluster, and CI codes. In addition, new I/O libraries have; been added, as well as an improved checkpoint file structure and greater; automation of typical tasks such as geometry optimization and frequency; analysis. The package has the capability to determine wavefunctions,; energies, analytic gradients, and various molecular properties based on; a variety of theories, including spin-restricted, spin-unrestricted, and; restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (RHF, UHF, and ROHF); configuration; interaction (CI",efficient,MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst:259,efficient,259,doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst,1,['efficient'],['efficient'],"The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance.

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content: %; % History of Psi; %; % Daniel Crawford, 24 January, 1996; %. The PSI suite of {\em ab initio} quantum chemistry programs is the result; of an ongoing attempt by a cadre of graduate students, postdoctoral; associates, and professors to produce code that is efficient but also; easy to extend to new theoretical methods. Significant effort has been; devoted to the development of libraries which are robust and easy to use.; Some of the earliest contributions to what is now referred to as ``PSI''; include a direct configuration interaction (CI) program (Robert Lucchese,; 1976, now at Texas A\&M), the well-known graphical unitary group CI program; (Bernie Brooks, 1977-78, now at N.I.H.), and the original integrals code; (Russ Pitzer, 1978, now at Ohio State). From 1978-1987, the package was; know as the {\tt BERKELEY} suite, and after the Schaefer group moved to the; Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry at the University of Georgia,; the package was renamed {\tt PSI}. Thanks primarily to the efforts of Curt; Janssen (Sandia Labs, Livermore) and Ed Seidl (LLNL), the package was; ported to UNIX systems, and substantially improved with new input formats; and a C-based I/O system. Beginning in 1999, an extensive effort was begun to develop \PSIthree\; --- a {\tt PSI} suite with a completely new face. As a result of this; effort, all of the legacy Fortran code was removed, and everything was; rewritten in C and C++, including new integral/derivative integral,; coupled cluster, and CI codes. In addition, new I/O libraries have; been added, as well as an improved checkpoint file structure and greater; automation of typical tasks such as geometry optimization and frequency; analysis. The package has the capability to determine wavefunctions,; energies, analytic gradients, and various molecular properties based on; a variety of theories, including spin-restricted, spin-unrestricted, and; restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (RHF, UHF, and ROHF); configuration; interaction (CI
