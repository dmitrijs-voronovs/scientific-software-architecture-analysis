Will post a followup with some highlights/conclusions. # FFT-based Poisson solver benchmarks. ## Raw numbers. ```; FFT-based Poisson solver benchmarks; ┌───────────────┬─────┬────────────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬───────────┬────────┐; │ Architectures │ Ns │ Topologies │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├───────────────┼─────┼────────────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼───────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Bounded, Bounded, Bounded) │ 560.466 ms │ 563.145 ms │ 563.074 ms │ 566.700 ms │ 192 bytes │ 4 │; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Bounded, Bounded, Periodic) │ 434.408 ms │ 435.974 ms │ 437.003 ms │ 441.246 ms │ 160 bytes │ 2 │; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Bounded, Periodic, Bounded) │ 472.312 ms │ 473.340 ms │ 473.620 ms │ 475.649 ms │ 160 bytes │ 2 │; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Bounded, Periodic, Periodic) │ 333.460 ms │ 334.702 ms │ 334.998 ms │ 336.918 ms │ 160 bytes │ 2 │; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Periodic, Bounded, Bounded) │ 495.012 ms │ 497.853 ms │ 497.462 ms │ 500.181 ms │ 160 bytes │ 2 │; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Periodic, Bounded, Periodic) │ 363.169 ms │ 365.104 ms │ 365.891 ms │ 373.893 ms │ 160 bytes │ 2 │; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded) │ 349.305 ms │ 350.431 ms │ 352.641 ms │ 371.861 ms │ 160 bytes │ 2 │; │ CPU │ 192 │ (Periodic, Periodic, Periodic) │ 203.109 ms │ 203.653 ms │ 204.025 ms │ 206.834 ms │ 192 bytes │ 4 │; │ GPU │ 192 │ (Bounded, Bounded, Bounded) │ 7.765 ms │ 16.841 ms │ 15.934 ms │ 16.872 ms │ 84.00 KiB │ 904 │; │ GPU │ 192 │ (Bounded, Bounded, Periodic) │ 6.492 ms │ 13.599 ms │ 12.878 ms │ 13.633 ms │ 57.50 KiB │ 651 │; │ GPU │ 192 │ (Bounded, Peri

I don't think we have that many kernels (just 5 bigger ones) but one of them; https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/2b64d584c79ece0429f2421335ddb6bc0c6c6663/src/time_steppers.jl#L213; has several layers of inlining (it's inlining the majority of the functions in [operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl](https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/master/src/operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl)) after which it probably balloons up to be a pretty big kernel. They also have tons of arguments crammed in as the structs I was passing weren't `isbitstype` (working on this #59). I should come back and update this issue once we do some proper benchmarking (note to self: nvprof seems like it's being deprecated in favor of Nsight). Caching kernels between sessions sounds tough but will definitely look into timing compilations in CUDAnative, might provide some insight on how to speed things up.

Testability,"Thanks @suyashbire1 !. > Unfortunately, this doesn't work. Is this a bug or is the operation being carried out in a different way?. Hmm, there may be an issue with derivatives and specifying locations. I'm not sure you hit it here though. The issue is that the `@at` macro does not change the location of operations *inside* a derivative (because the `Derivative` type itself does not allow this). I'm not sure we need this. To summarize what `Derivative` does:. 1. It computes the derivative of a field, which `flips` the location of the field along the direction of the derivative,; 2. It interpolates the *result* to some specified location. Is this expected / desired? We can also introduce the possibility to interpolate fields *prior* to taking derivatives. I think in general we want the former (post-derivative interpolation), but its hard to say we *always* want that for ""arbitrary"" operations. Because `ζ` does not involve interpolation, we can interpret `ζ_at_u` as interpolating `ζ` in `y` from Face to Cell point. So . ```julia; ζ_at_u[i, j, k] = 0.5 * (ζ[i, j, k] + ζ[i, j+1, k]); ```.

I'd also be very interested how AB2 compares against RK3 for time-to-solution. I guess this could be readily tested with the non-hydrostatic model simulating turbulence. I'd be curious if RK3 is always faster, or if it's case-dependent.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Thanks for all the context! . Good points about the time step being more restricted by Coriolis for coarse global simulations and error being dominated by spatial discretization. I'd also be very interested how AB2 compares against RK3 for time-to-solution. I guess this could be readily tested with the non-hydrostatic model simulating turbulence. I'd be curious if RK3 is always faster, or if it's case-dependent. Although it is risky to be on the edge of stability CFL-wise. > It may be a research project to adapt the split-explicit free surface. .

Quality Attribute: Testability

Content: Thanks for explaining why the `C` values are different, didn't realize that. Not sure where it comes from but shouldn't it be `C_roz = 4/24 = 0.167` or `C_roz = 8/24 = 0.33`?. > I'm open to changing the implementation, but I'm not sure what the best route is. Possibly we will phase out the Rozema version... ?. Not sure how much code overlaps between the two, but if both are deemed important enough to maintain, then the shared functionality can go into `amd_core.jl` or something. Although probably a bad idea to do this refactor before each AMD closure has it's own regression test.

The good news is that the `ShallowWaterModel`, in both weak and strong scaling, reaches efficienties of around 80% on 128 cores. This is something we can probably make better but not the first concern. The not so good news is that the `NonhydrostaticModel`, the efficiency goes down close to 10%. I don't know why but wanted to mention it as it's something that we should be able to do much better with. Thoughts? @christophernhill @glwagner @ali-ramadhan

Testability,"Thanks to @leios and @francispoulin for feedback that helped locate the issue!. Resolves #1170 . This PR fixes a bug in how index unpermutation is done as part of the Makhoul (1980) fast cosine transform algorithm we use for the GPU. It only affected wall-bounded dimensions of odd length (see below). Oceananigans was effectively setting the pressure to zero at the topmost grid point (it was actually accessing memory from out-of-bounds but since the bug was pretty consistent I assume it always grabbed some close-to-zero number). I'm shocked that no test picked this up... But looking at our tests, we don't test dimensions of odd length on the GPU.

We tested it with `bottom_value = 0` and the velocity was spinning down under friction at the bottom so we must have been doing something right. We can implement the `Value` boundary conditions. There might be an analytic solution for the spin-down of a fluid with constant velocity under friction that we can test against.

Testability,"The main contribution of this pull request is a refactor of the function `time_step!` and related functions to reduce code duplication and improve readability. There is now a function called `time_step_kernel!` that dispatches on the value of its first argument (provided by `model.metadata`) to execute on the CPU or GPU. A `Model` constructor is now provided in which all important information can be input via keyword arguments. I favor this kind of design for fluids codes because I believe it improves the understand-ability of scripts, as it encourages explicit naming of parameters passed into the `Model` constructor. The output writing functionality has also been refactored slightly. However, many more changes will be made in the future so this is not consequential. I also reduced the computational burden of a few of the tests, and changed to factor of 2 resolutions since this makes sense for FFTs (though relatively unimportant for testing, I think should encourage users to use powers of 2 and make a habit of using them ourselves).

Testability,"This PR _finally_ revives the half-baked `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` implementation that's been living in Oceananigans.jl for over a year. It also formalizes the `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` that's been living in `test_solvers.jl` for a while as well. I re-ran the regression tests using a `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` with constant spacing as a sanity check and they pass on the CPU which is good and helped uncover some functions that needed generalization. There's still quite a bit to do and test so maybe we should merge this PR after a bit of polish and continue developing and testing the `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` in subsequent smaller PRs?. TODO off the top of my head:; 1. Adapt `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` to work in GPU kernels. It has some offset arrays.; 2. Test the `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` for other/all topologies.; 3. Add some dynamics tests?; 4. Validation experiment: Stratified Couette flow (Vreugdenhil & Taylor, 2018).; 5. Benchmarks!

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: This PR _finally_ revives the half-baked `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` implementation that's been living in Oceananigans.jl for over a year. It also formalizes the `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` that's been living in `test_solvers.jl` for a while as well. I re-ran the regression tests using a `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` with constant spacing as a sanity check and they pass on the CPU which is good and helped uncover some functions that needed generalization. There's still quite a bit to do and test so maybe we should merge this PR after a bit of polish and continue developing and testing the `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` in subsequent smaller PRs?. TODO off the top of my head:; 1. Adapt `VerticallyStretchedCartesianGrid` to work in GPU kernels. It has some offset arrays.; 2. Test the `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` for other/all topologies.; 3. Add some dynamics tests?; 4. Validation experiment: Stratified Couette flow (Vreugdenhil & Taylor, 2018).; 5. Benchmarks! The xy FFT + z Tridiagonal solver might be faster than xyz FFT. Resolves #471.

Testability,"This PR adds a benchmarking script that times how long a single time step takes on the CPU and GPU using `Float32` and `Float64` for various model resolutions. It uses TimerOutputs.jl to nicely format the benchmarks. It also prints out CPU->GPU speedups and Float64->Float32 ""speedups"". It only executes the GPU benchmarks if executed on a CUDA-enabled machine. We can later extend it to time model initialization, different parts of the time stepping, etc. Right now it only benchmarks a simple ""static ocean"" configuration so no fancy forcing functions are used, but we can extend the number of scenarios/experiments we benchmark. The time stepping and Poisson solver still takes the same amount of time whether the ocean is static or active. Resolves #67. Well, kind of. It's not clear to me how to easily incorperate this with CI in a way that doesn't involve one of us eyeballing the text output.

Background fields are specified with a `NamedTuple` similar to forcing functions and boundary conditions:. ```julia; background_u(x, y, z, t) = z * sin(t). model = IncompressibleModel(grid=grid, background_fields=(u,), ...); ```. Background fields are neglected in all tendency terms _except_ the advection terms. This restricts their use, but greatly simplifies their implementation. Todo:. - [x] update physics docs to include background fields in model equations; - [x] update model setup docs; - [x] tests; - [x] update `eady_turbulence.jl` and `internal_wave.jl` example to use `background_fields`; - [x] extend implementation of `FunctionField` to take parameters and add a special constructor for background `FunctionFields`. Resolves #960

I don't think we can have a non-zero gravity component along a periodic direction as the fluid just free falls along that dimension and the model blows up. But here's a thermal bubble rising with gravity tilted at 45 degrees. ![tilted_gravity_plume](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20099589/100940093-5ab5d600-34c5-11eb-918e-f574f284f024.gif). This is an experimental feature since it needs more rigorous testing and because full support for tilted gravity may require more work, e.g.; 1. Should AMD use `z_dot_g_b` now?; 2. Should `∂x_b` return a vector or should it be split up into `x_dot_∂x_b`, etc.? The Leith closure uses `∂x_b`.; 3. We may want to clean up and refactor the implementation, taking some suggestions from #1151. cc @tomchor . Resolves #1151

Testability,"This PR adds new features to the `NetCDFOutputWriter` and fixes some bugs. 1. It now always writes useful metadata to all NetCDF files (the date the file was generated, the Julia version, and the Oceananigans version used). This is essential for reproducibility.; 2. Add a `verbose` flag (default is `false`) in case you want to track what's being to disk and how long it takes for each output to be computed.; 3. Add an `include_halos` flag (default is `false`) in case you want to use the full grid including halos to write fields and custom output. Added new tests for this.; 4. Test that the x, y, z coordinates being written to NetCDF files are correct. They were not (I think this happened when we switched to using offset arrays for `grid.xC`, etc.). This has been fixed.; 5. Added jldoctest examples showing how to write fields and custom output to NetCDF.; 6. There was a bug in showing/printing grid domains for bounded dimensions, e.g.; ```julia; julia> grid = RegularCartesianGrid(size=(16, 16, 16), extent=(1, 1, 1)); RegularCartesianGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded}; domain: x ∈ [0.0, 1.0], y ∈ [0.0, 1.0], z ∈ [-1.0, 0.0625]; topology: (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded); resolution (Nx, Ny, Nz): (16, 16, 16); halo size (Hx, Hy, Hz): (1, 1, 1); grid spacing (Δx, Δy, Δz): (0.0625, 0.0625, 0.0625); ```; Notice that `z ∈ [-1.0, 0.0625]` should be `z ∈ [-1.0, 0.0]`.

I have made the assumption that the user will primarly be interested in the (latitude, longitude) of each grid point. So the grid stores e.g. Δλ and λᶠᵃᵃ instead of Δx and xᶠᵃᵃ. `RegularLatitudeLongitudeGrid` seems possible with very little memory as the grid spacings are cheap to compute, so I think we should try computing as much as we can on the fly.

Testability,"This PR extends the implementation of `IsotropicDiffusivity` to accept `AbstractField`s (such as `ComputedField`) as diffusivities and viscosities. Using this implementation with `model.velocities` or `model.tracers` requires that users instantiate the velocity and tracer fields prior to building the model. The test provided with this PR gives an example:. ```julia; arch = CPU(); grid = RegularCartesianGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 2, 3)) . tracer_names = (:T, :S, :c) ; u, v, w = velocities = VelocityFields(arch, grid); T, S, c = tracers = TracerFields(arch, grid, tracer_names). ν = @at (Cell, Cell, Cell) u^2 * ∂z(T); κ = @at (Cell, Cell, Cell) S * c * sin(T). closure = IsotropicDiffusivity(ν = ComputedField(ν),; κ = ComputedField(κ)). model = IncompressibleModel(architecture=arch, grid=grid, closure=closure,; velocities=velocities, tracers=tracers); ```. A major gotcha with this implementation is that users _must_ pass the velocity and tracer fields on to `IncompressibleModel` (or the prescribed viscosity will be meaningless. We should probably also ensure that diffusivities-as-`Field`s are located at `Cell, Cell, Cell`, as the viscous and diffusive flux operators assume.

This means that both the docs and the code were incorrect. The tests passed because these two bugs effectively cancel each other out. This PR fixes both bugs.

I didn't see immediately where to replace `ΔzC` with `ΔzF` in `solve_poisson_equation!`. The tests may pass anyways because there is no test that incompressibility is maintained on a stretched grid.

In other words, the Laplacian operator was correct for an object located at `(Face, Face, Face)`, rather than `(Center, Center, Center)` as it was being applied.; 2. `ΔzF` and `ΔzC` were also swapped in derivation of the `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver`. This means that both the docs and the code were incorrect. The tests passed because these two bugs effectively cancel each other out. This PR fixes both bugs. There still may be a lingering issue however, because the docs multiply the entire Poisson equation by the vertical grid spacing (which in the docs is written `ΔzC`, but should be `ΔzF`), including the source term. I didn't see immediately where to replace `ΔzC` with `ΔzF` in `solve_poisson_equation!`. The tests may pass anyways because there is no test that incompressibility is maintained on a stretched grid. I also cleaned up the Laplacian operators a bit, and the grid spacing operators, and added a convenience function `set_source_term!` so that users don't have to know about the special formulation that `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` uses. TODO:. - [x] Update the docs; - [x] Test incompressibility on a stretched grid

This will allow biharmonic diffusivities to be used in closed domains or along `Bounded` dimensions.

This was already done for the first derivative, but did not work for third derivatives and higher. In this PR, kernels are written that _reflect_ fields across the boundary for flux boundary conditions. Reflection implies that odd derivatives are zero and ensures that no flux is enforced for diffusivities of order higher than two. Note that `Value` and `Gradient` boundary conditions do not work for biharmonic diffusivity (and likely never will).

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: This PR generalizes `fill_halo_regions!` for flux boundary conditions to work correctly for biharmonic diffusivities, in addition to second-order diffusivities. This will allow biharmonic diffusivities to be used in closed domains or along `Bounded` dimensions. In particular (and after tweaking the definition of `AnisotropicBiharmonicDiffusivity`), no flux conditions on any even diffusion operator are enforced by ensuring that odd derivatives across the boundary are zero. This was already done for the first derivative, but did not work for third derivatives and higher. In this PR, kernels are written that _reflect_ fields across the boundary for flux boundary conditions. Reflection implies that odd derivatives are zero and ensures that no flux is enforced for diffusivities of order higher than two. Note that `Value` and `Gradient` boundary conditions do not work for biharmonic diffusivity (and likely never will). Thus only `Flux` and `Periodic` boundary conditions are supported with biharmonic diffusivity. This PR also does some minor shuffling of file content and names, and generalizes the tracer and momentum budget tests.

Testability,"This PR implements vertically-implicit time integration for tracers and momentum. We restrict attention to the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and quasi-Adams-Bashforth time integration. This requires some refactoring of function-calling in `TurbulenceClosures` some upgrades to `BatchedTridiagonalSolver`, and changes to `ab2_step!(model::HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel, dt)`. At first we will only support vertically implicit diffusion for `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicDiffusivity`.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: This PR implements vertically-implicit time integration for tracers and momentum. We restrict attention to the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and quasi-Adams-Bashforth time integration. This requires some refactoring of function-calling in `TurbulenceClosures` some upgrades to `BatchedTridiagonalSolver`, and changes to `ab2_step!(model::HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel, dt)`. At first we will only support vertically implicit diffusion for `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicDiffusivity`. However, `TurbulenceClosures` has been extensively refactored to permit quick extension of vertically-implicit time-stepping to `IsotropicDiffusivity`, `AnisotropicDiffusivity`, and LES closures. ~~There are a few questions to answer before implementing implicit time-stepping there that we should discuss in issues.~~ It should be straightforward enough to implement vertically implicit time stepping for these closures and test them with existing regression tests.

There's also a new constructor `AuxiliaryFieldBoundaryConditions` which takes the place of `ComputedFieldBoundaryConditions` and is now the default for `Field` and `ComputedField`. The difference is that `AuxiliaryFieldBoundaryConditions` have `nothing` instead of an `ImpenetrableBoundaryCondition` in `Bounded` directions when they're located on faces. Under the hood the `FieldBoundaryConditions` struct is ""flattened"" so there's no more `CoordinateBoundaryConditions`. In addition, a new field `immersed` is added to `FieldBoundaryConditions` in addition to `east`, `west`, etc. This will be used to support boundary conditions on immersed boundaries in the future. There's still quite a few validation experiments to clean up and probably some lingering issues with tests, but I was able to get the examples to run so I thought it was the right time to open the PR. On the API changes: it seemed like a positive change that we don't need `grid` in the boundary conditions constructor, and that we only have one name `FieldBoundaryConditions` rather than 4. However, if others feel they liked the old API, we can add convenience functions `TracerBoundaryConditions`, etc back to the source.

Do we want `FieldTimeSeries` to support reading from NetCDF? If the answer to (1) is yes then this shouldn't be hard to support.; 3. Right now function boundary conditions are lost in serialization.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: This PR is a first stab at tackling #1493. It adds a `FieldTimeSeries` type that stores a time series of an entire field taken from a JLD2 file and a `FieldDataset` function that stores all the fields from a JLD2 file in a `Dict{String,FieldTimeSeries}`. There are two flavors: `FieldTimeSeries{InMemory}` where the data is loaded fully into memory into a 4D array, and `FieldTimeSeries{OnDisk}` which lazily loads different time snapshots from disk. Indexing linearly into a `FieldTimeSeries` returns a `Field`. Immediate TODO:; - [x] Test `architecture = GPU()`. Right now it's pretty barebones. Some more work on `Oceananigans.Fields` might be needed before we get a fully-featured `FieldTimeSeries`. Eventually it would be great to be able to be able to:; 1. Have `FieldTimeSeries` work with abstract operations like it was a `Field` broadcasting over time.; 2. Work with `FieldTimeSeries` as if it were a 4D array (with operations ignoring the halos).; 2. Have named dimensions, slick selectors, and references dimensions through DimensionalData.jl. Some things to think about:; 1. Since the aim is to work with abstract operations, `FieldTimeSeries` right now only work with JLD2 data that includes halos. Do we want to support loading data without halos?; 2. Do we want `FieldTimeSeries` to support reading from NetCDF? If the answer to (1) is yes then this shouldn't be hard to support.; 3. Right now function boundary conditions are lost in serialization. We should probably allow users to specify boundary conditions on `FieldTimeSeries`.

A small benchmark for an ensemble of 8000 columns (400 by 20) achieves. ```julia; [ Info: Benchmarking...; 3.265 ms (6015 allocations: 2.54 MiB); ```. per time-step on a Titan V. This is a speed up of 1800x over a single column simulation with Oceananigans. This will hopefully prove useful for calibrating boundary layer parameterizations. @xiaozhour we can use a similar ""slice ensemble"" abstraction to simulate independent 2D slices for the purpose of calibrating mesoscale parameterizations, potentially.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: This PR provides a convenience constructor for building `UniformStokesDrift` with four `Field`s for the Stokes shear and tendency, rather than functions. It also adds kernel functions for the field case, so users now have the choice between functions of `(z, t)`, `Field`s, or `nothing`. This is useful when calculating the Stokes profile is a relatively expensive or involved computation (eg, involving integration over a spectrum of waves). This permits two optimizations:. 1. Stationary Stokes shear profiles can be precomputed.; 2. Time-dependent Stokes shear profiles and Stokes tendencies can be computed in a `Callback`. This saves computation time for 3D runs because the Stokes profiles are 1D.; ; co-authored with @qingli411. TODO: . - [x] add a test

Testability,"This PR removes part of the time-stepping algorithm that uses the continuity equation to 'recompute' the vertical velocity at the end of a time-step, after using a fractional step to project the predictor velocity field onto an incompressible field.; This recomputation of vertical velocity relies on a discrete vertical integral of the continuity equation starting at the bottom of the domain and proceeding upwards. The reason for omitting ""w recomputation"" is primarily because vertically integrating the continuity equation _accumulates_ pressure projection round-off error into the vertical velocity field, biased towards the top of the domain. Most models are probably unaffected by this error accumulation and upward bias. However, accumulation of round-off error in a particular part of the domain may become a problem for models with high vertical resolution. The recomputation step also has a computational cost, and the top of the domain is crucial in many oceanographic contexts. The incompressibility of the flow field is still assured without this recomputation step, and it is probable that the velocity field errors are more isotropic and therefore probably more benign. We should note that the error in the _divergence_ is larger without recomputation. However, it probably still falls below acceptable limits, and it does not accumulate in time. With this change the regression tests fail. Also, an ""incompressibility test"" that relies on a measurement of the absolute magnitude of the divergence error fails.

Testability,"This PR reorganizes the diagnostics structs and introduces a new `VerticalProfile` diagnostic that can calculate vertical profiles efficiently on-the-fly on CPUs and GPUs. Product profiles and velocity covariance profiles are built on top of it. `HorizontallyAveragedVerticalProfile` would be a more accurate name, but is much longer. So I'm sticking with the ""convention"" that a profile is implied to be horizontally averaged. The `profile` can be passed to an output writer which can write it to disk. The horizontal averaging currently relies on a parallel reduction prefix sum algorithm that I hacked over a CUDAnative.jl example, although I do have a test for the diagnostic so it does work. The algorithm can be more efficient (see https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CuArrays.jl/issues/68). It allocates very minimal amounts of memory (less than `mean`) and benchmarks show that it is ~20x faster than what we were doing before (copying to CPU and calculating there) which is great but it's ~5x slower than optimal performance. As it does not allocate memory, we can now calculate vertical profiles even when running large models that fill up memory. Although I should mention that an intermediate array with a size of at least `1*Ny*Nz` is required for the parallel reduction step (so I'm using `poisson_solvers.storage` because it's a vanilla CuArray that can be overwritten). ```julia; N, H = 512, 1; T = N + 2H. a = rand(T, T, T) |> CuArray; h = zeros(N) |> CuArray; ```.

So I'm sticking with the ""convention"" that a profile is implied to be horizontally averaged. The `profile` can be passed to an output writer which can write it to disk. The horizontal averaging currently relies on a parallel reduction prefix sum algorithm that I hacked over a CUDAnative.jl example, although I do have a test for the diagnostic so it does work. The algorithm can be more efficient (see https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CuArrays.jl/issues/68). It allocates very minimal amounts of memory (less than `mean`) and benchmarks show that it is ~20x faster than what we were doing before (copying to CPU and calculating there) which is great but it's ~5x slower than optimal performance. As it does not allocate memory, we can now calculate vertical profiles even when running large models that fill up memory. Although I should mention that an intermediate array with a size of at least `1*Ny*Nz` is required for the parallel reduction step (so I'm using `poisson_solvers.storage` because it's a vanilla CuArray that can be overwritten). ```julia; N, H = 512, 1; T = N + 2H. a = rand(T, T, T) |> CuArray; h = zeros(N) |> CuArray; ```. What we were doing before:; ```julia; @benchmark CuArrays.@sync mean(Array(view(a, H:N+H, H:N+H, H:N+H)), dims=[1, 2]). BenchmarkTools.Trial: ; memory estimate: 1.01 GiB; allocs estimate: 250; --------------; minimum time: 684.013 ms (2.29% GC); median time: 712.570 ms (6.28% GC); mean time: 732.480 ms (8.79% GC); maximum time: 807.437 ms (16.95% GC); --------------; samples: 7; evals/sample: 1; ```.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: This PR updates the ancient `test_flux_budget` to be able to test all topologies and boundaries. I've also called it `test_incompressible_flux_budget` since it uses `IncompressibleModel`. This will allow us to generalize `apply_x_bcs` and `apply_y_bcs` to curvilinear grids without fear that we've broken something.

First off, here's the command I'm using to run the script:. ```; $ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/bin/mpiexecjl --project -n 2 julia --project distributed_nonhydrostatic_model_mpi.jl 8 8 8 1 2 1; ```. Which should (if I understand correctly) create a simulation on an 8x8x8 grid that partitioned into 2 in the y direction. However, I always get this error:. ```; [2022/04/12 16:43:26.454] INFO Setting up distributed nonhydrostatic model with N=(8, 8, 8) grid points and ranks=(1, 2, 1) on rank 0...; [2022/04/12 16:43:26.473] INFO Setting up distributed nonhydrostatic model with N=(8, 8, 8) grid points and ranks=(1, 2, 1) on rank 1...; [2022/04/12 16:43:56.216] INFO Warming up distributed nonhydrostatic model on rank 0...; [2022/04/12 16:43:56.216] INFO Warming up distributed nonhydrostatic model on rank 1...; ERROR: ERROR: LoadError: LoadError: DimensionMismatch(DimensionMismatch(""arrays could not be broadcast to a common size; got a dimension with lengths 8 and 4""); Stacktrace:; [1] ""arrays could not be broadcast to a common size; got a dimension with lengths 8 and 4""); Stacktrace:; [1] _bcs1; @ ./broadcast.jl:501 [inlined]; [2] _bcs1; @ ./broadcast.jl:501 [inlined]; [2] _bcs(shape::_bcs(shape::Tuple{Base.OneTo{Int64}, Base.OneTo{Int64}, Base.OneTo{Int64}}, newshape::Tuple{Base.OneTo{Int64}, Base.OneTo{Int64}, Base.OneTo{Int64}}); @ Base.Broadcast ./broadcast.jl:495; [3] broadcast_shape; @ ./broadcast.jl:489 [inlined]; [4] combine_axes; @ ./broadcast.jl:484 [inlined]; [5] _axes; @ ./broadcast.jl:209 [inlined]; [6] axes; @ ./broadcast.jl:207 [inlined]; [7] _unwrap_pa(bc::Tuple{Base.OneTo{Int64}

Testability,"This problem may be an issue with the vertically stretched grid rather than the FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver. The mixed FFT/Tridiagonal Poisson solver uses similar constructs as the FFTBased Poisson solver. The two ingredients are 1) a Fourier transform in the `Flat` direction, and 2) computation of the eigenvalues:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/5fbd8cd20c5db8e9b11b6175984e7592a08fc874/src/Solvers/poisson_eigenvalues.jl#L8-L11. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/5fbd8cd20c5db8e9b11b6175984e7592a08fc874/src/Solvers/poisson_eigenvalues.jl#L31. The first eigenvalue is 0, so the `Flat` case is correct. It's also used for the fully FFT-based solver and we know it works in that context. The transforms must be fine too.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: This problem may be an issue with the vertically stretched grid rather than the FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver. The mixed FFT/Tridiagonal Poisson solver uses similar constructs as the FFTBased Poisson solver. The two ingredients are 1) a Fourier transform in the `Flat` direction, and 2) computation of the eigenvalues:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/5fbd8cd20c5db8e9b11b6175984e7592a08fc874/src/Solvers/poisson_eigenvalues.jl#L8-L11. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/5fbd8cd20c5db8e9b11b6175984e7592a08fc874/src/Solvers/poisson_eigenvalues.jl#L31. The first eigenvalue is 0, so the `Flat` case is correct. It's also used for the fully FFT-based solver and we know it works in that context. The transforms must be fine too. The grids differ though in how grid metrics are computed, so I suspect the problem is there. I think we've also had issues with `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` with `Flat` topologies, but I haven't looked into it systematically. We might be able to convert the internal wave ~~setup~~ dynamics test to a vertically bounded domain and put it on a stretched grid to test these issues.
