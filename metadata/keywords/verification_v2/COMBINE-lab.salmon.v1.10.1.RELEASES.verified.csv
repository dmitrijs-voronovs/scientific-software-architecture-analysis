Availability,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Availability,"This is a minor release, but it nonetheless adds a few important features and fixes an outstanding bug. This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed.

For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:; * `--read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]`. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read `2`, and it spans from the first index `1` (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the `end` of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read `1` and occupies positions `1-16`, and the UMI comes from read `1` and occupies positions `17-26`. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify `--bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23]` to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1. It is even possible to have the string pieced together across both reads, but that functionality is only available if you are running with `--rad` or `--sketch` and preparing a RAD file for alevin-fry. _If you are running classic alevin, the barcode must reside on a single read_. The robust parsing of the flexible geometry syntax is made possible by the [cpp-peglib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-peglib) project.; ; * Alevin learned the ability to annotate output SAM files with the `CB` and `UR` tags. If you write a SAM file by running alevin with `--writeMappings`, then the resulting SAM file will have `CB` and `UR` tags in the alignment records to record the cell barcode and UMI for the fragment. ; ; * A new command-line flag `--noWhitelist` is added to explicitly disable the 'intelligent-whitelist' by alevin.

Availability,"e used for bias correction to be incorrect. The code was assuming zero-initalization of memory which was not necessarily occuring. **Note**: This bug affects runs performed under mapping-based mode (i.e. when the input was not coming from a BAM file) and when `--seqBias` or `--gcBias` flags (or both) were used. Depending upon the initialization of the underlying memory, the bug _may_ lead to unexpected results and diminished accuracy. The bug was present in versions 0.99.0 beta 1 through 1.0.0 (inclusive), and if you processed data using these versions in mapping-based mode with the flags mentioned above, _we encourage you to reprocess this data with the newest version, just in case_. We apologize for any inconvenience. * Fixed a bug that would occur when the input fasta file contained short sequences (<= length k) near the end of the file and bias correction (sequence-specific or fragment-GC) was enabled.

Content: e used for bias correction to be incorrect. The code was assuming zero-initalization of memory which was not necessarily occuring. **Note**: This bug affects runs performed under mapping-based mode (i.e. when the input was not coming from a BAM file) and when `--seqBias` or `--gcBias` flags (or both) were used. Depending upon the initialization of the underlying memory, the bug _may_ lead to unexpected results and diminished accuracy. The bug was present in versions 0.99.0 beta 1 through 1.0.0 (inclusive), and if you processed data using these versions in mapping-based mode with the flags mentioned above, _we encourage you to reprocess this data with the newest version, just in case_. We apologize for any inconvenience. * Fixed a bug that would occur when the input fasta file contained short sequences (<= length k) near the end of the file and bias correction (sequence-specific or fragment-GC) was enabled. This is particularly acute when the short sequence was immediately preceded by a very long target and would cause *inordinate* warning message printing to the log (hugely slowing down index loading). This printing to the log could slow the index loading considerably.

Using the `--validateMappings` flag has two main potential benefits. First, this will help prevent salmon from considering potentially spurious mappings (i.e., mappings supported by only a few MMPs but which nonetheless would not support a high-quality read alignment). Second, this will help assign more appropriate mapping scores to reads that map to similar (but not identical) reference sequences --- essentially helping to appropriately down-weight sub-optimal mappings. Along with this flag, salmon introduces flags to set the match score (`--ma`), mismatch penalty (`--mp`), and gap open (`--go`) and extension (`--ge`) scores used when computing the alignment. It also allows the user to specify the minimum relative alignment score that will be considered as a valid mapping (`--minScoreFraction`). While these can all be customized, the defaults should be reasonable for typical use cases.

Content:  experiment into the file `alevin_meta_info.json` inside the aux folder of the output directory. * `EquivalenceClassBuilder` object will now have a single cell `SCRGValue` templaization, which will marginally reduce the memory used by the object. * Salmon's `--initUniform` flag has been linked with alevin, if enabled through command line (default false) it initialized the EM step with a uniform prior instead of with a unique equivalence class evidence. * Alevin can directly consume `bfh` file format generated using `--dumpBfh`. It provides an independant entry point into alevin's UMI deduplication step instead of the raw `FASTQ` files. * A bug in UMI deduplication step has been fixed. Previously the vertices in the maximum connected components of an arborescence were not being removed. * The `custom` mode of the single cell protocol for alevin, does not need explicit protocol specific command line flag. Although the full triplet `--umiLength --barcodeLength --end` command line options has to be specified to enable the `custom` mode. * Maximum allowable length of a barcode and/or the UMI has been set to 20 for the `custom` mode of a single cell experiment. * A new command line option `--keepCBFraction` has been added, which expects a value in the range (0, 1]. This parameter forces `alevin` to use the specified fraction of all the observed Cellular barcode in the input reads _after_ sequence correction. ## Bug fixes, deprecations and removals. * Fixed a rare bug that could cause salmon and alevin to ""hang"" when many read files were provided as input at the number of records in the read file were a divisor of the mini-batch size. Thanks to @rbenel for finding a dataset that triggers this bug and reporting it in #329. * The `--strictIntersect` flag led to unnecessary complexity in the codebase, and it seems, was not really used by anyone, so it was removed to simplify and streamline the code. * The `--useFSPD` flag has been deprecated for many releases and was removed.

This issue has been reported upstream in bbhash as [issue 19](https://github.com/rizkg/BBHash/issues/19). * Fixed an issue with long target names (raised in issue [451](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/451)) not being allowed in the index. Previously, in the pufferfish-based index, target names of length > 255 were clipped to 255 characters. While this is not normally a problem, pipelines that attempt to encode significant metadata in the target name may be affected by this limit.

If the `--allowDovetail` flag was passed, these are counted toward quantification, otherwise they are discarded (but this number is still reported). This field only has a meaningful value in quasi-mapping mode (with or without mapping validation).; * `num_fragments_filtered_vm` : which denotes the number of fragments that had a mapping to the transcriptome, but which were discarded because _none_ of the mappings for the fragments exceeded the minimum mapping validation score. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0).; * `num_alignments_below_threshold_for_mapped_fragments_vm` : which denotes the number of _mappings_ discarded because they failed to reach the minimum mapping validation score, but for which the corresponding fragment had at least a single valid mapping. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0). ## Previous Salmon 0.13.0 release notes. ## Change to default behavior. Starting from this version of salmon, dovetailed mappings (see the [Bowtie2 manual](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#mates-can-overlap-contain-or-dovetail-each-other) for a description) are _not_ accepted by default usi

Deployability,"# Salmon 0.14.0 release notes. In addition to the changes and enhancements listed below, this release of salmon implements the decoy-aware selective-alignment strategy described in the manuscript [<ins>Alignment and mapping methodology influence transcript abundance estimation</ins>](http://bit.ly/2Z2Z9kT). For reasons explored in depth in the manuscript, we recommend making use of this decoy-aware selective alignment strategy when not providing pre-aligned reads to salmon. Because of the changes required to implement this indexing strategy, _salmon v0.14.0 is not compatible with the indices of previous versions, and so you must re-build the index for this version of salmon_ (which must be done anyway, if one is adding decoy sequence). ### Adding decoy sequence to the salmon index. . Adding decoy sequence to the salmon index is simple, but salmon is specific about the manner in which the sequence is added. To ease this process, we have created a script that allows the automated creation of a decoy-enhanced transcriptome from a genome FASTA, transcriptome FASTA, and annotation GTF file. The script, as well as detailed instructions on how to run it an use its output, is provided [in the SalmonTools repository](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh). **Note**: Because making effective use of the decoy sequence requires having accurate mapping scores, the decoys are only used when salmon is run with selective alignment (i.e. with the flags `--validateMappings`, `--mimicBT2` or `--mimicStrictBT2`). #### Detailed description of decoy requirements. It is not necessary to use the script we provide to extract decoy sequences, and if you'd like to add your own decoys to the file you wish to index, the process is fairly straightforward.

Deployability,".com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthll` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta2; A bug related to alevin index parsing is fixed. Specifically, if the length of any one decoy target is less than the kmer length then alevin was dumping gene counts for decoy targets. Thanks @csoneson for reporting this and it has been fixed in the latest stable release. ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta1; Allow passing of explicit filter size to the indexing command via the -f parameter (default is to estimate required filter size using nthll). Fix bug that prevented dumping SAM output, if requested, in alevin mode.

Content: .com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthll` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta2; A bug related to alevin index parsing is fixed. Specifically, if the length of any one decoy target is less than the kmer length then alevin was dumping gene counts for decoy targets. Thanks @csoneson for reporting this and it has been fixed in the latest stable release. ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta1; Allow passing of explicit filter size to the indexing command via the -f parameter (default is to estimate required filter size using nthll). Fix bug that prevented dumping SAM output, if requested, in alevin mode. Correctly enabled strictFilter mode in alevin, improving single-cell mapping quality. ## Changes since v0.14.1; The indexing methodology of salmon is now based on pufferfish. Thus, any previous indices need to be re-built. However, the new indexing methodology is considerably faster and more parallelizable than the previous approach, so providing multiple threads to the index command shoule make relatively short work of this task.

Deployability,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory.

TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers.

Deployability,"This is a minor release, but it nonetheless adds a few important features and fixes an outstanding bug. This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed. Instead, salmon would refuse to index these sequences until the d",release,MatchSource.RELEASES,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.1:16,release,16,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.1,3,['release'],"['release', 'releases']","The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed. Instead, salmon would refuse to index these sequences until the d

This significantly improves the mapping rate of the algorithm while providing a good tradeoff between senstivity and specificity. * By default, Alevin now dumps the gene-tiers categorization matrix with the name `quants_tier_mat.gz`, where the row and column order stays the same as `quants_mat.gz`. * `--forceCells X` command line flag forces the Alevin pipeline to use top `X` number of Cellular Barcodes in initial whitelisting part of the pipeline -- skipping the knee method. * `--expectCells X` command line flag uses the 1",configurat,MatchSource.RELEASES,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.12.0:1586,configuration,1586,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.12.0,1,['configurat'],['configuration'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

This records information such as the number of reads processed, the number mapped, the percentage mapped, which type of posterior sampling (e.g. Gibbs / bootstrap), if any, was performed.; - Auxiliary parameters from the run --- In addition to the `meta_info.json` file, the `aux/` directory of the main quantification directory contains other useful files. Specifically, it contains gzipped, binary, data for any bootstrap or Gibbs samples that were generated, and gzipped binary data about the fragment length distribution and bias parameters (the latter is only meaningful if bias-correction was performed). ## Minor Changes; - Position specific start distribution --- Modeling of the position-specific start distribution has been improved, and the way that it is enabled / disabled has been changed. This model is _off_ by default, but is enabled with the `--useFSPD`. ## Bug Fixes; - This release fixes a bug where the mapping location of a fragment may have been miscalculated by a small number of bases in certain cases. This in turn could lead to a small shift in the fragment length distribution and in the resulting quantification estimates. #### Acknowledgements; - Special thanks go to Ayush Sengupta for helping out with the implementation of sequence-specific bias correction.; - Special thanks go to Mike Love for testing the effectiveness of the sequence-specific bias correction implementation (in Sailfish, but this uses the same model) on some experimental (GEUVADIS) data!. #### Note. As you may note, there are two DebianSqueeze binaries listed below.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: nfo.json` under the main quantification directory. This records information such as the number of reads processed, the number mapped, the percentage mapped, which type of posterior sampling (e.g. Gibbs / bootstrap), if any, was performed.; - Auxiliary parameters from the run --- In addition to the `meta_info.json` file, the `aux/` directory of the main quantification directory contains other useful files. Specifically, it contains gzipped, binary, data for any bootstrap or Gibbs samples that were generated, and gzipped binary data about the fragment length distribution and bias parameters (the latter is only meaningful if bias-correction was performed). ## Minor Changes; - Position specific start distribution --- Modeling of the position-specific start distribution has been improved, and the way that it is enabled / disabled has been changed. This model is _off_ by default, but is enabled with the `--useFSPD`. ## Bug Fixes; - This release fixes a bug where the mapping location of a fragment may have been miscalculated by a small number of bases in certain cases. This in turn could lead to a small shift in the fragment length distribution and in the resulting quantification estimates. #### Acknowledgements; - Special thanks go to Ayush Sengupta for helping out with the implementation of sequence-specific bias correction.; - Special thanks go to Mike Love for testing the effectiveness of the sequence-specific bias correction implementation (in Sailfish, but this uses the same model) on some experimental (GEUVADIS) data!. #### Note. As you may note, there are two DebianSqueeze binaries listed below. The binary called `SalmonBeta-0.6.0_DebianSqueeze.tar.gz` is the ""standard"" binary, which is built to use the JEMalloc memory allocator. In certain situations (involving files on NFS) this allocator has been observed to segfault upon program termination.

We highly-recommend that all users upgrade when they have the chance. . _Note_ : Due to the inclusion of the SHA512 hash in the salmon index (see in [other changes](#other-changes) below), existing salmon indices should be rebuilt. ## alevin. _Welcome alevin to the salmon family !_; ; You can find a tutorial describing how to use alevin [here](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/#blog). Working under the salmon engine, alevin brings new algorithms and infrastructure to perform single-cell quantification and analysis based on 3' tagged-end sequencing. The alevin mode is activated by using the `alevin` command, and currently supports quantification of [Drop-seq](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415005498) (`--dropseq`) and [10x v1/2](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14049) (`--chromium`) single-cell protocols (v1 chemistry requires use of a special wrapper). Alevin works on raw-FASTA/Q files and performs the following tasks:. * _Intial Whitelisting_: If not given `--whitelist` (an already known set of whitelisted barcodes e.g. as produced by Cell Ranger), alevin finds a rough estimate for the set of the whitelisted CB (Cellular Barcodes) based on their frequency. * _Barcode Correction_: In the first pass over the CB file, alevin constructs a dictionary for the correction of CB (if not on

To process data with alevin-fry (documentation available [here](https://alevin-fry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), you must first map the reads to the reference transcriptome to generate a RAD file. This is done by running alevin as you would normally do, and by additionally passing the flag `--rad` or `--justAlign`.

This flag is currently relevant only in RAD mode. In fact, this flag currently implies RAD mode (that is `--sketch` is currently the same as `--rad --sketch`). The `--sketch` flag is meant to prioritize mapping speed at the potential cost of reduced specificity. It turns off selective-alignment and instead maps the reads using a custom implementation of psuedoalignment [[1]](#1) with structural constraints (PASC). This consists of executing the k-mer collecting part of a pseudoalignment [[1]](#1) algorithm to collect potentially compatible targets for a fragment, represented by a series of ""hits"". The targets are then filtered to ensure that the collected hits are consistent in their orientation, and co-linear in their placement on the fragment and reference (these are the enforced structural constraints).

This is intended to be used when quantifying based on protocols (e.g., Lexogen Quantseq) where the number of sequenced fragments / tags deriving from a target are assumed to be independent of that target's length. (This feature is still experimental, and requires more testing, so please provide feedback if you use it).; - Added new `--quasiCoverage` option. This is analogous to the `--coverage` option, but the latter applies only to mapping under the FMD-based index (which is no longer recommended). This option enforces that a certain fraction of the _read_ is covered by exact matches (specifically, maximum mappable prefixes) in order to consider a mapping as valid. The value is expressed as a number between 0 and 1; a larger value is more stringent, and less likely to allow spurious mappings, but can reduce sensitivity.; ; ## [New features due to changes and improvements in RapMap](#rapmap-features); - New hash map for default index - The default `quasiindex` command now uses the [sparsepp](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) sparse hash map. While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency

Content:  metagenomic & microbiomic quantification. ; - Added `--dumpEqWeights` option that includes the rich equivalence class weights in the output file when equivalence classes are written to file.; - Added _experimental_ `--noLengthCorrection` option. This is intended to be used when quantifying based on protocols (e.g., Lexogen Quantseq) where the number of sequenced fragments / tags deriving from a target are assumed to be independent of that target's length. (This feature is still experimental, and requires more testing, so please provide feedback if you use it).; - Added new `--quasiCoverage` option. This is analogous to the `--coverage` option, but the latter applies only to mapping under the FMD-based index (which is no longer recommended). This option enforces that a certain fraction of the _read_ is covered by exact matches (specifically, maximum mappable prefixes) in order to consider a mapping as valid. The value is expressed as a number between 0 and 1; a larger value is more stringent, and less likely to allow spurious mappings, but can reduce sensitivity.; ; ## [New features due to changes and improvements in RapMap](#rapmap-features); - New hash map for default index - The default `quasiindex` command now uses the [sparsepp](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) sparse hash map. While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage th

However, sparsepp achieves very similar memory usage to the previous perfect-hash-based index.

Also, for large references, the size of the index on disk is ~40% smaller. The cost of this substantial size reduction is that the _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index takes 2-2.5 times longer to build, and lookups are slower. This slower lookup speed can, conceivably, reduce quasi-mapping speed a bit, but the speed hit (if there is one) is dataset dependent.

Energy Efficiency,"In fact, this flag currently implies RAD mode (that is `--sketch` is currently the same as `--rad --sketch`). The `--sketch` flag is meant to prioritize mapping speed at the potential cost of reduced specificity. It turns off selective-alignment and instead maps the reads using a custom implementation of psuedoalignment [[1]](#1) with structural constraints (PASC). This consists of executing the k-mer collecting part of a pseudoalignment [[1]](#1) algorithm to collect potentially compatible targets for a fragment, represented by a series of ""hits"". The targets are then filtered to ensure that the collected hits are consistent in their orientation, and co-linear in their placement on the fragment and reference (these are the enforced structural constraints).

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content: In fact, this flag currently implies RAD mode (that is `--sketch` is currently the same as `--rad --sketch`). The `--sketch` flag is meant to prioritize mapping speed at the potential cost of reduced specificity. It turns off selective-alignment and instead maps the reads using a custom implementation of psuedoalignment [[1]](#1) with structural constraints (PASC). This consists of executing the k-mer collecting part of a pseudoalignment [[1]](#1) algorithm to collect potentially compatible targets for a fragment, represented by a series of ""hits"". The targets are then filtered to ensure that the collected hits are consistent in their orientation, and co-linear in their placement on the fragment and reference (these are the enforced structural constraints). This algorithm is distinct from the seeding step of selective alignment or the quasi-mapping algorithm, and prioritizes speed.

Energy Efficiency,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Since it is not currently possible to have both releases and ""betas"" in Bioconda, you can get the pre-compiled executables below, or build this version directly from the `develop` [branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/develop) of the salmon repository. . **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthill` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta1. * Allow passing of explicit filter size to the indexing command via the `-f` parameter (default is to estimate required filter size using nthll). * Fix bug that prevented dumping SAM output, if requested, in alevin mode. * Correctly enabled `strictFilter` mode in alevin, improving single-cell mapping quality

For large references, the new _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index exhibits a memory reduction (_over the new, reduced-memory, default index_) of 40-50% (hence, it shows close to this savings over the old perfect-hash-based index as well). Also, for large references, the size of the index on disk is ~40% smaller. The cost of this substantial size reduction is that the _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index takes 2-2.5 times longer to build, and lookups are slower. This slower lookup speed can, conceivably, reduce quasi-mapping speed a bit, but the speed hit (if there is one) is dataset dependent.

If you encounter an issue when using alevin, please be sure to tag your GitHub issue with the `alevin` tag when reporting the issue via GitHub. ## mapping validation. Mapping validation is a new feature that allows salmon to validate its mappings via a traditional (affine-gap penalty) alignment procedure; it is enabled by passing the flag `--validateMappings`. This validation is made efficient (and fast) through a combination of : . - using the very-efficient and highly-vectorized alignment implementation of @lh3's [ksw2](https://github.com/lh3/ksw2) library. - devising a novel caching heuristic that avoids re-aligning reads when sub-problems are redundant (this turns out to be a major computational bottleneck when aligning against the transcriptome). . Using the `--validateMappings` flag has two main potential benefits. First, this will help prevent salmon from considering potentially spurious mappings (i.e., mappings supported by only a few MMPs but which nonetheless would not support a high-quality read alignment). Second, this will help assign more appropriate mapping scores to reads that map to similar (but not identical) reference sequences --- essentially helping to appropriately down-weight sub-optimal mappings. Along with this flag, salmon introduces flags to set the match score (`--ma`), mismatch penalty (`--mp`), and gap open (`--go`) and extension (`--ge`) scores used when computing the alignment.

Integrability,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Optionally, a probabilistic model can be used to soft-assign barcodes, although that behavior is disabled by default. (`--noSoftMap` is `true` ). * _UMI Correction & Deduplication_: alevin introduces a novel method for deduplicating the UMIs (Unique Molecule identifiers) present in a sample. Alevin's algorithm uses equivalence-class-level information to infer when the same UMI must arise from different isoforms of a gene (to

We urge you to move over to the `quasi` index if you are not already using it.; - Sequence-specific bias correction --- The old bias correction methodology has been removed from Salmon and replaced with a new sequence-specific bias correction model. Bias correction is enabled with the `--biasCorrect` flag. The new model has numerous benefits over the old. First, it should more accurately correct for sequence specific biases, leading to better estimates in biased samples. Second, it should not suffer from the same pathological ""over-correction"" failure cases of the old model --- if there is no substantial bias in the sample, it should have only a minimal effect on quantification results.; - New output format --- The new output format adds another column, `EffectiveLength`, to the output which records the effective length of each transcript.

Integrability,"egust](http://degust.erc.monash.edu/). ; Other improvements, features and changes; -----. * The [multi-threaded read parser used by Salmon](https://github.com/rob-p/FQFeeder) has been updated to considerably improve CPU utilization. Specifically, the previous queue management strategy (busy waiting) has been replaced by an intelligent, bounded, exponential-backoff strategy. Many improvements (and much of the code) comes from [this series of blog posts](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/important-properties-of-spinlocks/) by David Geier. Basically, what this means is that the performance will be the same as the prior implementation if your disks can feed reads to Salmon quickly enough, but if they can't, considerably less CPU time will be wasted waiting on input (i.e. processing speed will be better matched to I/O throughput).; ; * In addition to the improved parser behavior, some of the noisy logger messages in the parser have been eliminated. In ""pathological"" situations with very fast disks and slow CPUs (or vice-versa), the previous parser may have generated an inordinate amount of output, creating large log files and otherwise slowing down processing. This should no longer happen. * Salmon will now terminate early (with a non-zero exit code) and report a meaningful error message if a corrupt input file is detected. Previously, corrupted compressed input files could have caused the parser to hang indefinitely. This behavior was fixed upstream in kseq, and the current parser wraps this detection with a descriptive exception message. * Renamed the `--allowOrphans` flag to `--allowOrphansFMD`, and added a `--discardOrphansQuasi` flag.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: egust](http://degust.erc.monash.edu/). ; Other improvements, features and changes; -----. * The [multi-threaded read parser used by Salmon](https://github.com/rob-p/FQFeeder) has been updated to considerably improve CPU utilization. Specifically, the previous queue management strategy (busy waiting) has been replaced by an intelligent, bounded, exponential-backoff strategy. Many improvements (and much of the code) comes from [this series of blog posts](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/important-properties-of-spinlocks/) by David Geier. Basically, what this means is that the performance will be the same as the prior implementation if your disks can feed reads to Salmon quickly enough, but if they can't, considerably less CPU time will be wasted waiting on input (i.e. processing speed will be better matched to I/O throughput).; ; * In addition to the improved parser behavior, some of the noisy logger messages in the parser have been eliminated. In ""pathological"" situations with very fast disks and slow CPUs (or vice-versa), the previous parser may have generated an inordinate amount of output, creating large log files and otherwise slowing down processing. This should no longer happen. * Salmon will now terminate early (with a non-zero exit code) and report a meaningful error message if a corrupt input file is detected. Previously, corrupted compressed input files could have caused the parser to hang indefinitely. This behavior was fixed upstream in kseq, and the current parser wraps this detection with a descriptive exception message. * Renamed the `--allowOrphans` flag to `--allowOrphansFMD`, and added a `--discardOrphansQuasi` flag. This is a bit messy currently (the default in FMD mapping is to discard orphans and in quasi-mapping is to keep them). These flags to the obvious things and are docuemented more in the command line help. We are considering how best to clean-up simplify these flags in future releases. * Many other small improvements and bug fixes.

Integrability,"the new default `quasi index` essentially obviates the previous perfect-hash-based index. Specifically, since that perfect hash also stored the keys (to validate queries from outside the universe on which the hash was built), the size of the resulting index was similar, it simply required less memory to build. However, sparsepp achieves very similar memory usage to the previous perfect-hash-based index. Instead of removing the perfect-hash-based index entirely, the `-p/--perfectHash` flag now tells the `quasiindex` command to build a _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index. This index uses a number of aggressive space-saving techniques which results in a much smaller memory footprint (but it is also slower to construct and has slower lookups than the default index). For large references, the new _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index exhibits a memory reduction (_over the new, reduced-memory, default index_) of 40-50% (hence, it shows close to this savings over the old perfect-hash-based index as well). Also, for large references, the size of the index on disk is ~40% smaller. The cost of this substantial size reduction is that the _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index takes 2-2.5 times longer to build, and lookups are slower. This slower lookup speed can, conceivably, reduce quasi-mapping speed a bit, but the speed hit (if there is one) is dataset dependent. This new indexing scheme should allow the construction of `quasi` indices on substantially larger references for a fixed RAM budget, and also reduces the memory required to retain the index in memory during mapping as well. _Note_: This type of index is specifically recommended if you need to build an index on a large set of targets (e.g., for metagenomic or microbiomic use). # References. <a name=""mmseq"">[1]</a> Haplotype and isoform specific expression estimation using multi-mapping RNA-seq reads.

Modifiability,"New features & improvements; ---------------------------. * This release includes a refactoring and optimization of the mapping code in `--sketch` mode, further increasing speed; output should remain identical. * This release adds the `--splitSeqV1` and `--splitSeqV2` flags, that have been the development release for a bit, as simple alternatives to custom geometry when processing SPLiT-seq data for `alevin-fry` or `alevin` processing. Fixes; -----. * No particular bug fixes are noted for this release. Other changes / enhancements; -------------------------------. * Explicitly check for valid value of `k` before calling out to the indexer. This leads to a more informative error message and exit if the user passes an unacceptable value of `k`. . Notes; -----. * The `Intel TBB` library used internally by `salmon` (and used as well in `TwoPaCo` that is relied upon for compacted reference de Bruijn graph construction) has evolved into the [`oneAPI TBB`](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB). Recent releases of this library (2021.1 and forward) make certain backward incompatible changes and therefore cannot be used to build `salmon`.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: New features & improvements; ---------------------------. * This release includes a refactoring and optimization of the mapping code in `--sketch` mode, further increasing speed; output should remain identical. * This release adds the `--splitSeqV1` and `--splitSeqV2` flags, that have been the development release for a bit, as simple alternatives to custom geometry when processing SPLiT-seq data for `alevin-fry` or `alevin` processing. Fixes; -----. * No particular bug fixes are noted for this release. Other changes / enhancements; -------------------------------. * Explicitly check for valid value of `k` before calling out to the indexer. This leads to a more informative error message and exit if the user passes an unacceptable value of `k`. . Notes; -----. * The `Intel TBB` library used internally by `salmon` (and used as well in `TwoPaCo` that is relied upon for compacted reference de Bruijn graph construction) has evolved into the [`oneAPI TBB`](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB). Recent releases of this library (2021.1 and forward) make certain backward incompatible changes and therefore cannot be used to build `salmon`. We anticipate working toward replacing the deprecated and removed functions with the corresponding `oneAPI` replacements and idioms, hopefully in the next release of `salmon`. Therefore, we anticipate that this will be the last — or close to the last —`salmon` release to use (and be compatible with) the legacy `Intel TBB` library. Future releases will likely require a newer version of the `oneAPI TBB` library instead. **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0

After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster.

Alevin-fry is computationally efficient, flexible, and _very_ memory efficient, *processing single-cell experiments in 2-3GB of memory* (see more details in the [poster](https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Accurate_efficient_and_uncertainty-aware_expression_quantification_of_single-cell_RNA-seq_data/13198100/1) introducing alevin-fry). Moving forward, we plan for alevin-fry to be the primary development platform for new single-cell quantification methods. Nonetheless, [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry) currently, and for the forseeable future, will rely on alevin to perform the actual barcode / umi extraction, and mapping of sequencing reads. alevin communicates with alevin-fry via an intermediate binary file called a RAD (Reduced Alignment Data) file. To process data with alevin-fry (documentation available [here](https://alevin-fry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), you must first map the reads to the reference transcriptome to generate a RAD file. This is done by running alevin as you would normally do, and by additionally passing the flag `--rad` or `--just

This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed.

The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000).

Content: ly changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly.

Content: t this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed. Instead, salmon would refuse to index these sequences until the duplicate decoys were removed. Since indexing duplicate sequences does not make any sense, we have decided that duplicate decoy sequences will _always_ be discarded (regardless of the status of the `--keepDuplicates` flag). This lifts the burden on the user of having to ensure that the decoy sequences are free of duplicates. The behavior can now be described as: ""If a decoy sequence is a duplicate of any previously-observed sequence, it is discarded, regardless of the status of the --keepDuplicates flag."" This applie

On these systems, ""/dev/urandom"" is explicitly substituted for the default random device. Unfortunately, it is not possible / easy to make the appropriate source changes at runtime. So, if you are experiencing this issue (which, again, looks to be exceedingly rare), it may be best to compile from source on the machine causing the issue. ## salmon-related changes. * salmon should now compile and run on ARM machines. It has been tested on an AWS aarch64 node (running Ubuntu 20.10), but presumably should work on many ARM machines. *It is assumed that NEON intrinsics are available*. This support for ARM was made immensely easier by [SIMDe](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde). Thanks to @mr-c and @BenLangmead for pointing out SIMDe project and to @mr-c, @lh3 and lead developer of SIMDe @nemequ who all gave useful advice on the initial expansion to ARM support. ## alevin-related changes. ### Support for RAD file creation and the alevin-fry pipeline. * `--rad`/`--justAlign` **flag** : Salmon/alevin 1.4.0 coincides with the initial release of [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), a flexible and efficient framework for single-cell quantification.

This is more permissive than the default strategy which would require the overhaning bases of the read to be scored as a deletion under the alignment. * There is a new command-line flag `--hitFilterPolicy` which determines the policy by which hits or chains of hits are filtered in selective alignment, prior to alignment scoring. Filtering hits after chaining (the default) is more sensitive, but more computationally intensive, because it performs the chaining dynamic program for all hits. Filtering before chaining is faster, but some true hits may be missed. The NONE option is not recommended, but is the most sensitive. It does not filter any chains based on score, though all methods only retain the highest-scoring chains per transcript for subsequent alignment score. The options are BEFORE, AFTER, BOTH and NONE. * There is a new command-line flag `--fullLengthAlignment`, which performs selective-alignment over the full length of the read, beginning from the (approximate) initial mapping location and using extension alignment. This is in contrast with the default behavior which is to only perform alignment between the MEMs in the optimal chain (and before the first and after the last MEM if applicable). The default strategy forces the MEMs to belong to the alignment, but has the benefit that it can discover indels prior to the first hit shared between the read and reference. * The `-d/--du

Performance,"Map](#rapmap-features); - New hash map for default index - The default `quasiindex` command now uses the [sparsepp](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) sparse hash map. While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map.

Performance,"Salmon 0.10.0 is a _major feature_ release. It includes a family of algorithms to perform single cell analysis, but also a number of new feature and performance enhancements.

The alevin mode is activated by using the `alevin` command, and currently supports quantification of [Drop-seq](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415005498) (`--dropseq`) and [10x v1/2](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14049) (`--chromium`) single-cell protocols (v1 chemistry requires use of a special wrapper). Alevin works on raw-FASTA/Q files and performs the following tasks:. * _Intial Whitelisting_: If not given `--whitelist` (an already known set of whitelisted barcodes e.g. as produced by Cell Ranger), alevin finds a rough estimate for the set of the whitelisted CB (Cellular Barcodes) based on their frequency. * _Barcode Correction_: In the first pass over the CB file, alevin constructs a dictionary for the correction of CB (if not on the whitelist) by correcting CB within 1-edit distance of the whitelisted CB. In case of multiple whitelist candidates, preference is given to `SNP` over `indels`. Optionally, a probabilistic model can be used to soft-assign barcodes, although that behavior is disabled by default. (`--noSoftMap` is `true` ). * _UMI Correction & Deduplication_: alevin introduces a novel method for deduplicating the UMIs (Unique Molecule identifiers) present in a sample. Alevin's algorithm uses equivalence-class-level information to infer when the same UMI must arise from different isoforms of a gene (to ",perform,MatchSource.RELEASES,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.10.0:82,perform,82,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.10.0,3,['perform'],"['perform', 'performance']","The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: Salmon 0.10.0 is a _major feature_ release. It includes a family of algorithms to perform single cell analysis, but also a number of new feature and performance enhancements. We highly-recommend that all users upgrade when they have the chance. . _Note_ : Due to the inclusion of the SHA512 hash in the salmon index (see in [other changes](#other-changes) below), existing salmon indices should be rebuilt. ## alevin. _Welcome alevin to the salmon family !_; ; Working under the salmon engine, alevin brings new algorithms and infrastructure to perform single-cell quantification and analysis based on 3' tagged-end sequencing. The alevin mode is activated by using the `alevin` command, and currently supports quantification of [Drop-seq](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415005498) (`--dropseq`) and [10x v1/2](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14049) (`--chromium`) single-cell protocols (v1 chemistry requires use of a special wrapper). Alevin works on raw-FASTA/Q files and performs the following tasks:. * _Intial Whitelisting_: If not given `--whitelist` (an already known set of whitelisted barcodes e.g. as produced by Cell Ranger), alevin finds a rough estimate for the set of the whitelisted CB (Cellular Barcodes) based on their frequency. * _Barcode Correction_: In the first pass over the CB file, alevin constructs a dictionary for the correction of CB (if not on the whitelist) by correcting CB within 1-edit distance of the whitelisted CB. In case of multiple whitelist candidates, preference is given to `SNP` over `indels`. Optionally, a probabilistic model can be used to soft-assign barcodes, although that behavior is disabled by default. (`--noSoftMap` is `true` ). * _UMI Correction & Deduplication_: alevin introduces a novel method for deduplicating the UMIs (Unique Molecule identifiers) present in a sample. Alevin's algorithm uses equivalence-class-level information to infer when the same UMI must arise from different isoforms of a gene (to

To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line.

Alevin works on raw-FASTA/Q files and performs the following tasks:. * _Intial Whitelisting_: If not given `--whitelist` (an already known set of whitelisted barcodes e.g. as produced by Cell Ranger), alevin finds a rough estimate for the set of the whitelisted CB (Cellular Barcodes) based on their frequency. * _Barcode Correction_: In the first pass over the CB file, alevin constructs a dictionary for the correction of CB (if not on the whitelist) by correcting CB within 1-edit distance of the whitelisted CB. In case of multiple whitelist candidates, preference is given to `SNP` over `indels`. Optionally, a probabilistic model can be used to soft-assign barcodes, although that behavior is disabled by default. (`--noSoftMap` is `true` ). * _UMI Correction & Deduplication_: alevin introduces a novel method for deduplicating the UMIs (Unique Molecule identifiers) present in a sample.

Performance,"s constraint in future releases. *As always*, a pre-compiled linux executable is included below and the latest release is available via Bioconda. ## Improvements. * SHA512 sums are now properly propagated forward to `meta_info.json`. * Bumped the included version of the [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) serialization library. The components used by salmon _should_ be backward compatible in terms of reading output from the previous version (i.e. should not require index re-building). * The flag `--keepFixedFasta` was added to the `index` command. If this flag is passed, then a ""fixed"" version of the fasta file will be retained in the index directory. This file is created during indexing, but is normally deleted when indexing is complete. It contains the input fasta without duplicate sequences (unless `--keepDuplicates` was used), with the headers as understood by salmon, with `N` nucleotides replaced, etc. * Introduced a few small optimizations upstream (in pufferfish) to speed up selective-alignment; more are on the way (thanks to @mohsenzakeri). ## Bug fixes. * The bug described directly below led to the discovery of a _different_ but related bug that could cause the extracted sequence used for bias correction to be incorrect.

Content: s constraint in future releases. *As always*, a pre-compiled linux executable is included below and the latest release is available via Bioconda. ## Improvements. * SHA512 sums are now properly propagated forward to `meta_info.json`. * Bumped the included version of the [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) serialization library. The components used by salmon _should_ be backward compatible in terms of reading output from the previous version (i.e. should not require index re-building). * The flag `--keepFixedFasta` was added to the `index` command. If this flag is passed, then a ""fixed"" version of the fasta file will be retained in the index directory. This file is created during indexing, but is normally deleted when indexing is complete. It contains the input fasta without duplicate sequences (unless `--keepDuplicates` was used), with the headers as understood by salmon, with `N` nucleotides replaced, etc. * Introduced a few small optimizations upstream (in pufferfish) to speed up selective-alignment; more are on the way (thanks to @mohsenzakeri). ## Bug fixes. * The bug described directly below led to the discovery of a _different_ but related bug that could cause the extracted sequence used for bias correction to be incorrect. The code was assuming zero-initalization of memory which was not necessarily occuring. **Note**: This bug affects runs performed under mapping-based mode (i.e. when the input was not coming from a BAM file) and when `--seqBias` or `--gcBias` flags (or both) were used.

Using the `--validateMappings` flag has two main potential benefits. First, this will help prevent salmon from considering potentially spurious mappings (i.e., mappings supported by only a few MMPs but which nonetheless would not support a high-quality read alignment). Second, this will help assign more appropriate mapping scores to reads that map to similar (but not identical) reference sequences --- essentially helping to appropriately down-weight sub-optimal mappings. Along with this flag, salmon introduces flags to set the match score (`--ma`), mismatch penalty (`--mp`), and gap open (`--go`) and extension (`--ge`) scores used when computing the alignment.

The format of this file is to provide one target name per-line, in a newline separated file. Unlike decoy sequences, this list of sequences is provided to the `quant` command, and can be different between different runs if so-desired. Also, unlike decoy sequences, the auxiliary targets _will_ be quantified (e.g. they will have entries in `quant.sf` and can have reads assigned to them). To aid in metadata tracking of targets marked as auxiliary, the `aux_info` directory contains a new file `aux_target_ids.json`, which contains a json file listing the indices of targets that were treated as ""auxiliary"" targets in the current run. * The equivalence class output is now gzipped when written (and written to `aux_info/eq_classes.txt.gz` rather than `aux_info/eq_classes.txt`). To detect this behavior, an extra property `gzipped` is written to the `eq_class_properties` entry of `aux_info/meta_info.json`.

To aid in metadata tracking of targets marked as auxiliary, the `aux_info` directory contains a new file `aux_target_ids.json`, which contains a json file listing the indices of targets that were treated as ""auxiliary"" targets in the current run. * The equivalence class output is now gzipped when written (and written to `aux_info/eq_classes.txt.gz` rather than `aux_info/eq_classes.txt`). To detect this behavior, an extra property `gzipped` is written to the `eq_class_properties` entry of `aux_info/meta_info.json`. Apart from being gzipped to save space, however, the format is unchanged. So, you can simply read the file using a gzip stream, or, alternatively, simply unzip the file before reading it. * Added special handling for reading SAM files that were, themselves, produced by `salmon`. Specifically, when reading SAM files produced by salmon, the `AS` tag will be used to assign appropriate conditional probabilities to different mappings for a fragment (rather than looking for a CIGAR string, which is not computed). * The `versionInfo.json` file generated during indexing now remember the specific version of salmon that was used to build the index. The `indexVersion` field is already a version identifier that is incremented when the index changes in a binary-incompatible way. However, the new field will allow one to know the exact salmon version that was used to build the index. . ### alevin. * A couple of new flags has been add

The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters.

This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants.

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: This is a minor release, but it nonetheless adds a few important features and fixes an outstanding bug. This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`.

While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map. For more details on the performance characteristics of the new default hash used in the index, please see the sparsepp benchmarks [here](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/blob/master/bench.md).; - New **frugal** perfect hash index - The vastly improved memory usage of the new default `quasi index` essentially obviates the previous perfect-hash-based index. Specifically, since that perfect hash also stored the keys (to validate queries from outside the universe on which the hash was built), the size of the resulting index was similar, it simply required less memory to build. However, sparsepp achieves very similar memory usage to the previ",hash,MatchSource.RELEASES,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.8.0:4620,hash,4620,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.8.0,1,['hash'],['hash'],"The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access.

This option enforces that a certain fraction of the _read_ is covered by exact matches (specifically, maximum mappable prefixes) in order to consider a mapping as valid. The value is expressed as a number between 0 and 1; a larger value is more stringent, and less likely to allow spurious mappings, but can reduce sensitivity.; ; ## [New features due to changes and improvements in RapMap](#rapmap-features); - New hash map for default index - The default `quasiindex` command now uses the [sparsepp](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) sparse hash map. While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map. For more details on the performance characteristics of the new default hash used in the index, please see the sparsepp benchmarks [here](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/blob/master/bench.md).; - New **frugal** perfect hash index - The vastly improved memory usage of the new default `quasi index` essentially obviates the previous perfect-hash-based index. Specifically, since that perfect hash also stored the keys (to validate queries from outside the universe on which the hash was built), the size of the resulting index was similar, it simply required less memory to build. However, sparsepp achieves very similar memory usage to the previ

The older behavior can be obtained by setting `--incompatPrior` to a small non-zero value. * The library format count statistics are now computed in a different (and hopefully less confusing) manner. Specifically, rather than being computed over the number of _mappings_ of each type, the statistics are computed over the number of fragments that have at least one mapping of that type. This means that, e.g., if a fragment maps to 2 places in the forward orientation and 1 place in the reverse-complement orientation, this will now contribute only 1 count to the forward and reverse-complement compatibilites each.

Specifically, since that perfect hash also stored the keys (to validate queries from outside the universe on which the hash was built), the size of the resulting index was similar, it simply required less memory to build. However, sparsepp achieves very similar memory usage to the previous perfect-hash-based index. Instead of removing the perfect-hash-based index entirely, the `-p/--perfectHash` flag now tells the `quasiindex` command to build a _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index. This index uses a number of aggressive space-saving techniques which results in a much smaller memory footprint (but it is also slower to construct and has slower lookups than the default index). For large references, the new _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index exhibits a memory reduction (_over the new, reduced-memory, default index_) of 40-50% (hence, it shows close to this savings over the old perfect-hash-based index as well). Also, for large references, the size of the index on disk is ~40% smaller. The cost of this substantial size reduction is that the _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index takes 2-2.5 times longer to build, and lookups are slower. This slower lookup speed can, conceivably, reduce quasi-mapping speed a bit, but the speed hit (if there is one) is dataset dependent. This new indexing scheme should allow the construction of `quasi` indices on substantially larger references for a fixed RAM budget, and also reduces the memory required to retain the index in memory during mapping as well. _Note_: This type of index is specifically recommended if you need to build an index on a large set of targets (e.g., for metagenomic or microbiomic use). # References. <a name=""mmseq"">[1]</a> Haplotype and isoform specific expression estimation using multi-mapping RNA-seq reads.

While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys.

Security,"Release Notes; ================. Major Release (including major updates to Alevin and improvements to mapping validation); ------------. We are very excited to release a major upgrade to the single-cell framework of the Salmon tool --- Alevin. Alevin is a droplet based single-cell RNA-seq data quantification tool which currently supports the following protocols:. 1. Drop-seq; 2. 10x-Chromium v2 (v1 via wrapper); 3. 10x-Chromimum v3; 4. CEL-Seq2. With the latest release, the UMI deduplication step has been completely changed, and it is now driven by a new, efficient and robust algorithm. The latest algorithm, instead of discarding gene-ambiguous reads, utilizes the UMI networks generated by transcript level equivalence classes to better deduplicate the UMIs; while still correcting for UMI collisions. We also show that including the gene ambiguous reads into the analyses significantly improves the accuracy of the quantification of the gene count matrix in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000). Moreover, Alevin introduces a new categorization of the genes into informative tiers, allowing concise assessment of the quality of evidence that led to each UMI count in each cell. Along with many other minor bug fixes, the latest release adds two more ways of selecting an initial whitelist for starting the Alevin pipeline more robustly. New Flags and Features for Alevin:; ------------. * Along with already present customizable CB and UMI length command line flags, Alevin now support two more single-cell protocols without explicit configuration. `--chromiumV3` for v3 chemistry of 10x data, works same as v2 chemistry except the UMI length has been increased from 10 to 12. `--celseq2` for CelSeq2 data where both CB and UMI length by default has been configured to 6. * Alevin, with the latest release, would be using `--validateMapping` and `--minScoreFraction` w/ value 0.8 as the default (although tweakble), mapping based option.

Security,"ents / tags deriving from a target are assumed to be independent of that target's length. (This feature is still experimental, and requires more testing, so please provide feedback if you use it).; - Added new `--quasiCoverage` option. This is analogous to the `--coverage` option, but the latter applies only to mapping under the FMD-based index (which is no longer recommended). This option enforces that a certain fraction of the _read_ is covered by exact matches (specifically, maximum mappable prefixes) in order to consider a mapping as valid. The value is expressed as a number between 0 and 1; a larger value is more stringent, and less likely to allow spurious mappings, but can reduce sensitivity.; ; ## [New features due to changes and improvements in RapMap](#rapmap-features); - New hash map for default index - The default `quasiindex` command now uses the [sparsepp](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) sparse hash map. While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map. For more details on the performance characteristics of the new default hash used in the index, please see the sparsepp benchmarks [here](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/blob/master/bench.md).; - New **frugal** perfect hash index - The vastly improved memory usage of the new default `quasi index` essent",hash,MatchSource.RELEASES,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.8.0:4335,hash,4335,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.8.0,1,['hash'],['hash'],"The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access.

(This feature is still experimental, and requires more testing, so please provide feedback if you use it).; - Added new `--quasiCoverage` option. This is analogous to the `--coverage` option, but the latter applies only to mapping under the FMD-based index (which is no longer recommended). This option enforces that a certain fraction of the _read_ is covered by exact matches (specifically, maximum mappable prefixes) in order to consider a mapping as valid. The value is expressed as a number between 0 and 1; a larger value is more stringent, and less likely to allow spurious mappings, but can reduce sensitivity.; ; ## [New features due to changes and improvements in RapMap](#rapmap-features); - New hash map for default index - The default `quasiindex` command now uses the [sparsepp](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) sparse hash map. While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map. For more details on the performance characteristics of the new default hash used in the index, please see the sparsepp benchmarks [here](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/blob/master/bench.md).; - New **frugal** perfect hash index - The vastly improved memory usage of the new default `quasi index` essent

Content: ing based on protocols (e.g., Lexogen Quantseq) where the number of sequenced fragments / tags deriving from a target are assumed to be independent of that target's length. (This feature is still experimental, and requires more testing, so please provide feedback if you use it).; - Added new `--quasiCoverage` option. This is analogous to the `--coverage` option, but the latter applies only to mapping under the FMD-based index (which is no longer recommended). This option enforces that a certain fraction of the _read_ is covered by exact matches (specifically, maximum mappable prefixes) in order to consider a mapping as valid. The value is expressed as a number between 0 and 1; a larger value is more stringent, and less likely to allow spurious mappings, but can reduce sensitivity.; ; ## [New features due to changes and improvements in RapMap](#rapmap-features); - New hash map for default index - The default `quasiindex` command now uses the [sparsepp](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) sparse hash map. While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map. For more details on the performance characteristics of the new default hash used in the index, please see the sparsepp benchmarks [here](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/blob/master/bench.md).; - New **frugal** perfect has

Content: paired-end reads. If passed this flag, salmon will not consider dovetailing mappings as discordant, and will consider them. . * The following fields have been added to `meta_info.json`:; * `num_dovetail_fragments` : which denotes the number of fragments that have _only_ dovetailing mappings. If the `--allowDovetail` flag was passed, these are counted toward quantification, otherwise they are discarded (but this number is still reported). This field only has a meaningful value in quasi-mapping mode (with or without mapping validation).; * `num_fragments_filtered_vm` : which denotes the number of fragments that had a mapping to the transcriptome, but which were discarded because _none_ of the mappings for the fragments exceeded the minimum mapping validation score. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0).; * `num_alignments_below_threshold_for_mapped_fragments_vm` : which denotes the number of _mappings_ discarded because they failed to reach the minimum mapping validation score, but for which the corresponding fragment had at least a single valid mapping. This field only has a meaningful value in conjunction with mapping validation (otherwise it is 0). ## Previous Salmon 0.13.0 release notes. ## Change to default behavior. Starting from this version of salmon, dovetailed mappings (see the [Bowtie2 manual](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#mates-can-overlap-contain-or-dovetail-each-other) for a description) are _not_ accepted by default using the built-in mapping (with or without `--validateMappings`). Moreover v0.13.0 has no flag to allow dovetail mappings. The `--allowDovetail` option has been added to v0.13.1 to enable this behavior, if desired. Exotic library types (e.g. MU, MSF, MSR) are no longer supported. If you need support for such a library type, please submit a feature request describing the use-case. ## Improvements and new flags.

Specifically, rather than being computed over the number of _mappings_ of each type, the statistics are computed over the number of fragments that have at least one mapping of that type. This means that, e.g., if a fragment maps to 2 places in the forward orientation and 1 place in the reverse-complement orientation, this will now contribute only 1 count to the forward and reverse-complement compatibilites each. This should help reduce any reference bias when computing these summary statistics. * The default value of `--gcSpeedSamp` has been set to 5. * Inclusion of SHA512 hashes for the salmon index : When indexing salmon now computes both SHA256 and SHA512 indices for the reference. This is done to allow future-compatibility with GA4GH hashes (which will use a truncated variant of SHA512). * The default k-mer class (used for certain operations within salmon) has been migrated from the jellyfish implementation to a custom implementation.

Content: sing) manner. Specifically, rather than being computed over the number of _mappings_ of each type, the statistics are computed over the number of fragments that have at least one mapping of that type. This means that, e.g., if a fragment maps to 2 places in the forward orientation and 1 place in the reverse-complement orientation, this will now contribute only 1 count to the forward and reverse-complement compatibilites each. This should help reduce any reference bias when computing these summary statistics. * The default value of `--gcSpeedSamp` has been set to 5. * Inclusion of SHA512 hashes for the salmon index : When indexing salmon now computes both SHA256 and SHA512 indices for the reference. This is done to allow future-compatibility with GA4GH hashes (which will use a truncated variant of SHA512). * The default k-mer class (used for certain operations within salmon) has been migrated from the jellyfish implementation to a custom implementation.

Security,"would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map. For more details on the performance characteristics of the new default hash used in the index, please see the sparsepp benchmarks [here](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/blob/master/bench.md).; - New **frugal** perfect hash index - The vastly improved memory usage of the new default `quasi index` essentially obviates the previous perfect-hash-based index. Specifically, since that perfect hash also stored the keys (to validate queries from outside the universe on which the hash was built), the size of the resulting index was similar, it simply required less memory to build. However, sparsepp achieves very similar memory usage to the previous perfect-hash-based index. Instead of removing the perfect-hash-based index entirely, the `-p/--perfectHash` flag now tells the `quasiindex` command to build a _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index. This index uses a number of aggressive space-saving techniques which results in a much smaller memory footprint (but it is also slower to construct and has slower lookups than the default index). For large references, the new _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index exhibits a memory reduction (_over the new, reduced-memory, default index_) of 40-50% (hence, it shows close to this savings over the old perfect-hash-based index as well). Also, for large references, the size of the index on disk is ~40% smaller. The cost of this substantial size reduction is that the _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index takes 2-2.5 times longer to build, and lookups are slower. This slower lookup speed can, conceivably, reduce quasi-mapping speed a bit, but the speed hit (if there is one) is dataset dep",hash,MatchSource.RELEASES,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.8.0:5689,hash-based,5689,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v0.8.0,1,['hash'],['hash-based'],"The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access.

This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map. For more details on the performance characteristics of the new default hash used in the index, please see the sparsepp benchmarks [here](https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/blob/master/bench.md).; - New **frugal** perfect hash index - The vastly improved memory usage of the new default `quasi index` essentially obviates the previous perfect-hash-based index. Specifically, since that perfect hash also stored the keys (to validate queries from outside the universe on which the hash was built), the size of the resulting index was similar, it simply required less memory to build. However, sparsepp achieves very similar memory usage to the previous perfect-hash-based index. Instead of removing the perfect-hash-based index entirely, the `-p/--perfectHash` flag now tells the `quasiindex` command to build a _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index. This index uses a number of aggressive space-saving techniques which results in a much smaller memory footprint (but it is also slower to construct and has slower lookups than the default index). For large references, the new _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index exhibits a memory reduction (_over the new, reduced-memory, default index_) of 40-50% (hence, it shows close to this savings over the old perfect-hash-based index as well). Also, for large references, the size of the index on disk is ~40% smaller. The cost of this substantial size reduction is that the _frugal_ perfect-hash-based index takes 2-2.5 times longer to build, and lookups are slower. This slower lookup speed can, conceivably, reduce quasi-mapping speed a bit, but the speed hit (if there is one) is dataset dep

This flag attempts to mimic the *very* strict mapping parameters with which Bowtie2 is invoked when it is used with RSEM. Specifically, it disallows orphans, indels in alignments, and dovetailing reads. It also sets the minimum score fraction (`--minScoreFraction`) to 0.8. We do *not* generally recommend using this flag, as these parameters tend to be overly strict and can eliminate many valid mappings / alignments.

Testability,"# salmon 1.1.0 release notes. **Note** : This version contains some important fixes, please see below for detailed information. **Note** : On our testing machines, this version of salmon was _index_-compatible with version 1.0.0. That is, it is likely that you need not re-build your index from what you built with 1.0.0. However, it is not clear that this compatibility is guaranteed by the cereal library. If you encounter difficulty loading a previously-built index, please consider re-building with the latest version before filing a bug report. **Note** : If you want to build from source and use a version of the (header-only) cereal library already installed on your system, please make sure it is cereal v1.3.0. The current `findCereal.cmake` file does not support version restrictions, and we are working to improve this for proper automatic detection and enforcement of this constraint in future releases. *As always*, a pre-compiled linux executable is included below and the latest release is available via Bioconda. ## Improvements. * SHA512 sums are now properly propagated forward to `meta_info.json`. * Bumped the included version of the [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) serialization library.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: # salmon 1.1.0 release notes. **Note** : This version contains some important fixes, please see below for detailed information. **Note** : On our testing machines, this version of salmon was _index_-compatible with version 1.0.0. That is, it is likely that you need not re-build your index from what you built with 1.0.0. However, it is not clear that this compatibility is guaranteed by the cereal library. If you encounter difficulty loading a previously-built index, please consider re-building with the latest version before filing a bug report. **Note** : If you want to build from source and use a version of the (header-only) cereal library already installed on your system, please make sure it is cereal v1.3.0. The current `findCereal.cmake` file does not support version restrictions, and we are working to improve this for proper automatic detection and enforcement of this constraint in future releases. *As always*, a pre-compiled linux executable is included below and the latest release is available via Bioconda. ## Improvements. * SHA512 sums are now properly propagated forward to `meta_info.json`. * Bumped the included version of the [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) serialization library. The components used by salmon _should_ be backward compatible in terms of reading output from the previous version (i.e. should not require index re-building). * The flag `--keepFixedFasta` was added to the `index` command. If this flag is passed, then a ""fixed"" version of the fasta file will be retained in the index directory. This file is created during indexing, but is normally deleted when indexing is complete. It contains the input fasta without duplicate sequences (unless `--keepDuplicates` was used), with the headers as understood by salmon, with `N` nucleotides replaced, etc. * Introduced a few small optimizations upstream (in pufferfish) to speed up selective-alignment; more are on the way (thanks to @mohsenzakeri). ## Bug fixes. * The bug described directly be

While providing very similar lookup performance to the prior hash map implementation, sparsepp provides a number of benefits. Specifically, it uses _substantially_ less memory (typically ~50% less) and, crucially, the memory usage grows gradually with the number of keys. A big problem with the previous implementation being used (Google's dense hash map) is that, on resize, the map would double and memory usage would jump by a factor of 3 (a new map of twice the size as the old, plus the original map from which to copy the keys). This means that even if you had enough memory to hold the final map, you might not be able to build it. Sparsepp, on the other hand exhibits memory usage that scales almost linearly with the number of items in the map.

Testability,"This is a major stable release of salmon and brings a lot of exciting new features with extensive benchmarking in the latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). This new version of salmon is based on a fundamentally different indexing data structure ([pufferfish](http://bit.ly/2m1OSr3)) than the previous version. It also adopts a different mapping algorithm; a variant of selective-alignment. The new indexing data structure makes it possible to index the transcriptome as well as a large amount of ""decoy"" sequence in small memory. It also makes it possible to index the _entire transcriptome_ **and** _the entire genome_ in ""reasonable"" memory (currently ~18G in `dense` mode and ~14G in `sparse` mode, though these sizes may improve in the future), which provides a much more comprehensive set of potential decoy sequences. In the new index, the transcriptome and genome are on ""equal footing"", which helps to avoid bias toward either the transcriptome or the genome during mapping. **Note** : To construct the ccDBG from the reference sequence, which is subsequently indexed with pufferfish, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [TwoPaCo software](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/TwoPaCo). TwoPaCo implements a very efficient algorithm for building a ccDBG from a collection of reference sequences. One of the key parameters of TwoPaCo is the size of the Bloom filter used to record and filter possible junction k-mers. To ease the indexing procedure, salmon will attempt to automatically set a reasonable estimate for the Bloom filter size, based on an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers in the reference and using a default FPR of 0.1% over TwoPaCo's default 5 filters. To quickly obtain an estimate of the number of distinct k-mers, salmon makes use of (a _very slightly modified_ version of) the [ntCard software](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard); specifically the `nthll` implementation. . ## Changes since v0.99.0 beta2; A bug r",benchmark,MatchSource.RELEASES,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.0.0:98,benchmarking,98,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.0.0,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking'],"The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection.

Through broad benchmarking across many samples, we have worked to considerably improve the algorithm and its sensitivity. **We note** that it is likely that mapping validation will turned on by _default_ in future releases, and we strongly encourage all users to make use of this feature and report their experiences with it. Along with the default mapping validation (enabled via `--validateMappings`), there are two ""meta"" flags that enable mapping validation parameters meant to mimic configurations in which users might be interested. . * `--mimicBT2` : This flag is a ""meta-flag"" that sets the parameters related to mapping and mapping validation to mimic alignment using Bowtie2 (with the flags `--no-discordant` and `--no-mixed`), but using the default scoring scheme and allowing both mismatches and indels in alignments. * `--mimicStrictBT2` : This flag is a ""meta-flag"" that sets the parameters related to mapping and mapping validation to mimic alignment using Bowtie2 (with the flags suggested by [RSEM](http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/rsem-c

This improvement comes from (1) fixing a bug that was resulting in an unnecessarily-large allocation when ""pufferizing"" the output of TwoPaCo and (2) improving the storage of some intermediate data structures used during index construction. These improvements should help reduce the burden of constructing a decoy-aware index with small values of `k`.

A full, end-to-end tutorial is soon-to-follow on the [alevin-tutorial](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/) website. ### New flags and options:; ----. * Salmon learned a new option (currently Beta) `--softclip` : This flag allows soft-clipping at the beginning and end of reads when they are scored with selective-alignment.

Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content:  Reduction in the memory required for indexing, especially when indexing with a small value of `k`. This improvement comes from (1) fixing a bug that was resulting in an unnecessarily-large allocation when ""pufferizing"" the output of TwoPaCo and (2) improving the storage of some intermediate data structures used during index construction. These improvements should help reduce the burden of constructing a decoy-aware index with small values of `k`. The issue of reducing the number of intermediate files created (which can hurt performance on NFS-mounted drives) is being worked on upstream, but is not yet resolved. . ### alevin. * This release introduces support for the quantification of CITE-seq / feature barcoding based single-cell protocols! A full, end-to-end tutorial is soon-to-follow on the [alevin-tutorial](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/) website. ### New flags and options:; ----. * Salmon learned a new option (currently Beta) `--softclip` : This flag allows soft-clipping at the beginning and end of reads when they are scored with selective-alignment. If used in conjunction with the `--writeMappings` flag, then the CIGAR strings in the resulting SAM output will designate any soft-clipping that occurs at the beginning or end of the read. *Note:* To pass the selective-alignment filter, the read must still obtain a score of at least `maximum achievable score * minScoreFraction`, but softclipping allows omitting a poor quality sub-alignment at the beginning or end of the read with no change to the resulting score for the rest of the alignment (rather than forcing a negative score for these sub-alignments). * Salmon learned a new option `--decoyThreshold <thresh>`: For an alignemnt to an annotated transcript to be considered invalid, it must have an alignment score `s` such that `s < (decoyThreshold * bestDecoyScore)`. A value of 1.0 means that any alignment strictly worse than the best decoy alignment will be discarded. A smaller value will allow rea

Usability," Sequence lines (`@SQ` lines) that correspond to valid targets contain the tag `DS:T`, while those corresponding to decoys contain the tag `DS:D`. **Note**: In alignment-based mode, salmon will not process SAM/BAM files with decoy entries (to avoid usage errors, since decoy alignment is not intended for quantification). So, if, for some reason you are using a salmon-generated SAM file containing decoy sequences and alignment records, you must remove them before quantifying using alignment-based mode (i.e. removing all headers with `DS:D` and all alignment records with`XT:A:D`). Details about how to perform that transformation can be found [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools#salmon-in-alignment-mode-w-decoy-bam). * This release enables some considerable improvements to speed in the case of aligning poor quality reads. Specifically, this is enabled due to upstream changes in pufferfish implemented by @mohsenzakeri. Now, the aligner can exit early if it becomes clear at any point during alignment that a valid score cannot be obtained. This reduces the computation used to evaluate poor alignments that will not pass subsequent filtering (addresses #527 adn #537). * Homopolymer seeds are now skipped during mapping and alignment. In pathological datasets, this could cause unnecessarily slow mapping without any improvements to the actual mapping rate (i.e. it could generate many poor mappings that would fail alignment). This change can speed up mapping in such datasets (addresses #527 adn #537). * Three new filtering flags have been added to both improve sensitivity and speed.

Usability,"# Salmon 0.14.0 release notes. In addition to the changes and enhancements listed below, this release of salmon implements the decoy-aware selective-alignment strategy described in the manuscript [<ins>Alignment and mapping methodology influence transcript abundance estimation</ins>](http://bit.ly/2Z2Z9kT). For reasons explored in depth in the manuscript, we recommend making use of this decoy-aware selective alignment strategy when not providing pre-aligned reads to salmon. Because of the changes required to implement this indexing strategy, _salmon v0.14.0 is not compatible with the indices of previous versions, and so you must re-build the index for this version of salmon_ (which must be done anyway, if one is adding decoy sequence). ### Adding decoy sequence to the salmon index. . Adding decoy sequence to the salmon index is simple, but salmon is specific about the manner in which the sequence is added. To ease this process, we have created a script that allows the automated creation of a decoy-enhanced transcriptome from a genome FASTA, transcriptome FASTA, and annotation GTF file. The script, as well as detailed instructions on how to run it an use its output, is provided [in the SalmonTools repository](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh). **Note**: Because making effective use of the decoy sequence requires having accurate mapping scores, the decoys are only used when salmon is run with selective alignment (i.e. with the flags `--validateMappings`, `--mimicBT2` or `--mimicStrictBT2`). #### Detailed description of decoy requirements. It is not necessary to use the script we provide to extract decoy sequences, and if you'd like to add your own decoys to the file you wish to index, the process is fairly straightforward.

This release incorporates all of the improvements and additions of 1.2.0, which are significant and which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed.

Usability,"d which are covered in detail [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/tag/v1.2.0). ## New features:. * salmon learned a new command line option `--mismatchSeedSkip`. This option can be used to tune seeding sensitivity for selective-alignment . The default value is 5, and should work well in most cases, but this can be tuned if the user wants. After a k-mer hit is extended to a uni-MEM, the uni-MEM extension can terminate for one of 3 reasons; the end of the read, the end of the unitig, or a mismatch. If the extension ends because of a mismatch, this is likely the result of a sequencing error. To avoid looking up many k-mers that will likely fail to be located in the index, the search procedure skips by a factor of mismatchSeedSkip until it either (1) finds another match or (2) is k-bases past the mismatch position. This value controls that skip length. A smaller value can increase sensitivity, while a larger value can speed up seeding. * salmon learned about the environment variable `SALMON_NO_VERSION_CHECK`. If this environment variable is set (to either `1` or `TRUE`) then salmon will skip checking for an updated version, regardless of whether or not it is passed the `--no-version-check` flag on the command line. This makes it easy to e.g. set the environment variable to control this behavior for instances running on a cluster. This addresses [issue 486](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/486), and we thank @cihanerkut for the suggestion. ## Improvements:. * This is a change in default behavior: As raised in [issue 505](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505), salmon would not index sequence with _duplicate_ decoy entries, unless the `--keepDuplicates` flag was passed. Instead, salmon would refuse to index these sequences until the duplicate decoys were removed.

Passing this flag to alevin (in classic mode; this flag has no effect in RAD mode) stops the pipeline after UMI deduplication and quantification. The second-round intelligent whitelisting operation will not be performed. * **generic barcode / umi / read geometry syntax** : Alevin learned to support a generic syntax to specify the read sequence that should be used for barcodes, UMIs and the read sequence. The syntax allows one to specify how the pattern corresponding to the barcode, UMI, and read sequence should be pieced together, and the syntax is meant to be intuitive and general. For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:; * `--read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]`. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read `2`, and it spans from the first index `1` (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the `end` of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read `1` and occupies positions `1-16`, and the UMI comes from read `1` and occupies positions `17-26`. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify `--bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23]` to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1.

Content: ent or the quasi-mapping algorithm, and prioritizes speed. For an overview of how `--sketch` mode affects downstream results, please check out our poster [Accurate, efficient, and uncertainty-aware expression quantification of single-cell RNA-seq data](https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Accurate_efficient_and_uncertainty-aware_expression_quantification_of_single-cell_RNA-seq_data/13198100/1). ### Other alevin-related changes. * `--noWhitelist` **flag** : Alevin learned the `--noWhitelist` flag. Passing this flag to alevin (in classic mode; this flag has no effect in RAD mode) stops the pipeline after UMI deduplication and quantification. The second-round intelligent whitelisting operation will not be performed. * **generic barcode / umi / read geometry syntax** : Alevin learned to support a generic syntax to specify the read sequence that should be used for barcodes, UMIs and the read sequence. The syntax allows one to specify how the pattern corresponding to the barcode, UMI, and read sequence should be pieced together, and the syntax is meant to be intuitive and general. For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:; * `--read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]`. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read `2`, and it spans from the first index `1` (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the `end` of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read `1` and occupies positions `1-16`, and the UMI comes from read `1` and occupies positions `17-26`. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify `--bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23]` to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1. It is even possible to have the string pieced together across both reads,

Usability,"ere _strictly worse_ than the best decoy alignment. This is equivalent to setting `--decoyThreshold 1.0`, which is the default behavior. * Salmon learned a new option `--minAlnProb <prob>` (default ): When selective alignment is carried out on a read, each alignment A is assigned a probability given by $e^{-(scoreExp * (bestScore - score(A)))}$, where the default `scoreExp` is just 1.0. Depending on how much worse a given alignment is compared to the best alignment for a read, this can result in an exceedingly small alignment probability. The `--minAlnProb` option lets one set the alignment probability below which an alignment's probability will be truncated to 0. This allows skipping the alignments for a fragment that are unlikely to be true (and which could increase the difficulty of inference in some cases). The default value is `1e-5`. * Salmon learned a new flag `--disableChainingHeuristic`: Passing this flag will turn off the heuristic of Li 2018 that is used to speed up the MEM chaining step, where the inner loop of the chaining algorithm is terminated after a small number of previous pointers for a given MEM have been found. Passing this flag can improve the sensitivity of alignment to sequences that are highly repetitive (especially those with overlapping repetition), but it can make the chaining step somewhat slower. * Salmon learned a new flag `--auxTargetFile <file>`. The file passed to this option should be a list of targets (i.e. sequences indexed during indexing, or aligned against in the provided BAM file) for which auxliliary models (sequence-specific, fragment-GC, and position-specific bias correction) _should not_ be applied.

While this is _still_ an ongoing area of research, a considerable amount of testing is suggesting that variational Bayesian optimization with a sparsity inducing prior regularly leads to more accurate abundance estimates than the default EM algorithm.

We encourage users who may not already be doing so to explore the variational Bayesian-based offline optimization feature of salmon (enabled with `--useVBOpt`). * The library type compatibility is now enforced _strictly_. Previously mapping that disagreed with the inferred or provided library type simply had their probability decreased. Now, the default behavior is to discard such mappings. The new behavior is equivalent to running with the option `--incompatPrior 0`. The older behavior can be obtained by setting `--incompatPrior` to a small non-zero value. * The library format count statistics are now computed in a different (and hopefully less confusing) manner. Specifically, rather than being computed over the number of _mappings_ of each type, the statistics are computed over the number of fragments that have at least one mapping of that type. This means that, e.g., if a fragment maps to 2 places in the forward orientation and 1 place in the reverse-complement orientation, this will now contribute only 1 count to the forward and reverse-complement compatibilites each.

While we are leaving the EM algorithm as the default for the offline-phase in the current release, this may change in future versions. We encourage users who may not already be doing so to explore the variational Bayesian-based offline optimization feature of salmon (enabled with `--useVBOpt`). * The library type compatibility is now enforced _strictly_. Previously mapping that disagreed with the inferred or provided library type simply had their probability decreased. Now, the default behavior is to discard such mappings. The new behavior is equivalent to running with the option `--incompatPrior 0`. The older behavior can be obtained by setting `--incompatPrior` to a small non-zero value. * The library format count statistics are now computed in a different (and hopefully less confusing) manner. Specifically, rather than being computed over the number of _mappings_ of each type, the statistics are computed over the number of fragments that have at least one mapping of that type. This means that, e.g., if a fragment maps to 2 places in the forward orientation and 1 place in the reverse-complement orientation, this will now contribute only 1 count to the forward and reverse-complement compatibilites each. This should help reduce any reference bias when computing these summary statistics. * The default value of `--gcSpeedSamp` has been set to 5. * Inclusion of SHA512 hashes for the salmon index
