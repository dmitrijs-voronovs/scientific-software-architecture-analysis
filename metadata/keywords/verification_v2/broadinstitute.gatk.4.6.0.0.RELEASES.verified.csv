Content: a sources that would prevent newer data source versions from being detected as compatible (date comparison error).; * Gencode data sources now have names preserved from config files. (#4823). * `GCNV` kernel tunings (#4720); * Fixed a minor issue in sampling error estimation that could lead to NaN (as a result of division by zero); * Introduced separate internal and external admixing rates; * Introduced two-stage inference for cohort denoising and calling; * Capped phred-scaled qualities to maximum values permitted by machine precision in order to avoid NaNs and overflows.; * Took a first step toward tracking and logging parameters during inference, starting with the ELBO history. * Validation of sequence dictionaries from multiple BAMs now throws warning instead of exception in CNV workflows. (#4758). * `SV tools`; * Tweak BWA to allow ""gappier"" alignments in local assemblies (#4708); * Added a new experimental tool named `CpxVariantReInterprepterSpark` to extract barebone-annotated simple variants from an GATK-SV discovery pipeline produced VCF containing complex variants (#4602); * Fix ""UnhandledCaseSeen"" error in `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` (#4677). * Added new `SingleSequenceReferenceAligner` class to align against an on-the-fly single contig reference using Bwa-Mem (#4780). * Updates to the conda environment for Python-based tools (#4749); * Fix #4741, where newer versions of conda appear to treat relative references in the environment yml as being relative to the yml file instead of relative to the cwd (based on observation).; * Add a second conda yml file (`gatkcondaenv.intel.yml`) for environments that use Intel hardware acceleration and the Intel Tensorflow package (based on #4735).; * Added a gradle task (`condaEnvironmentDefinition`) to generate the conda yml files from a single template to ensure that all the environment definitions remain in sync. This task also generates the Python package archive.; * Added a gradle task (`localDevCond

Deployability,"Highlights of this release include fixes to the GATK4 `HaplotypeCaller` to bring it closer to the output of the GATK3 `HaplotypeCaller` (although many of these fixes still need to be applied to `HaplotypeCallerSpark`), fixes for longstanding indexing and CRAM-related bugs in htsjdk, bash tab completion support for GATK commands, and many improvements to `Mutect2` and the SV tools. A docker image for this release can be found in the `broadinstitute/gatk` repository on dockerhub.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Highlights of this release include fixes to the GATK4 `HaplotypeCaller` to bring it closer to the output of the GATK3 `HaplotypeCaller` (although many of these fixes still need to be applied to `HaplotypeCallerSpark`), fixes for longstanding indexing and CRAM-related bugs in htsjdk, bash tab completion support for GATK commands, and many improvements to `Mutect2` and the SV tools.

Users should rebuild these models with this release before running `GermlineCNVCaller` in case mode. See the **CNV Tools** section below for more details. **Full list of changes:**; -------------------------. * **New Tools**. * **GnarlyGenotyper** (beta tool) (#4947) (#6075); * The `GnarlyGenotyper` is designed to perform joint genotyping on cohorts of at least tens of thousands of samples called with `HaplotypeCaller` and post-processed with `ReblockGVCF` to produce a multi-sample callset in a super highly scalable manner.; * Caveats:; * `GnarlyGenotyper` is intended to be used with GVCFs for which low quality variants have already been removed, derived from post-processing `HaplotypeCaller` GVCFs with `ReblockGVCF`. See the ""Biggest Practices"" usage example in the `ReblockGVCF` docs for details.; * `GnarlyGenotyper` does not subset alternate alleles and can return some highly multi-allelic sites. PLs will not be output for sites with more than 6 alts to save space.;

Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: eads supporting a variant call. It also introduces a number of experimental improvements to the CNV workflows, as well as a bug fix to `LocusWalkerSpark`. As usual, a docker image for this release can be downloaded from https://hub.docker.com/r/broadinstitute/gatk/. Full list of changes in this release:. * Improve MQ calculation accuracy (#4969); * Change raw MQ to a tuple of (sumSquaredMQs, totalDepth) for better accuracy where there are lots of uninformative reads or called single-sample variants with homRef genotypes. ; * Note that incorporating this change into a pipeline will require a concomitant update to this version for GenomicsDBImport and GenotypeGVCFs. * Updated `SimpleGermlineTagger` and somatic CNV experimental post-processing workflow with several experimental changes that improve precision results, and expand possible evaluations, of GATK CNV (#5252); * New script `combine_tracks.wdl` for post-processing somatic CNV calls. This wdl will perform two operations:; * Increases precision by removing:; * germline segments. As a result, the WDL requires the matched normal segments.; * Areas of common germline activity or error from other cancer studies.; * Converts the tumor model seg file to the same format as AllelicCapSeg, which can be read by ABSOLUTE. This is currently done inline in the WDL. ; * This is not a trivial conversion, since each segment must be called whether it is balanced or not (MAF =? 0.5). The current algorithm relies on hard filtering and may need updating pending evaluation.; * For more information about AllelicCapSeg and ABSOLUTE, see: ; * Carter et al. *Absolute quantification of somatic DNA alterations in human cancer*, Nat Biotechnol. 2012 May; 30(5): 413–421 ; * https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/absolute ; * Brastianos, P.K., Carter S.L., et al. *Genomic Characterization of Brain Metastases Reveals Branched Evolution and Potential Therapeutic Targets* (2015) Cancer Discovery PMID:26410082; * Changes to GATK tools to

All the python tools have been updated appropriately. This will enable easier integration of new machine learning tools. ; * ***If you use python tools outside of the docker, you must rebuild your conda environment for this release***; * `CNNScoreVariants` has been replaced by `NVScoreVariants`, a rewritten and modernized version. The python code for this tool was written by members of NVIDIA Genomics Research. ; * Thank you Babak Zamirai, Ankit Sethia, Mehrzad Samadi, George Vacek and the whole NVIDIA genomics team!; * This [ GATK blog post ](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/10064202674971-Introducing-NVIDIA-s-NVScoreVariants-a-new-deep-learning-tool-for-filtering-variants) has more of the story from when we first made the tool available for testing.; * New `Funcotator` argument `--prefer-mane-transcripts` which improves transcript selection and lays groundwork for upcoming improvements.; * New argument `--variant-output-filtering` which lets you restrict output variants based on the input intervals. This replaces and imrpoves on `--only-output-calls-starting-in-interval` and works with `SelectVariants` and other VariantWalkers. This is useful to prevent duplicating variants when splitting an input VCF into multiple shards. **Full list of changes:**; -------------------------; * **CNNScoreVariants -> NVScoreVariants** (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8004, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/9010, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/9009); * CNNScore variants has been replaced by NVScoreVariants, scripts that use it should be updated to use NVScoreVariants instead.; * The training tools (CNNVariantTrain,
