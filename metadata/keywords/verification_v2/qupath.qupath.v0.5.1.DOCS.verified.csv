Content:  getMenuItem(String) method to main QuPathGUI class; * Improved menu organization, removing several incomplete commands ('Cluster objects (experimental)' & 'OpenCV superpixel test'). -----. ## Version 0.1.0. * Fixed bug in 'Show setup options' that made it difficult to return changed region settings back to the default (but any other change was ok); * Improved consistency of formatting used to display numbers based on other Locales; * Switched default to US Locale; * Removed pre-release notification; * Switched build to request a system rather than user installation (mostly so as to automatically request admin privileges on Windows). -----. ## Version 0.0.7. * New 'Show setup options' dialog to encourage choosing important settings when QuPath is first used.; * 'Fast cell counts' has numerous improvements, including displaying detections closer to the true nucleus center, giving a more informative error message when applied to a non-brightfield image, automatic calculation of a suitable magnification, and including an option to adjust the displayed detection size; * Positive cell densities now calculated dynamically for annotations, or TMA cores containing single annotations with positive cells contained therein.; * Several default parameter values changed for 'Fast cell counts' and 'Simple tissue detection' for better generalization across different image types.; * Added ROI centroids to measurement tables.; * Added sample script to estimate background RGB values for brightfield images; this improves optical density calculations (but without adjusting stain vectors).; * 'Optical density sum' color transform display now incorporates RGB max values (previously these only influenced processing, but not the visualization provided by the Brightness/Contrast command).; * The 'TMA data viewer' now includes p-values in plot legends, for better figure creation.; * The 'TMA data viewer' adds an optional display of 'At risk' patients for survival curves.; * Added new OpenCV a

Content: viewer plane (to easily duplicate objects across z-slices/timepoints); * Make z-index and time-index more visible; * Show in measurement tables and the annotation list; * Make annotation list sorting more predictable; * Uses (in order) time index, z-index, string representation, ROI location, UUID; * Creating a full image annotation with 'selection mode' turned on selects all objects in the current plane; * New command 'Objects > Select... > Select objects on current plane' can achieve the same when not using selection mode; * Panning with synchronized viewers now corrects for different rotations; * Multi-view commands now available through 'View' menu (and not only right-clicking a viewer); * These make it possible to create grid of viewers, to work with multiple images simultaneously; * Annotations can now have visible descriptions; * Visible at the bottom of the 'Annotation' and 'Hierarchy' tabs or in a standalone window; * Support plain text, markdown and html; * Improved scalebar preferences; * New preferences to control font size/weight & line width (bottom left); * Independently adjust font size for location text (bottom right); * Missing thumbnails are automatically regenerated when a project is opened; * Completely rewritten 'View > Show view tracker' command; * Improved channel viewer; * Show only the visible/most relevant channels by default, based on image type; * Right-click to optionally show all available channels; * Middle mouse button switches between 'Move' and last drawing tool (thanks to @zindy - https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1037). #### Styling improvements; * Support custom user styling via CSS (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1063); * Many fixes for the 'Dark modena' theme. #### ImageJ improvements; * Improved support for switching between QuPath objects and ImageJ ROIs; * New 'Extensions > ImageJ > Import ImageJ ROIs' command; * Import `.roi` and `RoiSet.zip` files by drag & drop; * Built-in ImageJ plugin to send RoiManager ROIs

Deployability,"de images from Zeiss; * Images that use libjpeg-turbo; * This includes NDPI files - but most of these can be read with OpenSlide anyway. Apple Silicon users can download the x64 (Intel) version for use with these formats. #### Installed packages include the version & architecture. *QuPath.app* is now renamed to *QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app* (Intel processors) or *QuPath-v0.5.0-aarch64.app* (Apple Silicon). The more awkward naming is in recognition of the fact that users often want to retain multiple versions of QuPath on their computer.; Also, many Apple Silicon users may require installing *both* versions if they need to work with a mixture of supported and unsupported file formats. Previously, versions could replace one another unless they were manually renamed - but that is no longer required. #### Installation notes. Because QuPath is not signed, it is necessary to right-click and choose *Open* to run it for the first time [as described here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/installation.html). Before release, there was also a problem on some Macs where QuPath didn't have permission to access files.; This is hopefully resolved now, but if it occurs then launching QuPath from `Terminal.app` can help, e.g.; ```; /Applications/QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app/Contents/MacOS/QuPath; ```. #### QuPath will require macOS 11 in the future.

Content: ecause they aren't expected to be used as dependencies... although this may change; * Pay attention to any [licensing considerations since QuPath is under the GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#NFUseGPLPlugins). ## QuPath extensions. * Where possible, create extensions rather than modify QuPath's core code; * Extensions are easier to update (usually just a single jar file); * Changes to the core can cause compatibility complications; * It's usually easiest to create a new extension by modifying an existing one; * See https://github.com/qupath for examples (with `qupath-extension` in the repo name); * Pay attention to any [licensing considerations for your extension](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLAndPlugins). ## Coding in QuPath. ### Versioning. * QuPath uses semantic versioning, but hasn't yet reached 1.x.x; * See https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/intro/versions.html; * The API shouldn't change significantly for any 0.x.X release; * API changes are permitted for 0.X.x releases; * But be cautious! Changes frequently break scripts... and thereby annoy users; * It's preferable to break a script completely rather than subtly change its behavior (since no results flag a problem, while wrong results can slip through unnoticed). ### Code style. * The best guide is usually to ensure new code looks much like the existing code; * Use standard Java conventions, e.g. `CamelCase` with a capital letter at the start of a class name and small letter for variable or method; * [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) is used to enforce some style rules; * These are currently fairly minimal... but might increase over time; * The 'correct' [modifier order](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_modifier.html#ModifierOrder) should be used; * Test source files should be named with `Test` at the beginning, e.g. `TestSomeClass.java`; * Aim to make the API stable and maintainable; * Add `public` and `protected` methods and fields with caution - prefe

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: hopefully resolved now, but if it occurs then launching QuPath from `Terminal.app` can help, e.g.; ```; /Applications/QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app/Contents/MacOS/QuPath; ```. #### QuPath will require macOS 11 in the future. After v0.5, QuPath will require macOS 11 or later to run on Mac. This is because of recent changes in JavaFX - for more details, see [here](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/doc-files/release-notes-21.md#javafx-requires-macos-11-or-later) and [here](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8308114). #### Startup may be slower.

(This alternative is allowed only; for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in; object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with; Subsection b above.). The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making; modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all; the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface; definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation; of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code; distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either; source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on); of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component; itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy; from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source; code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though; third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4.

Content: ding regions within a selected annotation; * `RoiTools.createRandomRectangle()` methods created for scripting. #### Core improvements; * All objects can now have IDs; * This aims to make it much easier to match up objects whenever some further analysis is done elsewhere (e.g. classification or clustering in Python or R); * See https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/959; * Much improved scripting support for classifications and measurements (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1094); * Updated method names in `PathObjectHierarchy` for better consistency (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1109); * TMACoreObjects now use 'caseID' rather than 'uniqueID' for clarity (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1114); * Use `URI` in method names consistently, instead of sometimes switching to `Uri` (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1114); * Remove ROI shape from `PathObject.toString()` (and therefore list cells) in favor of showing z/t indexes; * Shape is usually evident from ROI icons & can still be seen in measurement tables; * OpenCV is no longer a dependency of qupath-core (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/961); * Moved `OpenCVTypeAdapters` to qupath-core-processing; * Switched `BufferedImageTools.resize` to use ImageJ internally; * Use `-Djts.overlay=ng` system property by default with Java Topology Suite; * This should resolve many occurrences of the dreaded `TopologyException` when manipulating ROIs & geometries; * Reduced use of Java serialization; * Serialization filters now used to better control deserialized classes; * Improved percentile calculations in `OpenCVTools`; * Output changed to match with NumPy, R and other software; * Performance should be much improved when calculating percentiles from large arrays; * `ImageOps` now supports both per-channel and joint percentile normalization; * [Deep Java Library](https://djl.ai) dependencies added - activated via the [QuPath Deep Java Library extension](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-djl

Content: n that enables other; parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through; a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices""; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible; feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2); tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the; extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the; work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If; the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a; menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work; for making modifications to it. ""Object code"" means any non-source; form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official; standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of; interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that; is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other; than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of; packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major; Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that; Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an; implementation is available to the public in source code form. A; ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component; (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system; (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to; produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all; the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable; work) run the object code and to modify the work,

Tutorials, tweetorials, blog posts and videos can all help add to the community documentation. If you're on Twitter, be sure to [@QuPath](https://twitter.com/qupath). ### Suggesting enhancements. The [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) is also a good place to suggest enhancements to QuPath. Particularly worthy suggestions may be added as [issues](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues) - but please be aware that there is a _long_ backlog of enhancement planned already. The main limiting factor is time. Which leads on to... ### Working together. QuPath is being developed at the University of Edinburgh.; One way to contribute is to [join the group](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=048500). Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has g

Modifiability,"o contribute is to [join the group](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=048500). Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has gone, ask on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). #### Pull requests. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to QuPath itself. Because of the API-is-unstable situation, it would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues). It may be that someone is already working on what you'd like to change, or it might not be compatible with some other work-in-progress.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: o contribute is to [join the group](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=048500). Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/scripting/index.html. However, be warned that the API remains quite unstable. Changing this is a high priority, but do expect breaking changes to continue while major new features are added over the next few releases. > Most API changes are made in the interests of simplification and laying the foundations for major new features (like the pixel classifier). Improving and extending the software is currently a higher priority than backwards compatibility... but hopefully it will reach a stage where both can be achieved.; >; > In the meantime, if you're missing a method and can't track down where it has gone, ask on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). #### Pull requests. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to QuPath itself. Because of the API-is-unstable situation, it would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues). It may be that someone is already working on what you'd like to change, or it might not be compatible with some other work-in-progress. In accordance with [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license), any contributions you _do_ make are under the [same license as QuPath](LICENSE.md).

Please do follow the template to make the job of finding and fixing the bug as painless as possible. ### Supporting others. #### Answering questions; [forum.image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) isn't just a good place for asking questions - it's a good place for answering them too. It's _enormously helpful_ when users of the software answer one another's questions rather than leaving it up to the developer... and it's a good way to learn as well. > The best answer often doesn't depend just on knowing the software, but also understanding the application... so please do consider answering questions, even if you feel your expertise isn't in QuPath. #### Creating documentation; Figured out how to do something, and want to spare others the time it took?. Tutorials, tweetorials, blog posts and videos can all help add to the community documentation. If you're on Twitter, be sure to [@QuPath](https://twitter.com/qupath). ### Suggesting enhancements. The [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath) is also a good place to suggest enhancements to QuPath. Particularly worthy suggestions may be added as [issues](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues) - but please be aware that there is a _long_ backlog of enhancement planned already. The main limiting factor is time. Which leads on to... ### Working together. QuPath is being developed at the University of Edinburgh.; One way to contribute is to [join the group](https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=048500). Another is to collaborate on research projects that result in developing new methods that can be integrated back into QuPath for everyone to use. Contact Pete [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead) if you wish to talk academic things. ### Writing code. #### Scripts & extensions. The easiest way to extend QuPath is to write a script or an extension. There's some documentation at https:",enhance,MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CONTRIBUTING.md:2989,enhancements,2989,CONTRIBUTING.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/CONTRIBUTING.md,1,['enhance'],['enhancements'],"The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments.

Content: per mm^2 measurement fixed; this could be wrong in v0.2.0-m5 (other versions not affected); ### Important behavior change!; * Parent-child relationships are no longer automatically calculated between objects!; For an explanation of the reasons behind this change & what it means, see the blog.; ### Other changes:; * Pixel classifier shows live area measurements with 'Classification' output (in m5 this worked only with 'Probability' output); * New 'Detection centroid distances 2D' command (e.g. to find distances to cells with different classifications); * Smoother drawing, faster viewer repainting; * Point annotation improvements; * Faster repainting; * Converting detections to points now uses nucleus ROIs when applied to cells, no longer requires deleting the detections; * More shortcuts, e.g. Ctrl+Alt+A to select annotations, Ctrl+Alt+D to select detections; * GeometryROI now replaces AreaROI and AWTAreaROI for improved performance and consistency; * Fixed bug when converting ROIs with nested holes to JTS Geometries; * Undo/Redo and tile cache size information added to Memory Monitor; * Added support for ImageWriters to write to output streams; * Updated build script to Gradle 6.0; * Use bioformats_package.jar rather than separate dependences (easier to upgrade/downgrade if needed). -----. ## Version 0.2.0-m5; This is a *milestone* (i.e. still in development) version made available to try out new features early.; Changes include:; * Many improvements to the pixel classifier; * New 'structure tensor' features; * Currently-training classifier can still operate when images are changed; * Added live feature overlays to view classifier features in context; * Added 'Advanced' features, including optional PCA and selecting a 'Boundary' classification; * Ability to save & reload classifiers (format may change!); * New 'Create threshold classifier' command (replaces old simple threshold command); * Improved 'Dark' theme (available in the preferences); * Scripting Improvements

Content:  the default (but any other change was ok); * Improved consistency of formatting used to display numbers based on other Locales; * Switched default to US Locale; * Removed pre-release notification; * Switched build to request a system rather than user installation (mostly so as to automatically request admin privileges on Windows). -----. ## Version 0.0.7. * New 'Show setup options' dialog to encourage choosing important settings when QuPath is first used.; * 'Fast cell counts' has numerous improvements, including displaying detections closer to the true nucleus center, giving a more informative error message when applied to a non-brightfield image, automatic calculation of a suitable magnification, and including an option to adjust the displayed detection size; * Positive cell densities now calculated dynamically for annotations, or TMA cores containing single annotations with positive cells contained therein.; * Several default parameter values changed for 'Fast cell counts' and 'Simple tissue detection' for better generalization across different image types.; * Added ROI centroids to measurement tables.; * Added sample script to estimate background RGB values for brightfield images; this improves optical density calculations (but without adjusting stain vectors).; * 'Optical density sum' color transform display now incorporates RGB max values (previously these only influenced processing, but not the visualization provided by the Brightness/Contrast command).; * The 'TMA data viewer' now includes p-values in plot legends, for better figure creation.; * The 'TMA data viewer' adds an optional display of 'At risk' patients for survival curves.; * Added new OpenCV and OpenSlide binaries to address portability issues on Linux.; * Added new OpenSlide binaries for macOS to fix bug that prevented some *.mrxs files opening (if bmps were involved).; * Fixed bug that caused scripts that logged a lot of text to cause the user interface to become sluggish or freeze.; * Fixed bu

Safety,"es should be named with `Test` at the beginning, e.g. `TestSomeClass.java`; * Aim to make the API stable and maintainable; * Add `public` and `protected` methods and fields with caution - prefer `private` where possible; * Always use `@override` when overriding a method; * Use full import lists at the top of each class, not starred imports for all classes in a package. ### Javadoc. * Docs are currently at https://qupath.github.io/javadoc/docs/; * This currently includes all QuPath jars together for ease of search & cross-referencing; * When QuPath is properly modularized, the docs should be reorganized by module; * All `public` and `protected` classes, methods and fields should have doc comments and list all parameters; * It isn't essential to explain what `return` returns unless it's very surprising; * Use annotations as appropriate; * `@since` annotations should be added for new methods (although it's easy to forget...); * `@deprecated` annotations should be added for regrettable old methods for at least one release before the methods are removed. ### Saving & loading. * When something needs to be persistent, try to avoid Java serialization; * Serialization is currently used for `.qpdata` files, but ultimately this should be removed; * Prefer JSON to other kinds of serialization; * Thinking *'could I read this in Python if I wanted to?'* can be a good guide when choosing a format; * Use `qupath.lib.io.GsonTools` to help; * Keep forwards and backwards compatibility in mind... serialization is hard; * Use UTF-8 encoding consistently with text files; * This should be the default from Java 18 - but best specify just in case. ### Scripting. * QuPath's default scripting language is Groovy; * When adding new processing commands, these should be scriptable as far as possible; * This means adding a command [to the workflow](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/scripting/workflows.html); * Ensuring scriptability is one of the least fun bits of adding anything new...",avoid,MatchSource.DOCS,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md:10466,avoid,10466,TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/tree/v0.5.1/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md,1,['avoid'],['avoid'],"The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage.

Content: es should be named with `Test` at the beginning, e.g. `TestSomeClass.java`; * Aim to make the API stable and maintainable; * Add `public` and `protected` methods and fields with caution - prefer `private` where possible; * Always use `@override` when overriding a method; * Use full import lists at the top of each class, not starred imports for all classes in a package. ### Javadoc. * Docs are currently at https://qupath.github.io/javadoc/docs/; * This currently includes all QuPath jars together for ease of search & cross-referencing; * When QuPath is properly modularized, the docs should be reorganized by module; * All `public` and `protected` classes, methods and fields should have doc comments and list all parameters; * It isn't essential to explain what `return` returns unless it's very surprising; * Use annotations as appropriate; * `@since` annotations should be added for new methods (although it's easy to forget...); * `@deprecated` annotations should be added for regrettable old methods for at least one release before the methods are removed. ### Saving & loading. * When something needs to be persistent, try to avoid Java serialization; * Serialization is currently used for `.qpdata` files, but ultimately this should be removed; * Prefer JSON to other kinds of serialization; * Thinking *'could I read this in Python if I wanted to?'* can be a good guide when choosing a format; * Use `qupath.lib.io.GsonTools` to help; * Keep forwards and backwards compatibility in mind... serialization is hard; * Use UTF-8 encoding consistently with text files; * This should be the default from Java 18 - but best specify just in case. ### Scripting. * QuPath's default scripting language is Groovy; * When adding new processing commands, these should be scriptable as far as possible; * This means adding a command [to the workflow](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/scripting/workflows.html); * Ensuring scriptability is one of the least fun bits of adding anything new...

Content: modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether; gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that; you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the; source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their; rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and; (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,; distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain; that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free; software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we; want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so; that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original; authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software; patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free; program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the; program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any; patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and; modification follow. 		 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION. 0.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering; access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent; access to copy the source code from the same place counts as; distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not; compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4.

Content: er the Contribution of such Contributor, if; any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall; apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the; time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the; Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed; Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations; which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed; hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the; licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are; provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the; patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each; Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by; any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights; or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses; granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to; secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For; example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient; to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire; that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient; copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright; license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form; under its own license agreement, provided that:. a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and. b) its license agreement:. i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties; and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions; of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of; merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;. ii) effectively excludes
