One of these resources is the output.

Therefore, within Psi4 we have created the `psi::PsiOutStream` class, of which `psi::outfile` is an instance.

We then examined how psi4 determines and processes the host name. It turns out, psi4 uses the `gethostname` function from the C API to get up to the first 40 bytes of the host name, and then it writes those bytes to `timer.dat`. The host name of this particular compute cluster is over 40 chars/bytes. This is unsafe because if a host name has more than 40 characters, the null byte (`\0`) won't be written to `timer.dat` to signify the end of the string, and psi4 will continue to write whatever is in memory past the 40 chars/bytes until it hits a null byte. This also explains the original error, b/c writing random bytes to a file can lead to non-utf-8-compliant files. It turns out that [linux defines a maximum host name length of 64](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gethostname.2.html), so the easy fix here is to just increase the size of the host name buffer from 40 to 65 (== 64 + 1 for the null byte at the end).

Testability,"# Overview. This is version 2.0.0 of the Psi4 build system. It is designed to speed-up build times as well as aid in transitioning to a more modular model driven by QCDB or incorporated into the Pulsar framework.; ## Disclaimer. This is _NOT_ quite ready to merge yet, but represents a substantial change that I wanted developers to start looking at and provide feedback on. In particular:; - [x] Get remote builds via Travis-CI working; - [x] @lothian 's coupled cluster code tests are failing (really could use help there); - [x] Fix sow/reap tests (not using installed data dir?); - [x] Failing test cases:; - [x] cbs-xtpl-freq; - [x] fnocc2; - [x] tu4-h2o-freq ; - [x] Hook back-up: ; - [x] chemps2; - [x] erd; - [x] dkh; - [x] gdma; - [x] ambit; - [x] pcmsolver; - [ ] Get binary working (need help from @loriab); - [x] Test (and then most likely fix) plugin system; - [x] Move GTFock to external; - [x] Libint is now external, closes #355 ; ## Speed. By means of comparison, on my box the old build system took 34 minutes and this build took 14 minutes. Both build times are for a debug build, ignore the time to build Boost, use the default angular momentum, and are run on 6 cores. Furthermore, this new build does a dramatically better job of tracking dependencies among files. For example libint/libderiv should only build once and editing a single file in mints no longer triggers a full recompilation (of course touching a file like Molecule.h basically will). This means subsequent builds should be dramatically faster, in my experience so far typically only the file that was changed needs recompiled.; ## Modularity. Under the old build the entire Psi4 build project had to track dependencies for all plugins and external interfaces. This was quickly becoming a nightmare as evidenced by the 3,000,000 emails we have been getting about chemps2 breaking. I have transitioned us to what is known in CMake land as a superbuild.

In particular:; - [x] Get remote builds via Travis-CI working; - [x] @lothian 's coupled cluster code tests are failing (really could use help there); - [x] Fix sow/reap tests (not using installed data dir?); - [x] Failing test cases:; - [x] cbs-xtpl-freq; - [x] fnocc2; - [x] tu4-h2o-freq ; - [x] Hook back-up: ; - [x] chemps2; - [x] erd; - [x] dkh; - [x] gdma; - [x] ambit; - [x] pcmsolver; - [ ] Get binary working (need help from @loriab); - [x] Test (and then most likely fix) plugin system; - [x] Move GTFock to external; - [x] Libint is now external, closes #355 ; ## Speed. By means of comparison, on my box the old build system took 34 minutes and this build took 14 minutes. Both build times are for a debug build, ignore the time to build Boost, use the default angular momentum, and are run on 6 cores. Furthermore, this new build does a dramatically better job of tracking dependencies among files. For example libint/libderiv should only build once and editing a single file in mints no longer triggers a full recompilation (of course touching a file like Molecule.h basically will). This means subsequent builds should be dramatically faster, in my experience so far typically only the file that was changed needs recompiled.; ## Modularity. Under the old build the entire Psi4 build project had to track dependencies for all plugins and external interfaces. This was quickly becoming a nightmare as evidenced by the 3,000,000 emails we have been getting about chemps2 breaking. I have transitioned us to what is known in CMake land as a superbuild. In such a build all pieces of a package, including the depend

Testability,"## Description. Fixed incorrect B matrix for 'interfragment coordinates'. These coordinates are not used by default, but the user can specify them to create very specific coordinates. They may be useful, e.g., in combination with 'freeze_intrafrag' for fixed-body optimizations. When symmetry is turned on, there is a difficulty with the symmetry detection in combination with the way in which the displacements are carried out for these coordinates. A loosening of the symmetry tolerance when computing the symmetrized geometry usually works and has been implemented. In the future, it may be best to carry out the displacements in these coordinates iteratively and numerically as they are for redundant intrafrag coordinates.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: ## Description. Fixed incorrect B matrix for 'interfragment coordinates'. These coordinates are not used by default, but the user can specify them to create very specific coordinates. They may be useful, e.g., in combination with 'freeze_intrafrag' for fixed-body optimizations. When symmetry is turned on, there is a difficulty with the symmetry detection in combination with the way in which the displacements are carried out for these coordinates. A loosening of the symmetry tolerance when computing the symmetrized geometry usually works and has been implemented. In the future, it may be best to carry out the displacements in these coordinates iteratively and numerically as they are for redundant intrafrag coordinates. However, this approach would be more hazardous with no upside in C1, and I don't have time to implement it right now anyway.; - [ ] Feature1; Reference atoms can now be specified by the user with a standard multi-dimensional python list.

While their URL change may be a bit ironic, it's now [encrypted](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=doi.org) and the old `dx` subdomain is being redirected. So, there is no urgency here. However, for consistency, this PRs suggests to update all static DOI links accordingly, plus the code that generates new DOI links. ## Checklist; - [-] Tests added for any new features; - [-] [All or relevant fraction of full tests run](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html#how-to-run-a-subset-of-tests). ## Status; - [x] Ready for review; - [ ] Ready for merge

That PR hasn't been kept up-to-date with the many changes to JK since, so I decided to reimplement it from scratch. The motivation and ideas are the same, however, so I will copy-paste the description here:. This PR is the second in a series of planned PRs designed to remove density screening from the TwoBodyAOInt object and into the JK object, with PR https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2547 being the first such PR. Having density screening available in TwoBodyAOInt runs the risk of applying density screening to algorithms where density screening doesn't make sense. Thus, it would be a good idea to move the logic of density screening to where it is more correctly applied, i.e., the JK object. The primary purposes of this PR are twofold:. First, this PR introduce the shell_significant() framework to the JK class. The shell_significant() framework starts with a shell_significant() virtual function that exists in the base JK class. The shell_significant() function can then be redefined specifically for different JK derived classes as needed. The existence of shell_significant() provides a unified framework for performing screening for any JK method, and it also provides the method by which density screening can be added directly to the relevant JK classes.; Second, this PR uses the shell_significant() framework to reimplement screening for certain JK methods. Most significantly, as implied in the first point, the biggest change in this regard was the removal of shell_significant_density() from TwoBodyAOInt into the domain and its reimplementation into the JK shell_significant() definitions.

The first PR (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2848) applied to MemDFJK, and the second PR (this one) applies to DiskDFJK. The goal of this PR project is to add an expert keyword to allow user control over which subalgorithm is used by either MemDFJK or DiskDFJK. See, MemDFJK and DiskDFJK, despite their name, each have separate ""subalgorithms"" optimized to be run either in-core or out-of-core. While MemDFJK and DiskDFJK can be independently selected with `SCF_TYPE`, their subalgorithms cannot be; subalgorithm selection was previously controlled exclusively through memory allocated to Psi4. The mini-project this PR is part of, is meant to rectify that issue. In the previous PR of this project, the `SCF_SUBTYPE` keyword was introduced, an expert option allowing for forced execution of a given subalgorithm. The default option, `AUTO`, has the code select the subalgorithm automatically, as before. `INCORE` forces MemDFJK to use the in-core subalgorithm, and throws an exception if not enough memory is allocated to Psi4 to do so. `OUT_OF_CORE` forces MemDFJK to use the out-of-core subalgorithm, even if enough memory is allocated to Psi4 to use the in-core subalgorithm.
