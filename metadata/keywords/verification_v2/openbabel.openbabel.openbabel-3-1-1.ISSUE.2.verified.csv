They should be real values by definition (double). In this case as the distance (or similarity measure) for 2 conformers is defined as the number of different values in the rotors vectors (key_distance method), it's always an integer value, that's probably why I started to define them as int and forgot to later turn them to double. As a matter of fact one could define another distance (I used this key comparison since it's fast), that could return non integer values, so that's important to define these radii as double.; > ; > Here is the diff I propose to update to confomersearch.cpp: basically properly initialize with default double values, and cast int values returned from key_distance to double in order to make the comparison with the sharing radii (and keep the compiler happy).

Content: I contacted Benoit and he sent along a fix:. > Yes, you're right there is a type inconsitency for these sharing radii, sorry for that. They should be real values by definition (double). In this case as the distance (or similarity measure) for 2 conformers is defined as the number of different values in the rotors vectors (key_distance method), it's always an integer value, that's probably why I started to define them as int and forgot to later turn them to double. As a matter of fact one could define another distance (I used this key comparison since it's fast), that could return non integer values, so that's important to define these radii as double.; > ; > Here is the diff I propose to update to confomersearch.cpp: basically properly initialize with default double values, and cast int values returned from key_distance to double in order to make the comparison with the sharing radii (and keep the compiler happy). With that I believe there should not be implicit casts left behind. [conformersearch.txt](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/files/1719803/conformersearch.txt)
