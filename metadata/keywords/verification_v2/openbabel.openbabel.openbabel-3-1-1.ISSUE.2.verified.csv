They should be real values by definition (double). In this case as the distance (or similarity measure) for 2 conformers is defined as the number of different values in the rotors vectors (key_distance method), it's always an integer value, that's probably why I started to define them as int and forgot to later turn them to double. As a matter of fact one could define another distance (I used this key comparison since it's fast), that could return non integer values, so that's important to define these radii as double.; > ; > Here is the diff I propose to update to confomersearch.cpp: basically properly initialize with default double values, and cast int values returned from key_distance to double in order to make the comparison with the sharing radii (and keep the compiler happy).

Content: I contacted Benoit and he sent along a fix:. > Yes, you're right there is a type inconsitency for these sharing radii, sorry for that. They should be real values by definition (double). In this case as the distance (or similarity measure) for 2 conformers is defined as the number of different values in the rotors vectors (key_distance method), it's always an integer value, that's probably why I started to define them as int and forgot to later turn them to double. As a matter of fact one could define another distance (I used this key comparison since it's fast), that could return non integer values, so that's important to define these radii as double.; > ; > Here is the diff I propose to update to confomersearch.cpp: basically properly initialize with default double values, and cast int values returned from key_distance to double in order to make the comparison with the sharing radii (and keep the compiler happy). With that I believe there should not be implicit casts left behind. [conformersearch.txt](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/files/1719803/conformersearch.txt)

This is because of the new function in InChI for producing a key. While possible to support both versions though #ifdef checks, it's okay, I think, to have this compilation problem. Few use InChI and fewer use the older code. I wanted to disable InChI support for my build. The configure script says. --disable-inchi do not build the InChI library. I tracked the problem down to this line:. if test x""$LIBINCHI"" = ""x"" -o ""$inchi"" = ""yes""; then. It should be. if test x""$LIBINCHI"" = ""x"" -o ""$inchi"" = ""no""; then. That is, ""if the inchi code could not be found or the inchi option is *disabled*"". . Reported by: dalke

Content: I have the same issue. It's impossible to use `openbabel` with python virtual env. I really need the openbabel python binding in a poetry env. This is a simple way to reproduce the issue:. ```bash; docker run -i -t -v ""${PWD}"":/wdir -w /wdir ubuntu:latest bash. apt-get update; apt-get install -y python3-pip; pip3 install poetry; poetry add openbabel; ```. The error is the similar to the one described in the opening of this issue:; ```; ...; Warning: invalid version number '3.1.1.1'.; Guessing Open Babel location:; - include_dirs: ['/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/acpype-_njGwaMt-py3.8/include', '/usr/include/python3.8', '/usr/local/include/openbabel3']; - library_dirs: ['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib']; building 'openbabel._openbabel' extension; swigging openbabel/openbabel-python.i to openbabel/openbabel-python_wrap.cpp; swig -python -c++ -small -O -templatereduce -naturalvar -I/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/acpype-_njGwaMt-py3.8/include -I/usr/include/python3.8 -I/usr/local/include/openbabel3 -o openbabel/openbabel-python_wrap.cpp openbabel/openbabel-python.i.

I'm ok with both options, although I think it might be best if I removed the coordgen part for the time being, and the maeparser one was merged, even if just to update it to a more recent version. Maybe @lorton has a preference about this?

Only the conversion about `PEMETREXED_1.sdb` yielded a reasonable display of the `.pdb` with different atom colors for C, H, N, O. You know that Open Babel may read and write `.sdf` and `.pdb` files. I knew there are multiple ways an `.xyz` or a `.pdb` file may be written and occasionally -- just for the sake of consistency -- I use Open Babel to «correct» these prior to further processing. Thanks to your test files, I learn that this apparently equally is the case for `.sdf` files and I thus issued conversions in pattern of `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1.sdf -osdf -O NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf` for both `NATEGLINIDE` and `PEMETREXED`, and then converted these by e.g., `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf -opdb NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.pdb`.

Deployability,"I've been reading up on charge equilibration methods, specifically the EQeq method by Wilmer et al. (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz3008485) and looking over the code in the supporting info (which was released in an addition to the original paper, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz301439a). . I've noticed some inconsistencies with the implementation in both codes with the derivation provided in the supporting info. I'll focus on the Ewald implementation, as that's the one that I've been spending time on:. # Solving the Problem; The basis of the EQeq method is forming a system of equations and solving it with Householder or something equivalent.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: I've been reading up on charge equilibration methods, specifically the EQeq method by Wilmer et al. (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz3008485) and looking over the code in the supporting info (which was released in an addition to the original paper, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz301439a). . I've noticed some inconsistencies with the implementation in both codes with the derivation provided in the supporting info. I'll focus on the Ewald implementation, as that's the one that I've been spending time on:. # Solving the Problem; The basis of the EQeq method is forming a system of equations and solving it with Householder or something equivalent. This system of equations aims to minimize all charges in the system, subject to the constraint that the system is charge neutral. I won't go into details of the method here, but it uses Lagrange multipliers and eventually solves a problem similar to `Ax = b` where `x` contains the charges in the system. . The main difficulty of this method is constructing `A`, but each entry contains a few terms, including Coulombic terms, idempotential and orbital overlap energy. # Orbital Overlap Energy; In the derivation Wilmer et al. talk about the orbital overlap energy term (or short-ranged damping term), which they define as. <a href=""https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" title=""E_o(r_{ij}) = \sum_m \left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K} \right )^2

Yet in either case, I have tried splitting my_big.sdf into 400 smaller files with --splitinto 400 and -m 400, but without success. Is the ability to split large sdf files into additional files depreciated? . <!--; Before submitting please search open and closed issues at; https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel.

The older the Mercury, the less of libraries are installed (regardless if eventually be useable by a license, or not) and less resource hungry because they started to pack it with PovRay for image rendering, a minimal Python + some larger Python libraries for visualization one would use when accessing the CSD database via the Python API. The registration into the CCDC site does not cost you money, only offers you some notifications about continuous update of the database and webinars you may join for free; all at a moderate to low frequency of e-mails (1-4 emails per month). But it could be worth to address the question about building these slabs programmatically, without Mercury, on [https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/), too.

Deployability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.).

Content: Logged In: YES ; user_id=1189615. Thanks very much for these comments. User interface design ; depends on fitting in with the user's expectations. The ; more examples of these, the better. . The GUI has a number of design faults and bugs which I ; have put off correcting because I would prefer to put the ; effort into a cross-platform GUI. (I would welcome ; suggestions what to use to build such an interface). To respond to your comments:. (0) The installation is deliberately minimal. I would have ; thought that whatever you use for unzipping, you can ; always specify the destination folder. The current most ; common approach would be double clicking the zip file in ; Windows XP, which would do as you suggest. . (1)(2)(7) The design without a menu bar is perhaps less ; common than it used to be and maybe is too disconcerting. ; I agree there should be some About info. The control menu ; is a possible place for this, but maybe nobody would think ; to look there. I agree there should be a minimize button. (3) and (4) are bugs. The failure of All Chemical Formats ; seems to be to a 256 character limit on the filter string ; and has only come to light when all the formats were ; included. Why this should occur needs tracking down. (5) illustrates a UI dilemma. Should ; a)the type of file requested, or ; b)the extension of the file selected by the user ; have priority on what format OB attempts to convert. I ; chose b), and I provided a Force this Format checkbox to ; cover the case where this was not what was required. You ; prefer a), giving priority to the user's earlier choice ; via the Format dropdown and an opportunity to Force file ; Extension via a checkbox. Both are reasonable, but I ; prefer a) on the principle that it uses a later deliberate ; user choice. (6) I agree that more feedback is needed to help the user ; to know whether local or file input is being used. Making ; it read-only when the file option is selected and ; automatically updating the contents

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1444119; Originator: NO. This is a bug in the canonicalizer. The canonicalizer figures out the symmetry groups of the atoms without taking chirality into account, so any time there are two atoms that are identical except for their chirality, you'll get two possible ""canonical"" SMILES. Another instance of this is documented in the code, where a cis/trans configuration is incorrectly analyzed because, without taking chirality into account, it appears to be symmetrical and hence not cis or trans. In this case there is an axis of symmetry through a ring, and the only difference in the two halves of the ring are the two chiral centers themselves. So when the canonical-SMILES tree-generator reaches the ring, it has a choice between going left or right, and both paths appear identical, so it can generate two different canonical SMILES. The canonicalizer needs to add chirality to the atom-invarients *before* it starts analyzing chirality. However, even this is tricky, because sometimes a center can be chiral or achiral depending on the chirality of *other* atoms, leading to a sort of chicken-or-egg problem. Maybe a two-pass symmetry analysis is needed: First without chirality, then add in the chirality as new atom-invarients when a tie between two chiral atoms is discovered, and re-do the symmetry analysis.

Content: Logged In: YES ; user_id=1444119; Originator: NO. This is a bug in the canonicalizer. The canonicalizer figures out the symmetry groups of the atoms without taking chirality into account, so any time there are two atoms that are identical except for their chirality, you'll get two possible ""canonical"" SMILES. Another instance of this is documented in the code, where a cis/trans configuration is incorrectly analyzed because, without taking chirality into account, it appears to be symmetrical and hence not cis or trans. In this case there is an axis of symmetry through a ring, and the only difference in the two halves of the ring are the two chiral centers themselves. So when the canonical-SMILES tree-generator reaches the ring, it has a choice between going left or right, and both paths appear identical, so it can generate two different canonical SMILES. The canonicalizer needs to add chirality to the atom-invarients *before* it starts analyzing chirality. However, even this is tricky, because sometimes a center can be chiral or achiral depending on the chirality of *other* atoms, leading to a sort of chicken-or-egg problem. Maybe a two-pass symmetry analysis is needed: First without chirality, then add in the chirality as new atom-invarients when a tie between two chiral atoms is discovered, and re-do the symmetry analysis.

I see three possible (and independent) approaches:; 1) An explicit HEM ""residue"" in the PDB handling that adds bond orders ; correctly, much like other residues.; 2) Explicit typing rules in bondtyp.txt.; 3) Addition of a ring bond-order assignment step to the bondtyper.cpp ; code, independent of the functional group assignment. This can take ; aromaticity into account and propagate around a macrocycle ring. More examples of ligands would definitely help this effort. -Geoff. Original comment by: @ghutchis

I think the developers' choice for a web browser like Firefox was that these programs capable to display the .svg as an image rather than a text typically already are installed. Running Linux Debian 11 bullseye (branch testing) comprising both OpenBabel (version 3.1.0) as well as the graphical editor [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (version 1.0.2) I use successfully the «display only» program of the later, `inkview` to inspect a single .svg by. `inkview example.svg &`. or to browse through a collection of .svg in a folder by. `inkview *.svg &`. As mentioned earlier [here](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inbox/-/issues/3712#note_422339579), this works well for .svg generated by RDKit, but equally for .svg by OpenBabel. (For comparison, I attach reference data by both below.) Thus, if running `obgui` in Linux, I would welcome if it were possible to set a pointer like `/usr/bin/inkview %s` when instructing OpenBabel about which viewer to use. There are other programs to display .svg visually, too. Examples include [irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com/) if extended by the optional plugin; or [Xnview](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/), and `display` of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php).

Deployability,"Some OBChemTsfm transformations, especially on radicals, can result in unexpected implicit hydrogen counts since PR#1576. I wrote up an example failure in the first commit of this PR, where assigning a charge of -1 to an atom can give it 255 implicit hydrogens under certain conditions. I suspect the underlying cause is unsigned integer arithmetic in phmodel.cpp:321 (possibly also 343). Subtraction of two unsigned ints gives an unsigned int--if the difference would be negative, then the result is wrapped back to `UINT_MAX`, e.g. printing `(j->second - old_bond_order)` gives 4294967295 instead of -1. Then there's some truncation to fit in the unsigned char. But even if the overall expression gives the right answer most of the time, I think it would be clearer to be more explicit about the math, which would fix special cases like this bug. How should we adjust the line(s) of code in phmodel.cpp? We could explicitly typecast everything to a signed int then ensure that there are at least zero implicit hydrogens, but that seems verbose. @baoilleach Please feel free to directly commit on my PR if you have any ideas.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Some OBChemTsfm transformations, especially on radicals, can result in unexpected implicit hydrogen counts since PR#1576. I wrote up an example failure in the first commit of this PR, where assigning a charge of -1 to an atom can give it 255 implicit hydrogens under certain conditions. I suspect the underlying cause is unsigned integer arithmetic in phmodel.cpp:321 (possibly also 343). Subtraction of two unsigned ints gives an unsigned int--if the difference would be negative, then the result is wrapped back to `UINT_MAX`, e.g. printing `(j->second - old_bond_order)` gives 4294967295 instead of -1. Then there's some truncation to fit in the unsigned char. But even if the overall expression gives the right answer most of the time, I think it would be clearer to be more explicit about the math, which would fix special cases like this bug. How should we adjust the line(s) of code in phmodel.cpp? We could explicitly typecast everything to a signed int then ensure that there are at least zero implicit hydrogens, but that seems verbose. @baoilleach Please feel free to directly commit on my PR if you have any ideas. Of course we'll need to update the test case with the correct answer as well (not H255).

Supplying the path for EIGEN3 should be enough, but if things work with pkg-config, I'll be better able to find the problem. Thanks!. Original comment by: @ghutchis

Deployability,"Sorry for the slow reply. It's not too much trouble to put a new 3.0 package onto PyPI. @e-kwsm has already done most of the hard work in updating the `setup.py` script in #2060. Someone just needs to run `python setup.py sdist` in the `scripts/python` directory, then upload the result with `twine`. However... there is a bug in the 3.0 release that means that the pip install process will fail to find the OB include directory. This has since been fixed (#2059, @e-kwsm again, thanks!) but I would recommend against uploading the sdist until this fix is released (in 3.0.1?), otherwise it will just break `pip install...` for everyone who hasn't compiled the latest master from source. Honestly, this is just the latest example of how unreliable it is to install via pip with a sdist that relies on pkgconfig to find OB and then run swig at install time.

Say, for using the following command, see the output obtained by me:; ; ```; $ pip install -e .; Looking in indexes: https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple; Obtaining file:///home/werner/Public/hpc/tools/openbabel.git/scripts/python; Installing collected packages: openbabel; Attempting uninstall: openbabel; Found existing installation: openbabel 3.0.0; Uninstalling openbabel-3.0.0:; Successfully uninstalled openbabel-3.0.0; Running setup.py develop for openbabel; Successfully installed openbabel; ```. PS. I love anaconda/miniconda also, but still want to do the job by cpython. The conda-based workflow seems have the following shortcommings:. - Ofter too slow for running the SAT solver to find the requirements' packages list for the environment.; - Maybe problematic for mixing the usage of pip and conda to install packages, say for this problem:; https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9752; - All of the packages are per-compiled.

Deployability,Thanks for commenting @baoilleach :). As long as the functions are exposed (or there is another clever way to easily calculate what I need) then I see no problem with where things are stored in the C++ API. I used to use the `GetImplicitValence()` method on atoms in combination with `GetValence()` to figure out whether or not an atom needed to be given a hydrogen. Such a situation can arise if one needed to cut (in openbabel technically remove) a bond between a QM region and MM region with FragIt. I found an old blogpost of mine on the subject from almost 6 years ago (http://pythonchem.blogspot.dk/2012/01/adding-hydrogen-atoms-is-no-mean-feat.html) which explains it with a slightly different angle. The code I used has barely changed. The updated code (see https://github.com/FragIt/fragit-main/blob/develop/src/qmmm.py#L139) needs to know how many bonds really would like to be present and the following code apparently satisfies my testcases.

Deployability,"There are two separate problems here:. 1) The external build scripts for the Perl and Python bindings assume that libopenbabel will be in lib/, and they can't handle it if the library is instead in lib64/. CMake will put it in lib64/ if you tell it -DLIB_SUFFIX=64, which is the appropriate thing to do on a multilib system. . 2) The CMake build instructions for the Ruby bindings pass ""--with-openbabel-lib=${BABEL_LIBRARY}"" whereas what is wanted is ""--with-openbabel-lib=${CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}"". That is, the library name is passed instead of the library directory. The latter is particularly insidious. If there is a pre-existing libopenbabel in the linker's library search path then the ${BABEL_LIBRARY} version will find and link against that, thus (a) masking the error, and (b) possibly recording the wrong soname as a dependency of the Ruby bindings.

CMake will put it in lib64/ if you tell it -DLIB_SUFFIX=64, which is the appropriate thing to do on a multilib system. . 2) The CMake build instructions for the Ruby bindings pass ""--with-openbabel-lib=${BABEL_LIBRARY}"" whereas what is wanted is ""--with-openbabel-lib=${CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}"". That is, the library name is passed instead of the library directory. The latter is particularly insidious. If there is a pre-existing libopenbabel in the linker's library search path then the ${BABEL_LIBRARY} version will find and link against that, thus (a) masking the error, and (b) possibly recording the wrong soname as a dependency of the Ruby bindings. I can provide patches for both of these, but I don't seem to be able to attach files, and they would be mangled if I included them in-line. E-mail me if you want them.
