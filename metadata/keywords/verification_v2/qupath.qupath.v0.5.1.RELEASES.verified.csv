Content: many small-but-important fixes and updates requested over the past month. Most noticeably, it is now possible to export annotation and detection measurements more easily from within scripts. Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**. This has been written in a particularly general way, so that it can be applied to up to 2 chromogenic stains (brightfield) or any number of fluorescence stains that QuPath can handle. Further testing is required and the command still subject to change... therefore feedback would be welcome if you find it useful. <img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4690904/21578954/3104ec02-cf8d-11e6-9938-c2d0b29bb5b0.jpg"" width=320px />.

You can now drag & drop multiple images to add them to a project - and set the _Image type_ during import (to avoid being pestered by popup dialogs later); * The code has changed _a lot_ with the goal of simplifying it & making new features possible. Hopefully this fixes some bugs... although be aware it may also have added some new ones.; * The software is changing faster than the documentation. If you want further information:; * For questions and discussions, use https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath; * Follow [@QuPath on Twitter](https://twitter.com/qupath); * Check out [Towards v0.2.0](https://qupath.github.io/QuPath-v0.2.0) for an overview; * Read the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details; * See the [Commit log](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/commits/master) for most detail of all

Most noticeably, it is now possible to export annotation and detection measurements more easily from within scripts. Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**. This has been written in a particularly general way, so that it can be applied to up to 2 chromogenic stains (brightfield) or any number of fluorescence stains that QuPath can handle. Further testing is required and the command still subject to change... therefore feedback would be welcome if you find it useful. <img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4690904/21578954/3104ec02-cf8d-11e6-9938-c2d0b29bb5b0.jpg"" width=320px />.
