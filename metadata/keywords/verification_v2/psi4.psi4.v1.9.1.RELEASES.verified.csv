All Psi4 calls will continue to do only 2-body -D3 as default (regardless of dftd3 or s-dftd3 engine). That is, -d3 is still an alias to -d3zero which is now an alias to a new extension -d3zero2b, which can now be given explicitly disallow 3-body as a tweakable parameter (internally, s9:=0.0). When s-dftd3 is the engine, another set of new extensions, e.g., -d3atm alias of -d3zeroatm turns on 3-body (s9=1.0) and allows user tweaks. This latter is the same behavior as -D4, which turns on 3-body by default.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: d slightly between dftd3 and s-dftd3. In particular, the former can also do -D2 and the latter can do 3-body -D3 in the same call as 2-body -D3. All Psi4 calls will continue to do only 2-body -D3 as default (regardless of dftd3 or s-dftd3 engine). That is, -d3 is still an alias to -d3zero which is now an alias to a new extension -d3zero2b, which can now be given explicitly disallow 3-body as a tweakable parameter (internally, s9:=0.0). When s-dftd3 is the engine, another set of new extensions, e.g., -d3atm alias of -d3zeroatm turns on 3-body (s9=1.0) and allows user tweaks. This latter is the same behavior as -D4, which turns on 3-body by default. If this seems confusing, state what calc you want — e.g., energy(""b3lyp-d3atm"") — and Psi4 will figure out if you have the right engine to do the job. (#2791); * psi4.core.Molecule.run_dftd3 and qcdb.Molecule.run_dftd3 don't work with s-dftd3. Please file an issue if you really want this capability. run_gcp will use classic gcp or mctc-gcp interchangeably, whichever you have available.

(#2619); * Adds an option to FREEZE_CORE called ""policy"", which enables frozen core settings to be looked up from a list specified in the global variable FREEZE_CORE_POLICY. This is more flexible than NUM_FROZEN_DOCC for situations like SAPT where multiple molecules are run in the same command and may require different individual numbers of frozen cores.

(#2689); * Standardizes the incfock implementation of DFJLinK toward the model of DFJCOSK, thereby improving memory usage. (#2792); * Standardizes the incfock implementation of DirectJK toward the model of DFJCOSK, thereby improving memory usage. (#2808); * Enhances the incfock implementation of DFJCOSK to be like the others: controlled by `INCFOCK` keyword (replacing `COSX_INCFOCK`), able to recompute the full Fock matrix every n iterations controlled by `INCFOCK_FULL_FOCK_EVERY`, and able to disable incfock at a certain `INCFOCK_CONVERGENCE` threshold.

Not an correctness issue (#2347).; - MBIS charges and volume ratios separated as OEProp tasks (#2273).; - Save gradient and Hessian results from finite difference more thoroughly in QCVars (#2293).; - Add DFTensor class for better recording and manipulating density cummulant theory (DCT) (#2250).; - Fix some memory leaks or memory mangement: DFT integration coordinates (#2352), `qcdb.BasisSet` (#2349), libmints (#2346), cubeprop (#2345).; - Prepare DIIS for moving to Python (#2298, #2327, #2350, #2325). ## Bug Fixes. - The performance improvement for exchange in range-separated functionals added in #1911 in v1.4 has been found to have correctness issues discussed in #2279. An internal library call was fixed in v1.4.1 with #2283, but some runtime conditions and BLAS calls still lead to errors, so the controlling wcombine option is disabled while under investigation in #2362.; - Fix mapping for DFT functional names for BrianQC jobs (#2357).; - Allow UHF gradients to be run on systems without beta electrons (#2344).; - Fix external potential + FISAPT results when moledule specified with units Bohr (#2331).; - Fix MCSCF final energy mismatch (#2259); - Fix SCF initialization so that linear dependencies get fed properly to FNOCC (#2302).; - Make Windows conda build more broadly runnable by altering ENABLE_XHOST option (#2292).; - Fix fractional occupation with symmetry (#2280, #2290).; - Fix print spacing in FCIDUMP files for 1e and 0e (#2277).; - Fix a bug where MOM could clear all electrons (#2270).; - Fix handling of frozen core orbitals in SAPT between monomer and dimer parts. Common case is when one monomer is an alkali cation (#2271). ## Contributors to v1.5. @andyj10224, @maxscheurer, @kis-gergely-dzsi, @alenaizan, @Icyyork, @konpat, @zachglick, @susilehtola, @brianz98, @je

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: ossible adjustment to environment keyword. (#2393); * Scalar Debye-based n-pole components QCVariables are retired, replaced by atomic-units arrays (e.g., `CC DIPOLE X` --> `CC DIPOLE`. (#2479); * External charges locations now always specified in Bohr, rather than units of molecule. Also, creation of QMMM object is discouraged. Instead, pass charges and locations through `external_potentials` keyword argument. (#2515); * In composite (CBS) methods, extrapolation functions like `corl_xtpl_helgaker_2` must be referred to as strings, not objects. User-supplied ones use NumPy arrays rather than psi4.core.Matrix objects and must be registered with a `register_xtpl_function` function call. In any inputs where the cbs() function was referred to as an object (e.g., `energy(cbs)`), it must now be referred to by string (e.g., `energy(""cbs"")`). Functions analogous to `sherrill_gold_standard` must be referred to as strings and registered with `register_composite_function`. Running old inputs will trigger update guidance. (#2526, #2532, #2575); * The default `energy(""sapt0"")` code changed its default density-fitting basis, so it's more physically correct and matches `energy(""fisapt0"")` values but no longer matches values reported from high-level SAPT methods. (#2582); * Hessian calculations no longer always evaluate gradient beforehand to test safety of projecting rotations. Instead assuming unsafe. Can pass `ref_gradient` array to test on or `set findif fd_project T/F` explicitly to control. (#2575); * Previously, the CBS wrapper issued a `clean()` btwn calcs. Plain ""string modelchem"" calcs like `energy('hf/cc-pvdz')` were getting caught and also being cleaned, meaning their behavior was slightly different than `set basis cc-pvdz \n energy('hf')`. Now, string modelchem calcs behave like ""set"" calcs, so for occasional string modelchem calcs (that is, `energy|gradient|hessian(""mtd/bas"")` only), you may need to add a clean in the input. Signatures of this problem are PSIO errors a

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content:  Wavefunction. (#2712, #2714); * Fixed insidious bug in Lebedev initialization that fails approximately once-in-a-thousand in parallel DFT runs. (#2743); * Fixed segfaults in `Matrix::transpose` and `Matrix::transpose_this` for matrices that are not totally symmetric. Now performs the transpose or raises an error messages, respectively. (#2740); * Fixed arbitrary order methods and MRCC methods to work with distributed driver. (#2731); * Fixed CBS extrapolated finite-difference Hessians crashing on molecules with zero dipole moment. (#2759); * Fixed so `basis_relativistic <name> {...}` now works. (#2764); * Fixed using multithreading with PK algorithm and small basis sets. (#2760, #2763); * Fixed a segfault caused by Libint2's engine.h being indirectly imported into mintshelper.cc. (#2770); * Raise an error when a user requests more roots of detci than there are determinants. (#2779, #2780); * Fixed a bug where UHF-CCSD properties were incorrect when some orbitals were singly occupied (#2818); * Previous to QCEngine v0.26.0 (now required), the pairwise dispersion analysis returned by executable/classic/psi4-channel dftd3 was scaled differently from that by s-dftd3 and dftd4 (any channel). This has been fixed. However, one must be consistent about QCEngine/Psi4/fsapt.py versions. A consistent set are QCEngine >=0.26.0 and Empirical_Disp.dat file generated in the course of energy(""fisapt0-d"") by v1.7 or later Psi4 and script fsapt.py released with Psi4 v1.7 or later. This is semi-enforced since v1.7 requires v0.26 (fsapt.py is a free agent). Another consistent set is QCEngine <0.26.0 and Psi4 and fsapt.py <v1.7. Mixing old Psi4 or fsapt.py with new QCEngine and classic dftd3 can yield wrong fisapt analysis, and this isn't trapped.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content: so it's more physically correct and matches `energy(""fisapt0"")` values but no longer matches values reported from high-level SAPT methods. (#2582); * Hessian calculations no longer always evaluate gradient beforehand to test safety of projecting rotations. Instead assuming unsafe. Can pass `ref_gradient` array to test on or `set findif fd_project T/F` explicitly to control. (#2575); * Previously, the CBS wrapper issued a `clean()` btwn calcs. Plain ""string modelchem"" calcs like `energy('hf/cc-pvdz')` were getting caught and also being cleaned, meaning their behavior was slightly different than `set basis cc-pvdz \n energy('hf')`. Now, string modelchem calcs behave like ""set"" calcs, so for occasional string modelchem calcs (that is, `energy|gradient|hessian(""mtd/bas"")` only), you may need to add a clean in the input. Signatures of this problem are PSIO errors and, in an obscure case, CC amplitudes being all zeros when called as mtd/bas.

(#2454, #2495); * A new logging file is added and default output file naming simplified at edge cases. Set different log level with `psi4 input.dat --loglevel=10`. The log file is the place to look for composite, finite difference, and manybody output. (#2512; #2575); * Allow JK screening to be SCF-iteration-dependent. Make derived JK classes responsible for zeroing their matrices. (#2529); * Add option to locate path to Python module from Psi4 executable: `psi4 --module`. (#2530); * Add QCVariables `FINDIF NUMBER`, `CBS NUMBER`, `NBODY NUMBER` to check how many jobs the wrappers are running. (#2544); * Use better driver-targeted (e.g., energy vs. findif freq) convergence criteria and determination of what analytic derivatives available.

Now one should call CMake directly using options and guidance in the first ~115 lines of top-level CMakeLists.txt.; * Switched Python binding of C++ from Boost Python to pybind11. Renamed Py-bound C++ library from ""psi4"" to ""core"". A consequence is that Psi4 now requires full C++11 compliance (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.3+, Apple Clang 6.1+, ICC 2016.0.2+). Note that ICC requires GCC and therefore GCC 4.9+. Note that PyBind11 adheres more to C-style than Python-style when it comes to references and pointer counting. As such, several functions required deep changes as internal references from C-side are no longer manipulatable Python-side.; * Added testing mode to see if Psi4 basically works when you turn it on. From a build directory, using CTest, `ctest -L smoke`. On any executable, using pytest, `psi4 --test`. On the python module, using pytest, `psi4.test()`.; * Reworked plugin system to CMake from GNUMake. Use `psi4 --plugin-compile` to generate Makefile rather than `psi4

This saves size (since NumPy also uses `mkl_rt`) and eliminates incorrect results and threading damping associated with multiple programs accessing BLAS/LAPACK from multiple sources (#748, #755).; - Psi4 no longer installs a non-standard gcc5.2 alongside Psi4 on Linux (or gcc feature on Mac). This was necessary when conda's default 4.8.5 was too low for Psi4's c++11 requirements, but since conda's default has leaped to 7.2.0, we use default again. Note that only libraries (e.g., `libstdc++`) are installed alongside Psi4 now, not compilers (e.g., `g++`).; - (generic, not psi4, conda) `conda activate env` works multishell, not just on `bash`. Since conda 4.4 c. Dec 2017. ### Known Bugs; - PCM-ROHF is broken. See #999; - ERD interface is broken and disabled

Can pass `ref_gradient` array to test on or `set findif fd_project T/F` explicitly to control. (#2575); * Previously, the CBS wrapper issued a `clean()` btwn calcs. Plain ""string modelchem"" calcs like `energy('hf/cc-pvdz')` were getting caught and also being cleaned, meaning their behavior was slightly different than `set basis cc-pvdz \n energy('hf')`. Now, string modelchem calcs behave like ""set"" calcs, so for occasional string modelchem calcs (that is, `energy|gradient|hessian(""mtd/bas"")` only), you may need to add a clean in the input. Signatures of this problem are PSIO errors and, in an obscure case, CC amplitudes being all zeros when called as mtd/bas. An example is shown below, collected by modifying steps 6 & 7 of `cbs-xtpl-energy-conv` test: (#2575). | | master (pre-v1.6) | ddd (v1.6) |; |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|; | set basis bas; energy(mtd); clean() | ok | ok |; | set basis bas; energy(mtd) | `PSIO_ERROR: (Incorrect block end address)` | `PSIO_ERROR: (Incorrect block end address)` |; | energy(mtd

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: ++ from Boost Python to pybind11. Renamed Py-bound C++ library from ""psi4"" to ""core"". A consequence is that Psi4 now requires full C++11 compliance (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.3+, Apple Clang 6.1+, ICC 2016.0.2+). Note that ICC requires GCC and therefore GCC 4.9+. Note that PyBind11 adheres more to C-style than Python-style when it comes to references and pointer counting. As such, several functions required deep changes as internal references from C-side are no longer manipulatable Python-side.; * Added testing mode to see if Psi4 basically works when you turn it on. From a build directory, using CTest, `ctest -L smoke`. On any executable, using pytest, `psi4 --test`. On the python module, using pytest, `psi4.test()`.; * Reworked plugin system to CMake from GNUMake. Use `psi4 --plugin-compile` to generate Makefile rather than `psi4 --new-plugin-makefile` as formerly. Plugin interface has been substantially renovated.; * Renamed plugin generation from, for example, `psi4 --new-plugin +wavefunction myplugin` to `psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template wavefunction`.; * Build performs pre-install to `BuildDir/stage/` so python driver _not_ being run from source. Use `psi4 --inplace` to run python driver from source.; * Switched versioning (e.g., 15 commits after tag v1.0 before tab v1.1rc1) from 1.0.15 to 1.1rc1.dev15.; * Reworked build documentation into documentation proper (http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_faq.html), making GitHub wiki defunct.; * Switched Python build detection from find_package(PythonLibs) to find_package(PythonLibsNew) CMake module used by NumPy and pybind11.; * Reworked ASCII scratch/output file names to incorporate job PID, just as binary scratch files do.; * Adjusts BLAS/LAPACK detection to detect OpenBLAS and to favor unified runtime library mkl_rt.so for MKL.; * Added internal `variables_` and `arrays_` std::maps for double and SharedMatrix types, respectively, to the Wavefunction class.

Modifiability,"lder specifying its build as a CMake External Project.; * Removed `setup.py` as user interface to CMake build. Now one should call CMake directly using options and guidance in the first ~115 lines of top-level CMakeLists.txt.; * Switched Python binding of C++ from Boost Python to pybind11. Renamed Py-bound C++ library from ""psi4"" to ""core"". A consequence is that Psi4 now requires full C++11 compliance (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.3+, Apple Clang 6.1+, ICC 2016.0.2+). Note that ICC requires GCC and therefore GCC 4.9+. Note that PyBind11 adheres more to C-style than Python-style when it comes to references and pointer counting. As such, several functions required deep changes as internal references from C-side are no longer manipulatable Python-side.; * Added testing mode to see if Psi4 basically works when you turn it on. From a build directory, using CTest, `ctest -L smoke`. On any executable, using pytest, `psi4 --test`. On the python module, using pytest, `psi4.test()`.; * Reworked plugin system to CMake from GNUMake. Use `psi4 --plugin-compile` to generate Makefile rather than `psi4 --new-plugin-makefile` as formerly. Plugin interface has been substantially renovated.; * Renamed plugin generation from, for example, `psi4 --new-plugin +wavefunction myplugin` to `psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template wavefunction`.; * Build performs pre-install to `BuildDir/stage/` so python driver _not_ being run from source. Use `psi4 --inplace` to run python driver from source.; * Switched versioning (e.g., 15 commits after tag v1.0 before tab v1.1rc1) from 1.0.15 to 1.1rc1.dev15.; * Reworked build documentation into documentation proper (http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_faq.html), making GitHub wiki defunct.; * Switched Python build detection from find_package(PythonLibs) to find_package(PythonLibsNew) CMake module used by NumPy and pybind11.; * Reworked ASCII scratch/output file names to incorporate job PID, just as binary scratch files do.; * Adjusts BLAS/LAPACK detect",plugin,MatchSource.RELEASES,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/releases/tag/v1.1:6474,plugin,6474,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/releases/tag/v1.1,1,['plugin'],['plugin'],"The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments.

Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: lder specifying its build as a CMake External Project.; * Removed `setup.py` as user interface to CMake build. Now one should call CMake directly using options and guidance in the first ~115 lines of top-level CMakeLists.txt.; * Switched Python binding of C++ from Boost Python to pybind11. Renamed Py-bound C++ library from ""psi4"" to ""core"". A consequence is that Psi4 now requires full C++11 compliance (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.3+, Apple Clang 6.1+, ICC 2016.0.2+). Note that ICC requires GCC and therefore GCC 4.9+. Note that PyBind11 adheres more to C-style than Python-style when it comes to references and pointer counting. As such, several functions required deep changes as internal references from C-side are no longer manipulatable Python-side.; * Added testing mode to see if Psi4 basically works when you turn it on. From a build directory, using CTest, `ctest -L smoke`. On any executable, using pytest, `psi4 --test`. On the python module, using pytest, `psi4.test()`.; * Reworked plugin system to CMake from GNUMake. Use `psi4 --plugin-compile` to generate Makefile rather than `psi4 --new-plugin-makefile` as formerly. Plugin interface has been substantially renovated.; * Renamed plugin generation from, for example, `psi4 --new-plugin +wavefunction myplugin` to `psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template wavefunction`.; * Build performs pre-install to `BuildDir/stage/` so python driver _not_ being run from source. Use `psi4 --inplace` to run python driver from source.; * Switched versioning (e.g., 15 commits after tag v1.0 before tab v1.1rc1) from 1.0.15 to 1.1rc1.dev15.; * Reworked build documentation into documentation proper (http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_faq.html), making GitHub wiki defunct.; * Switched Python build detection from find_package(PythonLibs) to find_package(PythonLibsNew) CMake module used by NumPy and pybind11.; * Reworked ASCII scratch/output file names to incorporate job PID, just as binary scratch files do.; * Adjusts BLAS/LAPACK detect

Performance,"c. the mainstays of driving calculations in PsiAPI.; * Added AO-based CASSCF.; * Reworked CI root indexing to use 0 as ground-state index, so now CI and CC use so the same indexing for PSI variables.; * Added atom- and AM-labels to printing of molecular orbitals.; * Reworked exiting so that if a geometry optimization exceeds maxiter, it no longer just prints a warning and exits sucessfully (beer) but now exits unsuccessfully (coffee) and raises a `psi4.ConvergenceError`.; * Reworked `psi4.set_memory()` to optionally take a string that includes a memory unit. Added a minimum memory (250MiB) and increase the default memory (500 MiB).; * Reworked parallelism control. Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS now ignored. Control parallelism in PsiAPI with `psi4 -nN` or in either mode through `set_num_threads(N)`.; * Reworked Psi variables in dfmp2 module so that duplicated in Wavefunction.get_variables() as well as `psi4.get_variables()`.; * Added printing of file and line origin for basis sets upon loading. Auxiliary basis sets now get a name (basis1 + basis2 for combination) rather than a blank. Auto-selection of auxiliary basis sets for >=5-zeta orbitals basis sets no longer defaults to def2-quad-zeta when an appropriate >=5-zeta auxiliary basis not available.; * Added new complete set of test case reference output files.; * Added BFDb databases.; * Reworked `print` in Psithon (input file syntax) to no longer process into `print_out` commands that redirect to output file. Now it means whatever your python print means.; * Added to Numpy integration the ability for `psi4.core.Matrix` and `psi4.core.Vector` to be converted to NumPy arrays and back.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: c. the mainstays of driving calculations in PsiAPI.; * Added AO-based CASSCF.; * Reworked CI root indexing to use 0 as ground-state index, so now CI and CC use so the same indexing for PSI variables.; * Added atom- and AM-labels to printing of molecular orbitals.; * Reworked exiting so that if a geometry optimization exceeds maxiter, it no longer just prints a warning and exits sucessfully (beer) but now exits unsuccessfully (coffee) and raises a `psi4.ConvergenceError`.; * Reworked `psi4.set_memory()` to optionally take a string that includes a memory unit. Added a minimum memory (250MiB) and increase the default memory (500 MiB).; * Reworked parallelism control. Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS now ignored. Control parallelism in PsiAPI with `psi4 -nN` or in either mode through `set_num_threads(N)`.; * Reworked Psi variables in dfmp2 module so that duplicated in Wavefunction.get_variables() as well as `psi4.get_variables()`.; * Added printing of file and line origin for basis sets upon loading. Auxiliary basis sets now get a name (basis1 + basis2 for combination) rather than a blank. Auto-selection of auxiliary basis sets for >=5-zeta orbitals basis sets no longer defaults to def2-quad-zeta when an appropriate >=5-zeta auxiliary basis not available.; * Added new complete set of test case reference output files.; * Added BFDb databases.; * Reworked `print` in Psithon (input file syntax) to no longer process into `print_out` commands that redirect to output file. Now it means whatever your python print means.; * Added to Numpy integration the ability for `psi4.core.Matrix` and `psi4.core.Vector` to be converted to NumPy arrays and back. Please see tests/numpy-array-interface for a full suite of examples.; * Reworked the finding of useful text files in /share/psi4/. Environment variable PSI4DATADIR is now defunct. PSIDATADIR remains but should not need to be used unless you want to specify one not adjacent to the built psi4/core.so library. Fo

Quality Attribute: Safety
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: keyword argument. (#2515); * In composite (CBS) methods, extrapolation functions like `corl_xtpl_helgaker_2` must be referred to as strings, not objects. User-supplied ones use NumPy arrays rather than psi4.core.Matrix objects and must be registered with a `register_xtpl_function` function call. In any inputs where the cbs() function was referred to as an object (e.g., `energy(cbs)`), it must now be referred to by string (e.g., `energy(""cbs"")`). Functions analogous to `sherrill_gold_standard` must be referred to as strings and registered with `register_composite_function`. Running old inputs will trigger update guidance. (#2526, #2532, #2575); * The default `energy(""sapt0"")` code changed its default density-fitting basis, so it's more physically correct and matches `energy(""fisapt0"")` values but no longer matches values reported from high-level SAPT methods. (#2582); * Hessian calculations no longer always evaluate gradient beforehand to test safety of projecting rotations. Instead assuming unsafe. Can pass `ref_gradient` array to test on or `set findif fd_project T/F` explicitly to control. (#2575); * Previously, the CBS wrapper issued a `clean()` btwn calcs. Plain ""string modelchem"" calcs like `energy('hf/cc-pvdz')` were getting caught and also being cleaned, meaning their behavior was slightly different than `set basis cc-pvdz \n energy('hf')`. Now, string modelchem calcs behave like ""set"" calcs, so for occasional string modelchem calcs (that is, `energy|gradient|hessian(""mtd/bas"")` only), you may need to add a clean in the input. Signatures of this problem are PSIO errors and, in an obscure case, CC amplitudes being all zeros when called as mtd/bas.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: l code and leaving each add-on with only a single-file build footprint in the external/upstream/ folder specifying its build as a CMake External Project.; * Removed `setup.py` as user interface to CMake build. Now one should call CMake directly using options and guidance in the first ~115 lines of top-level CMakeLists.txt.; * Switched Python binding of C++ from Boost Python to pybind11. Renamed Py-bound C++ library from ""psi4"" to ""core"". A consequence is that Psi4 now requires full C++11 compliance (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.3+, Apple Clang 6.1+, ICC 2016.0.2+). Note that ICC requires GCC and therefore GCC 4.9+. Note that PyBind11 adheres more to C-style than Python-style when it comes to references and pointer counting. As such, several functions required deep changes as internal references from C-side are no longer manipulatable Python-side.; * Added testing mode to see if Psi4 basically works when you turn it on. From a build directory, using CTest, `ctest -L smoke`. On any executable, using pytest, `psi4 --test`. On the python module, using pytest, `psi4.test()`.; * Reworked plugin system to CMake from GNUMake. Use `psi4 --plugin-compile` to generate Makefile rather than `psi4 --new-plugin-makefile` as formerly. Plugin interface has been substantially renovated.; * Renamed plugin generation from, for example, `psi4 --new-plugin +wavefunction myplugin` to `psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template wavefunction`.; * Build performs pre-install to `BuildDir/stage/` so python driver _not_ being run from source. Use `psi4 --inplace` to run python driver from source.; * Switched versioning (e.g., 15 commits after tag v1.0 before tab v1.1rc1) from 1.0.15 to 1.1rc1.dev15.; * Reworked build documentation into documentation proper (http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_faq.html), making GitHub wiki defunct.; * Switched Python build detection from find_package(PythonLibs) to find_package(PythonLibsNew) CMake module used by NumPy and pybind11.; * Reworked ASCII scratch/outp
