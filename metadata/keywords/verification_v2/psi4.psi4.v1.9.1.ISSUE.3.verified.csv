Deployability,"## Description; This PR adds a new psivariable, the overlap between the left and right CC eigenvectors. This was previously tested by `psitest.pl`, but promoting it to a psivar allows the standard `compare_values` machinery to test it. This PR integrates the new psivar into tests of `cc18`. This PR also removes the file `overlap_LAMPS.cc`, which was unused and differs from `overlap.cc` just by a search-replace on the name of the file to which quantities were being written.

Content: ## Description; This PR adds a new psivariable, the overlap between the left and right CC eigenvectors. This was previously tested by `psitest.pl`, but promoting it to a psivar allows the standard `compare_values` machinery to test it. This PR integrates the new psivar into tests of `cc18`. This PR also removes the file `overlap_LAMPS.cc`, which was unused and differs from `overlap.cc` just by a search-replace on the name of the file to which quantities were being written. This is PR 4 in an ongoing series to make `ccdensity` compatible with the standard `Matrix` and `Wavefunction` machinery used elsewhere in Psi. **Do not merge until** we have approval from @loriab and @lothian, as we are adding a new psivar to the `cc` mega-module.

Deployability,"## Description; This PR is a follow-up to https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2906, and what can be considered an official solution to the issue discussed in https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/2890. The current issue is that COSX does not work with certain grid configurations - specifically, it does not work with grids that have negative grid weights, due to the use of an intermediate matrix in COSX that uses the square root of negative grid weights. https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2906 ""fixed"" this issue by having COSX throw an exception when grids with negative weights were encountered. This PR provides a COSX reformulation that allows COSX to work with negative grid weights. The reformulation does two primary things:; - The $X$ matrix (Eq. 4 in [Neese 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphys.2008.10.036)) is redefined as $X_{\kappa g} = \sqrt{|w_{g}|} \kappa(r_{g})$.

Content: ## Description; This PR is a follow-up to https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2906, and what can be considered an official solution to the issue discussed in https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/2890. The current issue is that COSX does not work with certain grid configurations - specifically, it does not work with grids that have negative grid weights, due to the use of an intermediate matrix in COSX that uses the square root of negative grid weights. https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2906 ""fixed"" this issue by having COSX throw an exception when grids with negative weights were encountered. This PR provides a COSX reformulation that allows COSX to work with negative grid weights. The reformulation does two primary things:; - The $X$ matrix (Eq. 4 in [Neese 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphys.2008.10.036)) is redefined as $X_{\kappa g} = \sqrt{|w_{g}|} \kappa(r_{g})$. In words, $X_{\kappa g}$ now uses the square root of the _magnitude_ of the weights, instead of the square root of the raw weights.; - To correct for the above, the computation of the $G$ matrix (Eq. 7 in [Neese 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphys.2008.10.036)) is performed as $G_{\nu g} = \sum_{\tau} \text{sign}(w_{g}) A_{\nu \tau} (r_{g}) F_{\tau g}$ .

DirectJK and DFJLinK use the same incremental Fock build formalism, while DFJCOSK uses its own methodology. This introduces two problems:. 1. The next step of CompositeJK development is to combine DFJLinK and DFJCOSK into the pilot CompositeJK subclass. To ease this process, DFJLinK and DFJCOSK need to use the same incremental Fock process.; 2. The incremental Fock formalism currently used by DirectJK and DFJLinK has a couple of extra bells and whistles that DFJCOSK does not have - mainly, the ability to recompute the full Fock matrix every couple of iterations and the ability to disable incremental Fock construction entirely past a specific convergence threshold. These bells and whistles can greatly improve the convergence capabilities of the calculation, while ""normal"" IncFock implementations without these bells and whistles run the risk of greatly increasing the number of SCF iterations needed to converge.

Deployability,"## Description; This PR is designed to enable testing of a wide variety of combinations of `SCF_TYPE`, `SCF_SUBTYPE`, and `SCREENING` keywords available in Psi4. Of the currently-available JK tests, scf5 covers a wide variety of build methods, but only at a single screening type per method (density or csam, depending on the method). Meanwhile, `test_erisieve.py`, after the updates introduced in https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2973, tests a wide variety of screening types, but with limited testing in conjunction with different JK builds (the only tests that don't use the Python interface of `TwoBodyAOInt` directly, use `SCF_TYPE=DIRECT` or `DF` as the JK method for screening comparisons). This leaves a lot of untested JK build+screening combos, which may be potentially broken and uncaught by the CI as a result. As a matter of fact, such cases actually do exist in the code currently (e.g., CompositeJK methods + no screening). This PR adds a new pytest module, `test_comprehensive_jk_screening.py`. It is effectively an expanded version of the scf5 test module, testing one of the scf5 systems (singlet oxygen) with the same basis set, but also including different screening methods and algorithmic subtypes available in Psi4. Screening is assumed to have an insignificant impact on energy within the tolerance used, so all screening types for a given method use the same reference energy. Some combinations of method and screening type throw an exception by design; this is accounted for in the test by testing that such combinations do indeed throw an exception as expected. Other combinations of method and algorithm are broken at the moment and error out; these are simply skipped for now.

So, what this PR does, is add sanity checks to ensure that the COSX grids don't have negative weights, and throw an exception if they do.

Content: ## Description; This adds new DF basis files for dzvp. dgauss-dzvp-autoaux was generated using the autoaux program (courtesy Susi Lehtola). This is a short-term solution for the current problem that there is no working DF basis for dzvp, as it is an all-electron basis for elements going beyond Kr. dgauss-dzvp-mix contains a mixture of the previous default, def2-qzvpp-jkfit for H-Br, and dgauss-dzvp-autoaux for heavier elements. The purpose of this DF basis is to avoid the performance decrease (without affecting accuracy) that comes with using dgauss-dzvp-autoaux for all elements. `basislistother.py` has also been updated to use dgauss-dzvp-mix for jkfit and dgauss-dzvp-autoaux for rifit. ## Status; - [x] Ready for review; - [x] Ready for merge. ## Benchmark of basis sets and DF basis sets for conformational energies; [combined-results.pdf](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/files/6167929/combined-results.pdf)

The default is to capture 85% of the density, but the user can specify a different value with the new option `CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD`.

Deployability,"## Description; This is it. It's here. This PR is the initial implementation of the CompositeJK framework, the culmination of many, MANY of the JK-related PRs that are either in progress, or have been added to Psi4 already. Many methods have been added to Psi4's JK class which enable utilization of algorithms that build J or K separately to improve performance. The ones in Psi4 as of now are the JK subclasses DFJLinK and DFJCOSK, which, between the two, contain integral-direct density-fitted J construction, the Linear Exchange method (LinK), and the Chain-of-Spheres Exchange method (COSX). Further ones, such as the Continuous Fast Multipole Method (CFMM), are planned for the future, and even more (e.g., J-Engine, Local DF methods) exist beyond the work done in Psi4 for the past year. The problem is, Psi4's JK class does not have a framework that truly supports the existence of these separate J and K algorithms. DFJLinK and DFJCOSK work for now, given the low number of separate J and K algorithms current in Psi4. But, as more separate J and K algorithms are added to Psi4, the number of JK subclasses will skyrocket, assuming every combination of separate J and separate K algorithm is stored in its own JK subclass. This will lead to a nasty problem with code duplication, not even discussing the pollution of the JK hierarchy that would result. Thus, for continued research into separate J and K construction algorithms, a proper framework for supporting such algorithms is paramount. CompositeJK is that framework. CompositeJK is a single JK subclass which enables the combination and execution of any separate J and K build algorithm available in Psi4. CompositeJK can enable this without duplication of separate build algorithms across different subclasses.

This patch addresses some (but not all) issues raised in #2631 by allowing for more flexible policies to be set appropriate to multi-part calculations. . ## Todos; - [x] Add POLICY as option to FREEZE_CORE; - [x] Add global variable FREEZE_CORE_POLICY to hold custom frozen-core policy. ## Checklist; - [x] A functionality test for this flag has been added to `tests/dfmp2-ecp/input.dat`; - [x] `ctest -L quick` runs successfully, which includes the above listed test; - [ ] `ctest ` still in-flight but given the scope of this patch I don't expect any issues. ## Status; - [x] Ready for review; - [ ] Ready for merge

Deployability,"## Description; This produces a docs build with no warnings or errors, either overt (`make html -W`), external links (`make linkcheck`), or internal links (`make html -n`). requires a qcel docs update. hopefully this will provide a clean docs base moving forward. This PR is the controversial part of the docs technical refresh. I think there was some technical debt left over from the 2016 inversion in the module structure of the driver. What I think was happening was that the `psi4/driver/driver.py` was the nexus, and any wrappers or utilites that it happened to import became the API. The folder psi4/driver didn't really function as a module, and any `psi4.driver` was referring to driver.py, not psi4/driver/. Then for psithon, a few extras like frac got added in in the import preamble. Only problem with the structure (besides ppl who know python finding it irregular) is that it made some functions in the driver impossible to access (i.e., run `help()` on) and link to in the docs. https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-init-for-me-d70a312da583 outlines a few strategies for structuring python packages.

Content: ## Description; https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1439#issuecomment-455799123 is a good idea prototyped here. Instead of always defaulting the cast-up basis to 3-21g, choose from within family. Here, only def2 is rolled out. Also, not integrated with basis blocks, so active for `set basis def2-tzvpp`, not `basis {assign I def2-tzvppd}` in original example. ## Todos; Notable points (developer or user-interest) that this PR has or will accomplish.; - [x] basis guess default Dunning, Petersson (zapa), and Jensen families to `pcseg-0`, which is 3-21g sized. none of these are ECP; - [x] basis guess default Karlsruhe to `def2-sv(p)`, so that ECP present for both orbital and fitting; - [x] remainder (incl.

If I run this setup command:. ```; ./setup --prefix=$HOME/psi4-install \; -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=$HOME/anaconda/envs/psi4-py2.7/include \ ; -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=$HOME/anaconda/envs/psi4-py2.7/lib \; objdir; ```. I see boost 1.59.0 is detected. ```; -- Boost version: 1.59.0; -- Found the following Boost libraries:; -- filesystem; -- python; -- regex; -- serialization; -- system; -- timer; -- chrono; -- thread; -- Looking for MKL_Free_Buffers; ```. However the build will fail in the linking step with the same `undefined reference` errors as others have seen when trying to link against boost 1.60.0 #243 , #312 . Looking in `CMakeCache.txt` I see that the `Boost_INCLUDE_DIR` has been set correctly but the `Boost_LIBRARY_DIR` and all `Boost_XX_LIBRARY_...` paths have been set to the global boost install in `/usr/local` . ```; //Path to a file.; Boost_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/Users/admin/anaconda/envs/psi4-py2.7/include. //Boost library directory; Boost_LIBRARY_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/lib. //B

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: ### Upgrade Guide. * `property(...)` --> `properties(...)`; * If you have a (non-py-only) plugin, ; * Add `PSI_API` to your plugin code in [this pattern](https://github.com/edeprince3/v2rdm_casscf/commit/7d4507d8979b61b3333fc6ceab450a61392836ff); * If, upon rebuilding against psi4, you get symbol not found errors, run `c++filt` on the mangled symbol name, then add `PSI_API` to the psi4 repo to make sure the `core.so` you're linking against is exporting the symbol you need. See example [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/955). Or just file an issue with your lost symbol.; * Note that anyone wanting to re-use an objdir will need to **thoroughly** remove the old pybind11 v2.0.0 from detectability. This means:; * `<objdir> rm -rf stage/<TAB-TAB-...-TAB>/includes/pybind11`; * `<objdir> rm -rf stage/<TAB-TAB-...-TAB>/share/cmake/pybind11`; * `<objdir> rm -rf external/upstream/pybind11`; * Intel 2016 is no longer a valid compiler (doesn't work with py11 >=2.2.1)

Better for weak interactions, but no time savings/no screening); - [x] extends `DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME` keyword with:; - [x] Treutler grid pruning ``TREUTLER``; - [x] a more robust grid pruning variant of it ``ROBUST``; - [x] new variables: ``XC GRID TOTAL POINTS``, ``XC GRID SPHERICAL POINTS``, ``XC GRID RADIAL POINTS``; - [x] `print > 2` adds (existing but unused) debug grid print out; - [x] tight DFT tests are updated with new values due to the new Bragg-Slater radii used; - [x] testing and error overview; - [x] option to properly disable all pruning (currently only indirect way); - [x] tests below indicate a reduction of the grid size by 30 and 45% using `ROBUST` and `TREUTLER` pruning, respectively. This leads to a 15-20% speed up for small molecules.; - [x] the following tests have been updated because of the new BS radii: `dft-b3lyp`; `dft-custom-mgga`, `dft-grad-lr1`, `dft-grad-lr3`, `dft-grad-meta`, `dft-grad1`, `dft-grad2`, `dft-omega`, `dft-psivar`, `dft-vv10`, `dft1`, `dftd3-grad`, `dftd3-version`, `frac-traverse`, `opt13`, `pcmsolver-dft`, `pcmsolver-dipole`; - [x] new test: `dft-pruning`. ## Questions; - Pruning enabled by default? -> not this PR, but after further testing yes. ## Checklist; - [x] Documentation; - [x] Pruning Tests added; - [x] All relevant `ctests` pass; (http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_plannin

Compared to the reference from 2017, the first step has an energy difference on the order of 1e-4, and the energy difference remains at or below 1e-4 up to step 22. If I had to guess, this is due to PR #1663, where I fixed an error in the initial displacement for the IRC. At step 22, the geometry is very close to the minimum, so the next step ends up raising the energy. The two IRCs then bounce around, with the reference IRC bouncing in the fourth decimal place and the current IRC bouncing in the fifth. This is enough bounce for the final energies to be outside convergence criteria. Unless somebody has the time and drive to improve the IRC termination cutoff in C-Optking, I recommend changing the reference value for now and investigating this in Py-Optking, whenever that comes out. Meanwhile, I have most of the occ tests fixed locally, but `ocepa-grad2` is proving more difficult. My Psi4Numpy converges with no problems, so the issue probably isn't in the coupled-DIIS approach itself... My current guess is that it's the fact that the ""residuals"" `occ` throws into DIIS aren't the residuals but the residuals divided by the MPPT-like denominators from the standard amplitude update algorithm.",update,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1793#issuecomment-592806226:3006,update,3006,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1793#issuecomment-592806226,1,['update'],['update'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Compared to the reference from 2017, the first step has an energy difference on the order of 1e-4, and the energy difference remains at or below 1e-4 up to step 22. If I had to guess, this is due to PR #1663, where I fixed an error in the initial displacement for the IRC. At step 22, the geometry is very close to the minimum, so the next step ends up raising the energy. The two IRCs then bounce around, with the reference IRC bouncing in the fourth decimal place and the current IRC bouncing in the fifth. This is enough bounce for the final energies to be outside convergence criteria. Unless somebody has the time and drive to improve the IRC termination cutoff in C-Optking, I recommend changing the reference value for now and investigating this in Py-Optking, whenever that comes out. Meanwhile, I have most of the occ tests fixed locally, but `ocepa-grad2` is proving more difficult. My Psi4Numpy converges with no problems, so the issue probably isn't in the coupled-DIIS approach itself... My current guess is that it's the fact that the ""residuals"" `occ` throws into DIIS aren't the residuals but the residuals divided by the MPPT-like denominators from the standard amplitude update algorithm.

Deployability,"1. Psi doesn't tabulate these, and I've mostly seen them for DFT. Scaling factors handy for getting oriented with a vib spectrum, but they're not uniquely determined for a method/basis.; 2. Yes, IR intensities are available as of psi4 1.6 in late May provided analytic gradients are available (as opposed to Hessian by finite difference of energies).; 3. I'm not sure what ""mode"" you were looking at. I can clarify if you post a link. Once upon a time, there was a `frequency(..., mode=(continuous|sow|reap))` but that had to do with farming out finite difference jobs and is now defunct anyways.

Content: 1. Psi doesn't tabulate these, and I've mostly seen them for DFT. Scaling factors handy for getting oriented with a vib spectrum, but they're not uniquely determined for a method/basis.; 2. Yes, IR intensities are available as of psi4 1.6 in late May provided analytic gradients are available (as opposed to Hessian by finite difference of energies).; 3. I'm not sure what ""mode"" you were looking at. I can clarify if you post a link. Once upon a time, there was a `frequency(..., mode=(continuous|sow|reap))` but that had to do with farming out finite difference jobs and is now defunct anyways. There's `irrep` https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/driver/driver.py#L1511-L1517 that allows a partial frequency job for only a symmetry subset.

Deployability,"> Almost certainly what's going on is that a fundamental library (gcc, mkl are the usual suspects) is in conflict between jupyter's ldd and psi4's (envname/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages/psi4/core.so). The usual hack is to switch around import order between psi4, numpy, matplotlib, etc, until one works. Ah, I ran into this for the first time recently with another module. > Indeed, if I install psi4 the way you listed into p4env and then create another env into which I install jupyter (and same version of python; all from conda-forge) and then adjust the path (sys.path.append('/path/to/p4env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/), I can import psi4 just fine.

Content: > Almost certainly what's going on is that a fundamental library (gcc, mkl are the usual suspects) is in conflict between jupyter's ldd and psi4's (envname/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages/psi4/core.so). The usual hack is to switch around import order between psi4, numpy, matplotlib, etc, until one works. Ah, I ran into this for the first time recently with another module. > Indeed, if I install psi4 the way you listed into p4env and then create another env into which I install jupyter (and same version of python; all from conda-forge) and then adjust the path (sys.path.append('/path/to/p4env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/), I can import psi4 just fine.

Deployability,"> Good points. The code does run UHF/UKS as needed, and the MBIS routine can handle these cases as well. I have a few reference values for free atom volumes for elements H, Li, C, N, O, F, Ne, Si, S, and Cl, and we match these values. So I feel good about getting those ground states correct, but in general they many not be accurate, particularly for transition metals I'd imagine. I am inclined to trust the source of the ground state occupancy values from SAD, though. Note that SAD hasn't been using those values in a long time; instead it runs spin-restricted calculations. Also, SAD isn't symmetry aware at the moment, which is a problem especially for transition metals and lanthanides and actinides where e.g. the s and d orbitals are very close in energy and the energy differences between different configurations are just eV. The proper way to do it is to impose symmetry, so that the occupations can be controlled.

Content: > Hi @kzinovjev just checking over this again and noticed that the [populations](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/e105cc2346fba36ccacb77bf8944a3dcf6c097f2/psi4/src/psi4/libmints/oeprop.cc#L2099-L2104) and [widths](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/e105cc2346fba36ccacb77bf8944a3dcf6c097f2/psi4/src/psi4/libmints/oeprop.cc#L2182-L2188) might already be printed can you check they match what you are printing?. Hi @jthorton, currently only the atomic charges (so, the sum of populations of all the shells) and the widths of the last shell for each atom are printed. In contrast, with this patch the full result of MBIS density fitting is printed, so populations and widths of all the shells. This is helpful if one wants to split the atomic charges into core/valence shells, as in [MEDFF](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00969), [IPML](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5009502) or [EMLE](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00914) methods.

Also, I opened this PR early in order to a) Update the Psi developers on the progress of the new CFMM code, and b) To get y'all to start thinking about the future of the JK class, and potential design choices for if a user would like to run, per se DF-J + linK, CFMM-J + chain-of-spheres K, etc. Also, most of my ""non-sense"" PR messages result from the fact that I have to change branches, so I make a quick push to GH before I switch to another project, and can be safely ignored, as they don't mean anything. I will avoid doing such a thing in the future though, and add more descriptive Git messages :) However, the descriptive commit messages DO mean something.

Deployability,"> I don't know the DFT infrastructure at all, so can you give me a big picture overview of what this PR is doing? I know that DFT relies on numerical integration, and I know that a block contains numerical integration points, but I don't know what a block is used for. Instead of making a loop over all grid points that calculates basis function values and XC contributions one by one , the points are grouped together into blocks for efficiency reasons.; Currently there is no connection between a single grid point and the atom it originally belongs to. One block of points can even contain grid points from multiple atoms. This connection is lost immediately after the grid is constructed. Adding it back is a bit awkward and e.g. `remove_distant_points(extents_->maxR());` needs to be rewritten with the new data structure. This feature is needed for algorithms or methods that look at contributions from atoms when looping over the grid points. Right now, those new things are not needed, and thus not used anywhere, but they will be used for COSX and ddCOSMO. So you might want to access for a given atom all blocks of grid points, where a block has only grid points from that atom. This is what `atomic_blocks` provides. However that leads to a double-loop (see examples) and possibly worse parallelization. For a simple loop over all block, like what is used now, you want to know the atom to which the current block belongs (-> `parent_atom`) to collect values by atom. Two options the developers can chose from.

Content: > I just updated the docs too. One thing I am confused about, why is the `screening` keyword only in the sapt module?. Very good question. @zachglick [added the option](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/commit/e1977af9ae69b77ca518c3169efb23018b51ffb0), so perhaps he can shed some light on this one.

I guess we could in theory split the complete XC functionals exposed by libxc into the other categories, but this way they are all kept together and can be updated easier. So I guess if you want a hybrid, you have to check two files (as opposed to several), which is not that terrible. Yes, and hybrid metas one might look for in three files. Without merging all into one file, I agree the present organization is reasonable.

I was worried I may have misinterpreted your original question.

Other expansions that will be made to CompositeJK, such as CFMM, are not yet in Psi4 proper. CompositeJK will not touch other JK algorithms present in Psi4, such as DirectJK or the conventional DFJK algorithms. The original plan for CompositeJK, from many months ago, was to completely redo the JK hierarchy so that any J algorithm in Psi4 could be combined with any K algorithm. However, I was quickly convinced that this was a bad idea, because certain combinations of J and K from the entire Psi4 option list would not perform well. For example, we can see this even now, where the current LinK implementation is always run with DirectJK's formuation of J and thus displays poor performance. The current idea for CompositeJK, then, is that it will he a hub for the implementation of separate J and K build algorithms designed specifically for the construction of those matrices; e.g., Direct DF-J, LinK, COSX, CFMM.",integrat,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2762#issuecomment-1302518908:155,integrating,155,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2762#issuecomment-1302518908,1,['integrat'],['integrating'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Deployability,"> Would testing COSX results against the implementation in Orca 5 make sense? Of course the grid dependence makes such things tricky. Practically speaking, this should be doable, but one would need to ensure that as many factors between the two implementations as possible are standardized and made the same.

This question opens up the discussion to another approach I was thinking for this PR - using separate reference energies for COSX and LINK in the scf5 test, rather than comparing against canonical or DF energies. I am rather neutral on that matter, and am definitely open to doing so; but there are some concerns that should be considered with the separate reference energies approach. These are concerns that might not matter as much now; but the scf5 test will undoubtedly be expanded as CompositeJK and new separate J and K algorithms are added to Psi4, and these concerns might pop up then:. 1. Using separate reference energies for each CompositeJK JK build combination, for each O2 multiplicity and SCF reference, could quickly make scf5 quite unwieldy and messy. ; 2.

Content: > sigh We have test fail because adcc broke. I'm holding this PR innocent. Something is probably wrong with adcc itself. weird, it didn't install for that lane. adcc conda package hasn't changed in over a month. i'll try restarting that lane in case of fluke. otherwise, i'm guessing some non-qc dependency issue.

The monomer energies in the monomer basis sets need to be calculated so that we have total energies... trying to optimize the interaction energy only, without some special constraints in the optimizer to keep the monomers frozen (a capability we do not have automated right now), will give garbage. 99% of users will not be clever enough to realize that if they want the counterpoise-corrected geometry of a dimer, they need to include ""nocp"" in their bsse_type list.

Content: @andysim Yes. The 'installed' simint library should have a file `include/simint/vectorization/vector_config.h`. There is also one under the (simint) build directory under `stage`. This should define which vectorization you are using. @loriab Maybe you didn't completely clear out the build directory before switching the vectorization type? I still think that would work, though.

Deployability,"@hokru is quite right. You can get a tarball of any commit, tag, or release of any repository through GitHub. I'd strongly recommend doing a clone, rather than a tarball, so that you can update easily and do partial rebuilds. Even more strongly, I'd recommend you do something in the 1.1 release series, like 1.1a1 (if you really want a tag) https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tags because Psi4 has had its build system rewritten, has dumped boost, has switch from an executable to a library, and has had its git history rewritten after the 1.0 release (for all that, running it is exactly the same). Because of the history rewrite, I'm not even sure a 1.0 can be extracted from this repo (we've a plan to put up a separate 1.0 repo; Yes, there probably should be a big warning sign against trying to build 1.0 from existing repo). So, please clone and build HEAD, or clone and build 1.1a1 (if you prefer tags), or tarball and build 1.1a1 (if you must). The wiki for building is out of date. New instructions have been moved into the main documentation. That should get posted today, it was only committed yesterday. Even if you did just have a random git tag like e0a3ab, that gets translated into a sortable version (you can see yourself after cloning by running `python psi4/versioner.py`).

Content: @loriab Thanks for these comments!. I now have some simple documentation [for running Psi4 with MDI](https://molssi.github.io/MDI_Library/html/mdi_ecosystem.html#ecosystem_psi4) as part of the MDI_Library documentation pages. Its still very basic, but thankfully there isn't much more to the process than what is described in the [general MDI launch documentation](https://molssi.github.io/MDI_Library/html/library_page.html#library_launching_sec). I've tried to work on adding some how-to-use documentation to Psi4 proper, but I can't seem to get my Sphinx environment set up correctly:. ```; Building html documentation ...; Running Sphinx v2.2.0; making output directory... done; /Users/tbarnes/anaconda3/envs/psi4/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sphinx/events.py:103: RemovedInSphinx30Warning: autodoc_default_flags is now deprecated.

Deployability,@loriab ah! I didn't even check for `.a`s vs `.so`s. It looks like the conda recipe passes the shared flag to `b2` so I only had the `.dylib`s for almost all of the libraries. .

I am checking to make sure that compiles fine now. ( I have to admit I don't really know what the difference between `.so` and `.dylib` is but CMake seems to think the `.dylib`s are okay. . I also modified the recipe so I can build the `.a`s as well.

Content: @loriab, I noticed that you posted a fix for my Psi4/Cfour problem at https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2615. Thank you for that! As I understand correctly, you have the updated files using which all Cfour test jobs run successfully. If so, could you please help me which files have been modified, and from where I can download them?

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Deployability,"@medvedev-m, /tmp is just fine when it's big enough. Often, default Linux/Unix installations have only a limited amount of space available in /tmp. The singlet B atom computation you had crash is actually very small and doesn't require much space, so I think your /tmp must have been filled by some of your earlier computations that crashed. Many quantum chemistry programs, including Psi4, leave some of their temporary files around if they crash, so you have to delete them up to avoid filling the directory. Anything in /tmp should be automatically removed by the operating system, eventually, but I don't know how often that happens --- they might not be cleaned up that quickly. NFS-attached disks are very slow and you should never use them as scratch disks in a quantum chemistry computation. Otherwise, you'll cripple the network with all the data you're sending over it, people will have trouble accessing their files, and your system administrator will be very unhappy with you. So if /tmp is a problem and if NFS-attached disks are a problem, what do you do?

Content: @raimis Thanks very much - this is exactly the information I needed, and I've been able to reproduce the Azure DevOps results in my own tests. @dgasmith The Azure DevOps failures were associated with how the MDI Library compiles and installs DLL libraries. I've fixed the problems with the library, and all the tests are finishing successfully now. The relevant commits are [here](https://github.com/MolSSI/MDI_Library/commit/25cdcb30abfb4e13ced726249f619ef8acc19582) and [here](https://github.com/MolSSI/MDI_Library/commit/2ea5621ff3ee2020276c588a9962d756cc2cfb18). Thanks for your comments; I've incorporated them in the latest commits. @loriab Thanks very much for these comments. I'll try to address them soon.

Deployability,"@wpoely86 Yes one of the huge things I wanted to address with the new rewrite is the fact that things like CMAKE_C_FLAGS wasn't being respected. Admittedly we were ignorant of the CMake way to do things when we wrote the first pass. This second pass should be substantially more aligned with CMake philosophy, although by means of disclaimer I do not claim to be a CMake expert. . As for the plugin issue I suspect it will go away. I'm switching us to a superbuild strategy that relies on having things installed. Finally, the way we run tests has completely changed since the last time I tested them with MPI. Taking a quick glance at the scripts I think that the problem might be that the actual tests are run with a Python script and I suspect that the usual CTest options are not being passed to it.

Content: @wpoely86 Yes one of the huge things I wanted to address with the new rewrite is the fact that things like CMAKE_C_FLAGS wasn't being respected. Admittedly we were ignorant of the CMake way to do things when we wrote the first pass. This second pass should be substantially more aligned with CMake philosophy, although by means of disclaimer I do not claim to be a CMake expert. . As for the plugin issue I suspect it will go away. I'm switching us to a superbuild strategy that relies on having things installed. Finally, the way we run tests has completely changed since the last time I tested them with MPI. Taking a quick glance at the scripts I think that the problem might be that the actual tests are run with a Python script and I suspect that the usual CTest options are not being passed to it. For what it's worth, MPI has been removed from Psi4 in my rewrite. The idea going forward is to make plugins responsible for it; we have a similar strategy in Pulsar that I think works nicely.

The two offenders I've noticed are not updating the tau intermediate after a cumulant update and not re-computing the 1RDM and separable contributions to the energy after updating tau.

You can see both problems in the twostep algorithm. Even if it was recomputed, `dcft_compute_uhf:compute_energy_UHF` is never called until the next iteration of the loop either.

I've seen it myself with py38.

Then you can (1) maintain two channels for the two bases and mix them at the PYTHONPATH level, (2) start an env with a defaults + psi4 install, then install additional packages from c-f, (3) use an env spec file mixes a known safe combination of psi4 and c-f packages.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Ah, yes, c-f vs. defaults is a likely cause. There are a couple ways to deal with mixing psi4 and c-f deps, but none that's simple, robust, and a one-liner. Whatever you do, `blas=*=mkl` is a must with c-f and psi. Then you can (1) maintain two channels for the two bases and mix them at the PYTHONPATH level, (2) start an env with a defaults + psi4 install, then install additional packages from c-f, (3) use an env spec file mixes a known safe combination of psi4 and c-f packages. This is admittedly aggravating for an ordinary request. It should get better soon, as I'm working on c-f packaging (there have been dependency blocks up until about a month ago). I can try to interpret any roadblocks you hit in the meantime. > reluctant to have a separate conda installation).

Get some extra dependencies `conda install boost mpfr eigen ninja`. Only header-only parts of Boost are used. Eigen is needed for the l2 c++ interface. Ninja is because l2 now makes files with weird enough names that when the get written to `Makefile`s, `make` can't process them. EFV is strongly recommending Ninja, too. . 2. Make sure a Libint1 package is **not** in your conda environment. Even if you're properly pointing to a `Libint1_t`-modified l1 via `-DLibint_DIR`, the compiler will still find those conventional Libint1 headers in `$CONDA_PREFIX`.

I think I should flag @andysim here?. I'll continue with `wcombine` for my genrealized fix and I'm am happy to keep testing this weird job on the same machine as patches come down-the-line.

For instance, I can't use their `git` because I'm addicted to `git add -p`, and they don't build with perl enabled. There's ""features"" in the works to counteract this, but I can't suggest any other gcc right off.

Does it make sense to alias these; variables so either version works? Might be less confusing for people; consulting the EFP docs. I don't really like EFP_AI_XXX. I do like pre-pending with EFP so that all; EFP keywords start with that. But AI connotes Artificial Intelligence more; easily than ab initio, which I assume it's supposed to mean. I think I; like QM better. (EFP_QM_XXX). This makes sense in a QM/MM context, which; this basically is (EFP being a very advanced MM method). Additionally, I'm not sure the docs are not totally clear... I'm not; totally sure what this means:. /*- Do include polarization energy term in EFP computation? (QMEFP_POL c.; v1.1) -*/.

Content: Cool, glad to see these updates. Thanks for pinging me about the naming. I don't have a strong preference for POL vs IND. I suppose being; consistent with IND is a good thing. Does it make sense to alias these; variables so either version works? Might be less confusing for people; consulting the EFP docs. I don't really like EFP_AI_XXX. I do like pre-pending with EFP so that all; EFP keywords start with that. But AI connotes Artificial Intelligence more; easily than ab initio, which I assume it's supposed to mean. I think I; like QM better. (EFP_QM_XXX). This makes sense in a QM/MM context, which; this basically is (EFP being a very advanced MM method). Additionally, I'm not sure the docs are not totally clear... I'm not; totally sure what this means:. /*- Do include polarization energy term in EFP computation? (QMEFP_POL c.; v1.1) -*/. Is this the polarization of the EFP by the QM region, or the polarization; of the QM region by the EFP?. On Tue, May 1, 2018 at 10:38 AM, Lori A.

Deployability,"Dear Bartek,. FYI, I did some additional investigating and discovered that some problems were introduced in PSI4 regarding restarts. You do need to set ""force_restart true"" (that will be corrected in the next release), but you also need to specify the file numbers assigned to the binary files so that PSI4 knows where the necessary wfn data is stored. Normally the files are named using the process ID number of the psi4 parent process, which changes from run to run. However, for a restart, you need to tell PSI4 which number to use using the ""filename"" keyword. For example, if your binary files were named, e.g., psi.60235.h2o.35, the process ID was 60235. To restart, place the following line at the TOP of your input file:. filename 60235. If you also set force_restart = true, then the CC codes will try to grab the amplitudes from the appropriate file.

Content: Example; ```; molecule {; 0 1; Ne; }. set basis aug-cc-pV5Z; set dft_spherical_points 974; set dft_radial_points 450. camlda0 = {; ""name"": ""CAM-LDA0"",; ""xc_functionals"": { ""HYB_LDA_XC_CAM_LDA0"": {""use_libxc"": True} }; }; lda0 = {; ""name"": ""LDA0"",; ""xc_functionals"": { ""HYB_LDA_XC_LDA0"": {""use_libxc"": True} }; }; ```; I've just merged these into libxc master. The hybrid LDA family and these two functionals will appear in the next (major?) release. Unfortunately, these aren't available anywhere else, so I can't be 100% sure the functionals themselves are correct. I just checked that the energies appear to be sane, i.e. the Ne energy is somewhere around -128 hartree.

Can confirm this works. @loriab if you suggest any changes to the command below just let me know. ```docker; FROM continuumio/miniconda3:4.10.3; RUN conda install psi4=1.5 -c psi4 && \; conda install psi4::libint2=*=hc9558a2_9 pytest=5 psi4::pcmsolver=*=py39h6d17ec8_2 -c psi4; ```. > For solid reproducibility, the psi4conda installers have the advantage. What exactly do you mean by this? Is there a preferred way to install psi4 other than `conda install psi4=1.5 -c psi4`? Pardon my lack of depth with the nuances of conda distributions.

Content: Forewarning that the [documentation in occ/dfocc](http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/occ.html#) needed reworking even _before_ this commit, and it certainly will afterwards. I'll hold off on rewriting that (and updating the `driver.energy` docstring) until the rest of the PR looks good. How I decide to rewrite the manual will depend on if I need to make other changes, and the docstring updates will depend on the manual changes... Aren't dependencies fun?

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Functionals now takes advantage of polarized vs unpolarized DFT kernels.; - Added generalized solvers in p4util/solvers.py. These include DIIS and conjugate gradient; - New density-fitted AO->MO transform object. More efficient than previous objects and has multiple modes depending on the type of computation (direct or AO storage).; - ECP SCF energies.; - ECP gradients by finite differences in Python.; - DFT is now has several hundred tests against Psi4 and other implementations; - Shared pointers were rewritten to use `std::make_shared`. (#836); - One-electron integrals from LibMints now properly apply external potentials so that external potentials are now applied evenly throughout the code base (#844).; - Psi4 is now buildable with Ninja (#794); - Begins to deprecate `char *` from Psi4 (#780); - Pragma header for diagnostics and API's (#774); - Improved C++/Python binding docstrings (#761); - Clang and YAPF configuration files (#753); - Improved parallel and routine timing information in Psi4 (#743); - SCF can now be run in symmetry for post-SCF modules that do not use symmetry (#737); - Psi4 now compiles much faster (~3 minutes with LLVM on 4 cores) (#736); - NumPy views of Psi4 objects are now correctly reference tracked in cases where C++ returns a new matrix. `arr = wfn.Ca_subset(""AO"", ""OCC"").nph` now no longer give noise. (#736); - Basis PyParsing is now simpler and code duplication has been removed (#734 ); - Update cc-pVXZ and add cc-pwCVXZ for Li, Be, Na, Mg (#728); - MCSCF orbital semicanonicalization (#722); - C++ Options are now exposed to Python (#720); - Intermediate sub-system and partial-basis energies from `nbody` wrapped exported as psivars (#952); - Better start/stop/elapsed time printing. # Documentation; - Additional Documentation Information (#787). # Miscelaneous; - Added N to ANO0 basis set (#825). # Bug Fixes; - Accidental signed integer overflow when using extremely low memory in DFJK; - wB97X had an incorrect range-seperation parameter.
