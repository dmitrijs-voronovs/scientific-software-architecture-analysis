Deployability,"Hello Psi4. I have been doing some `oeprop` calculations and noticed that the `oeprop` module is case-sensitive, meaning some properties are not computed if requested from `oeprop` in lower case. Perhaps it is a common knowledge, but since this was not mentioned in the `oeprop` documentation - I bring it here. However, my issue is related to `MBIS_VOLUME_RATIOS`. When given in lower case to `oeprop` - Psi4 performs free-atom calculations for each atom type in the molecule (confirmed by `.log` file contents too), but does not perform (or at least does not print) the MBIS volume ratios. Thus, it seems like it does some premilinary MBIS calculations to get free-atom volumes, which is a bit surprising since I would expect it to ignore the `mbis_volume_ratios` option whatsoever (since it's lower-case). When given in upper case - Psi4 runs and prints as expected. The issue is really when the option is given in lower case. Observed with both Psi4 v.1.8 and 1.8.2 installed via `conda-forge`.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Hello, . When building psi4 from source and python development packages are not installed compilation fails (Linux Fedora). Once I installed python-dev all complete successfully.; The complaint from source files was along the lines. #include<Pyhon.h> not found and then aborts during compilation,. Ideally (IMO) cmake should check during the configuration phase if all relevant and required package are installed and abort if not. Perhaps there are more dependencies, but I may already have had them already installed. . I no longer have the build machine to replicate all the steps, but I suspect amending the root cmake adding find_package with python-dev as REQUIRED (or perhaps via pkg_config) ; and abort immediately during the cmake configuration phase if not found, not halfway through the compilation when running make. Perhaps this will also help. https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html. Cheers.

Content: Hi @loriab @dgasmith,. Sorry I didn't update. I was able to compile the C code that I wanted using the newest gcc packages from conda (gcc_linux-64). From my side is all fine except that when we depend on psi4, we bring all its dependencies with us, and I was wondering if this gcc version differences may cause problems down the line. If you guys make psi4 work with the default gcc from conda, that would be ideal, but I am no one to ask for that from you guys :) you already do a very good job. I think that's all. Feel free to close this if you feel it makes no sense to continue open. Cheers,; João

Deployability,"Hi loriab,. Thank you for your reply. On our HPC cluster, we do not update software. If there is a newer version of a software, we do an additional installation next to the existing version. For us it is important to provide continuity to the researchers. If data is published and a year or two later a researcher for some reason needs to reproduce a calculation, we would like to provide exactly the same software version that was used for the first run. Since that means that we have a lot of versions installed for a certain softwares, there needs to be a transparent way to distinguish the versions (and it should be obvious to the user, which version he is using). Tags sounds like a good solution for the installations that I am doing.

An issue: different results are printed when running the attached files: ; a) python tst.py; It prints [ 2.00000335e+00 2.00000331e+00 ..... -6.65828772e-04 -2.38015245e-03]; for the custom output which I request; (notice that tst.py is attached as tst.py.txt); [tst.py.txt](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/files/1790987/tst.py.txt). b) /opt/anaconda3/bin/psi4 file.dat; which prints; [ 1.99922250e+00 1.99922249e+00 ....... -6.83682794e-04 -2.43598746e-03] ; (notice that file.dat is attached as file.dat.txt); [file.dat.txt](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/files/1790991/file.dat.txt). There is a clear difference in first two values, although tst.py is almost **identical** to file.dat !. PS. Psi4 was installed via Anaconda.

Deployability,"Hi!; thank you, this is an interesting point and I am sure other code developers will raise the same issue. One of the main goals of TREXIO is to make it easy for different codes to exchange data. However, I understand that Psi4 may have specific needs that may not be included in the current version of TREXIO. One solution could be to use HDF5 for temporary files and store the final results with TREXIO. . But:; a better option is to fork TREXIO and extend it to fit Psi4's specific needs.; You could add your personal temporary arrays in a specific group named `psi4` for example, and link your own library with psi4. Additionally, if any modifications prove to be useful to other codes, they can be submitted as pull requests to the official library. The good thing with this strategy is that as long as you don't remove anything from the `trex.org` file, the files that you will produce will be detected as valid TREXIO files. Of course, there will be no way to access your specific data with the official library, but the files will be compatible with both the official and the custom library. @q-posev : We could think of a mechanism to generalize the possibility to extend the library for private data. Instead of reading only `trex.json`, we could let the script handle multiple json files to allow users to extend the library with custom groups. It could probably be integrated at the level of the configure script. In this way, @JonathonMisiewicz would only need to keep a JSON file in the git repo of psi4 to extend TREXIO instead of maintaining a fork of TREXIO and keeping his fork in sync with the official one.",integrat,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/2847#issuecomment-1396161906:1378,integrated,1378,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/2847#issuecomment-1396161906,1,['integrat'],['integrated'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Quality Attribute: Deployability

Content: Hi, I created brand new `conda` environment and then installed `psi4` with:. ```; conda install psi4 psi4-rt python=3.6 -c psi4; ```. and then tried to run a test input, like so:. ```; # Any line starting with the # character is a comment line; #! Sample HF/cc-pVDZ H2O computation. memory 600 mb. molecule h2o {; O; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; energy('scf'); ```. I receive a segmentation fault and see the following Traceback:. ```TraceBack; psi4 test.in test.out; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/xxx/anaconda3/envs/psi4/bin/psi4"", line 177, in <module>; import psi4; File ""/xxx/anaconda3/envs/psi4/lib//python3.6/site-packages/psi4/__init__.py"", line 82, in <module>; from .driver import endorsed_plugins; File ""/xxx/anaconda3/envs/psi4/lib//python3.6/site-packages/psi4/driver/endorsed_plugins.py"", line 33, in <module>; import v2rdm_casscf; File ""/xxx/anaconda3/envs/psi4/lib//python3.6/site-packages/v2rdm_casscf/__init__.py"", line 45, in <module>; psi4.core.plugin_load(sofile); RuntimeError:; Fatal Error: load_plugin: Cannot open library: core.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory; Error occurred in file: /scratch/psilocaluser/conda-builds/psi4-multiout_1563933640427/work/psi4/src/psi4/libplugin/load_plugin.cc on line: 52; The most recent 5 function calls were:. forrtl: severe (174): SIGSEGV, segmentation fault occurred; ```.

Content: Hmmm. The fnocc2 can be explained by the following diff.... ```; -energy('g2'); -refg2 = -76.332048016380 #TEST; -refgibbs = -76.349644827450 #TEST; +energy('g2',dertype=1); +refg2 = -76.332048079709 #TEST; +refgibbs = -76.349644891507 #TEST; ```. that was part of my last set of commits. I updated the reference values to reflect that I'd switched to analytic Hessians. Then when I committed it, I realized that analytic Hessians require angular momentum beyond what Travis can handle, so I switched back to finite differences but forgot to roll back the reference values. Feel free to revert the reference values, and that'll be fine. The other two problems appear to be a seg fault, so I'll try to check out your changes and see if I can reproduce. Sorry for the hassle.

Thus, I think it's best to drop tracking it and see that it gets cleaned up when distclean runs. That directory doesn't need an ascii index when a formatted html index exists. Our original plan was to web-host docs for each public release of the code, but admittedly, even I can't find the address of the older versions just now. If you want to package up a thousand html files, we'll try to remove the minor obstacles.

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: I had a bit of time to work on Windows build. Current status of dependencies:; - *libint*: with some hacking (https://github.com/raimis/libint/tree/win) I have manged to build it (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/raimis/libint). There are no tests, so high probability of not detected issues.; - *libxc*: with some more hacking (https://github.com/raimis/libxc/tree/win) I have to managed to build it too (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/raimis/libxc).; - *gau2grid*: it need just a few changes (https://github.com/raimis/gau2grid/tree/win) to compile (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/raimis/gau2grid). Though I have not managed to make the test to work. It seems, `ctypes` behave differently on Windows. Finally, I have reached a point to stat building *Psi4* (https://github.com/raimis/psi4/tree/win) and got stuck with MKL configuration and other `cmake` related problems (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/raimis/psi4). @loriab, for Linux builds, do you use MKL from `conda` or install it manually?

Deployability,I think I found out what is going on. Both ORCA and PSI4 are indeed writing the wrong contraction coefficients. I've done the same computation with Gaussian. Then I loaded the Gaussian log file into molden and wrote out a molden file. That one can be loaded back as an input for molden and it gives the right Mulliken charges:. N 0.0380; H -0.2742; H 0.0121; H 0.2242; Sum of Mulliken Charges: 0.0001. It seems that the the molden format uses exactly the same normalization conventions of Gaussian. (Gaussian prints the same contraction coefficients in the log file when the gfinput option is used.) These number seem to follow the same conventions as the Gaussian94 basis set format. (See the EMSL database for some examples.). I've update the archive file:. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4871688/moldenbug.tar.bz2.

This way there's a quick turnaround between edit/make/test. I don't see anything necessarily wrong with what you posted. The above is just a setup that can reduce confusion if you forget the install step.

Content: Installing `psi4` via `conda`/`mamba` with:. ```; $ mamba create -n psi4-env -c conda-forge -c conda-forge/label/libint_dev psi4; ```; when the env directory is in a symlinked directory, such as on an HPC cluster where `/home` is a symlink, gives something like the following when attempting to run `psi4`:. ```; $ mamba activate psi4-env; $ psi4 --version; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/lila/home/dotson/mambaforge/envs/psi4-env/bin/psi4"", line 205, in <module>; with (psi4_module_loc / ""metadata.py"").open() as fp: verline = fp.readline(); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; File ""/lila/home/dotson/mambaforge/envs/psi4-env/lib/python3.12/pathlib.py"", line 1014, in open; return io.open(self, mode, buffering, encoding, errors, newline); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/lila/home/conda/feedstock_root/build_artifacts/psi4_1698452227439/work/build/stage/lib/python3.12/site-packages/psi4/metadata.py'; ```. Working with @bennybp to troubleshoot, it appears that adding use of `.resolve()` to [these Path constructions](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/e3d46319d3a11d571c1c362eeaf7f6641978515c/psi4/run_psi4.py#L129-L131) solves this issue. This resolves (heh) the mismatch that otherwise happens between the paths that were `.resolve()`ed and these that weren't, which causes problems further down.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: It depends on which ones you're targeting and how you're getting psi4. If you're building from src, you'd `-D ENABLE_<addon>=ON` as described here https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L69-L108 . (Note that ""addon""s is what you'd want to search; ""plugins"" are different in psi4.). If you're using the conda binary, it varies by the nature of the addon. Addons that have to be enabled/disabled at psi4-build-time tend to be already in the psi4 binary. Unfortunately CheMPS2 is one that hasn't been transitioned to conda-forge yet due to license issues. You could grab psi4 v1.7 to use it. Ambit is available to install from c-f. Other addons that psi4 doesn't need to know about at compile time, like cppe or dftd3, can be conda installed at any time. That's the general picture. I can probably help on specifics if you run into difficulties.

Deployability,"It’s not really an SVN/CVS thing, IMHO. We were using Git for a very long time before making the public/private split and the core developers are extremely familiar with Git’s distributed nature. The old way of developing Psi was to have a private repo (which used to be CVS, then SVN, then Git/SVN, before switching completely to Git) and to only release static tarballs every now and then. Lori touched on the reason for the private repo - we need to be able to collaborate with each other but don’t want to release certain features until we’ve been able to write them up and test them. The idea of having the private repo be a local one is fine if you’re working in isolation, but most of our code is developed collaboratively so we need a central place, like GitHub, to be able to store the repo. Adding a public mirror was just a convenient way to provide more timely updates than static releases, and we have not been diligent enough in keeping this synced up. If GitHub were to allow more fine-grained control of branch access, perhaps we could collapse down to one repo. As things stand, I think that removing the private repo would prevent people from working together on new features that are to be released at a later date. These issues were mooted a few years ago when we set the dual repo system up. If there’s been a GitHub update in the intervening time that allows more fine-grained access, or if anybody has a better idea that doesn’t interrupt our workflow, then we’re always open to suggestions.
