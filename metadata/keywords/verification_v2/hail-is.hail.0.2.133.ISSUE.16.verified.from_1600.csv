Content: Again, [looking at utilization](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/builder/982ec67a-4b20-4901-a0aa-af418813a9c4?project=hail-vdc&dashboardBuilderState=%257B%2522editModeEnabled%2522:false%257D&timeDomain=1m&f.rlabel.namespace_name=default&f.umlabel.app=batch-driver), the driver is generally not using its full request. The Python spikes are maybe 35% of utilization and the nginx spikes are maybe 15%. I set the requests to around the top of these spikes. That should ensure that normal daily load is handled without scale up, but during low periods we can pack much better. cc: @jigold

Performance,"Ah, I understand. You're correct that pushing to the `cache` tag disassociates that tag with any image that was previously associated with it. That image is still in the registry though. I thought that was sufficient for the cache to work. (I was wrong, see below!). AFAICT, this change doesn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag.

Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: Am I strange in that I want to name something what it is (ci, batch, etc.) rather than give everything codenames? The purpose of codenames is to hide and obscure, you know. I think this should be called tutorial. And when it becomes a notebook service, notebook. And when it becomes the Hail service, it should just be the main website. The landing page should be password protected. We should think about whether we want to collect additional information there (e.g. email), although for now I don't think we need to, as everyone who signed up for the next tutorial filled out a questionnaire. I'm getting proxy timeouts. We need an ready endpoint and something on the client side to poll and redirect. Actually, awesome if it doesn't poll but uses, say, websockets, and the server watches the pod for a notification for k8s (or does this and also polls, which seems to be our standard pattern). Should we have an auto-scaling non-preemptible pool and schedule these there? If we do that, to optimize startup time, we should have imagePullPolicy: Never and then pull the image on startup and push it on update. When do you reap jupyter pods? jupyterhub has a simple management console that lets you shut down notebooks. > figure out how to teach flask url_for to use a root other than /. I don't think you can do this dynamically using headers. Blueprints seem to be the answer in Flask: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18967441/add-a-prefix-to-all-flask-routes/18969161#18969161. Is there a reason you didn't make it a subdomain? I thought we decided we preferred that.

Alex Kotlar: What is our long term plan for load* methods, and do we need their region parameterizations? I would love to understand the design proposal for these methods, in part because I want to document our allocation strategy in the ptype design doc (or maybe in a new design doc for regions). Observations:. Methods like loadElement (PContainer and inheritors) and loadField (PBaseStruct and inheritors) have region-taking parameterizations, but these methods are always wrappers for non-region parameterization (e.g loadElement(region, offset, idx) = loadElement(offset, idx)), which makes sense since our ""offsets"" are now memory addresses in these cases (can be read without knowledge of the region that allocated that memory). I believe historically these were really offsets into a region, requiring that region to load it.

In both cases, regenerating that file (either in CI as part of the deploy.yaml target or on a cluster for `install-on-cluster`) could cause a dataproc cluster running with untested dependency versions even if the requirements.txt files are unchanged. I do, however, require that the pinned-requirements files be compatible using the same check we do in CI. I performed the following manual testing:; 1. Creating a dataproc cluster through `hailctl dataproc start`; 2. ssh'ing into said cluster, cloning this branch and running `make -C hail install-on-cluster` to completion; 3. Updating the requirements.txt file to something incompatible and successfully installing on cluster again with updated pinned requirements. However, I'm not sure I'm actually doing this right. I checked that in step 2 I was *not* regenerating any pinned-requirments files, but in step 3 make updated the pinned requirements without me telling it to, I'm guessing because of the wheel's dependence on `PY_FILES` and I changed the source under hail/python.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: Because of the unpredictable way that git clone might realize the requirements files, I removed the pinned-requirements file as a dependency of the changed targets. In both cases, regenerating that file (either in CI as part of the deploy.yaml target or on a cluster for `install-on-cluster`) could cause a dataproc cluster running with untested dependency versions even if the requirements.txt files are unchanged. I do, however, require that the pinned-requirements files be compatible using the same check we do in CI. I performed the following manual testing:; 1. Creating a dataproc cluster through `hailctl dataproc start`; 2. ssh'ing into said cluster, cloning this branch and running `make -C hail install-on-cluster` to completion; 3. Updating the requirements.txt file to something incompatible and successfully installing on cluster again with updated pinned requirements. However, I'm not sure I'm actually doing this right. I checked that in step 2 I was *not* regenerating any pinned-requirments files, but in step 3 make updated the pinned requirements without me telling it to, I'm guessing because of the wheel's dependence on `PY_FILES` and I changed the source under hail/python. So I don't entirely understand why I have this desirable result.

Performance,"Ben submitted a pipeline where the first 85% of jobs run in us-central1 while the last 15% run in us-east1. The autoscaler only looks at the head of the job queue and then sorts the result set to figure out the regions to spin up instances in.

Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: Both of these were noted by Bernick as a part of his security review. 1. `local_infile`: if this is on, a client could in theory read any file on the instance by loading it into a table.; 2. `skip_show_database`: this disables `SHOW DATABASES` by default; we can still grant certain users (e.g. the admin-pod) the `SHOW DATABASES` privilege. A bit of security by obscurity, IMO, but it does not bother me much. I can always see the list of databases via the GCP console.

Content: CC: @danking . I tested this change works by replicating Lindo's job download (~80 Gi) on an overloaded node with 8 simultaneous jobs trying to download data in parallel. Before this proposed change and after I fixed some other issues in #10522, 75% of his jobs would fail with this error (the ones I presume on the persistent SSDs rather than the local SSDs):. ```; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.7/runpy.py"", line 193, in _run_module_as_main; ""__main__"", mod_spec); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.7/runpy.py"", line 85, in _run_code; exec(code, run_globals); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/batch/copy/__main__.py"", line 34, in <module>; asyncio.run(main()); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.7/asyncio/runners.py"", line 43, in run; return loop.run_until_complete(main); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.7/asyncio/base_events.py"", line 587, in run_until_complete; return future.result(); concurrent.futures._base.CancelledError; ```.

Performance,"CHANGELOG: Eliminate quadratic behavior in `BlockMatrix.to_matrix_table_row_major`. Users should expect significant reduction in run-time. There are two significant changes in this PR:; - Teach `LZ4InputBlockBuffer` how to skip bytes without decompressing every block, and; - Teach BlockMatrix to use a small cache of rows when converting from a BlockMatrix to a row-wise RDD. ### Blocked LZ4 Byte Skipping. We compress in blocks of 16 KiB. The blocks begin with an 32-bit integer indicating the decompressed length. When we're skipping large numbers of bytes we can request an `LZ4InputBlockBuffer` to skip decompression if the entire block will be skipped. ### BlockMatrix Blocks to Rows Caching; Currently, for every row in every block, BM opens a file, skips to the appropriate location, reads that one row, writes it into an RVB, and then closes the file. This has terrible cache and I/O performance. Instead, we allocate 32 MiB to cache the rows of each block. We divide the cache evenly across all rows. The new implementation requires the cache can at least fit one row of the block, with 32 MiB we're good up to ~4 million (total) columns. We'll need to reimplement this to also use a tree-aggregate long before we get to 4 million columns. ### Benchmark Results.

In particular, the folder `/foo/bar/baz/`'s basename is *not* `''` it is `'baz'`.

The latter, `sync.py` is simple: it delegates to our existing copy infrastructure. That copy infastructure has been lightly modified to support this use-case. The former, `plan.py`, is a concurrent file system `diff`. `plan.py` generates and `sync.py` consumes a ""plan folder"" containing these files:. 1. `matches` files whose names and sizes match. Two columns: source URL, destination URL. 2. `differs` files or folders whose names match but either differ in size or differ in type.

In case you know the aggregation is very slow and should be parallelized, use mt.cols().aggregate instead. Most of the time, `aggregate_cols` will be much faster performing the aggregation locally.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: CHANGELOG: MatrixTable.aggregate_cols no longer forces a distributed computation. This should be what you want in the majority of cases. In case you know the aggregation is very slow and should be parallelized, use mt.cols().aggregate instead. Most of the time, `aggregate_cols` will be much faster performing the aggregation locally. Currently, we generate a `TableAggregate` over a `TableParallelize` of the columns. We shouldn't try to optimize that to a local computation during compilation; `TableParallelize` should express the intent that the computation is expensive and really should be parallelized. This should be considered part of the semantics the compiler must preserve.

Instead of matching against very specific patterns, and failing completely for things that don't quite match (e.g. an input is let bound, or the fold implementing ""locus is contained in a set of intervals"" is written slightly differently), this uses a standard abstract interpretation framework, which is almost completely insensitive to the form of the IR, only depending on the semantics.

At the top level, the analysis takes a boolean typed IR `cond` in an environment where there is a reference to some `key`, and produces a set `intervals`, such that `cond` is equivalent to `cond & intervals.contains(key)` (in other words `cond` implies `intervals.contains(key)`, or `intervals` contains all rows where `cond` is true). This means for instance it is safe to replace `TableFilter(t, cond)` with `TableFilter(TableFilterIntervals(t, intervals), cond)`. Then in a second pass it rewrites `cond` to `cond2`, such that `cond & (intervals.contains(key))` is equivalent to `cond2 & intervals.contains(key)` (in other words `cond` implies `cond2`, and `cond2 & intervals.contains(key)` implies `cond`).

From small tests, the autoscaler query seemed much better, but I'll want to do one last load test once you're okay with this approach.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Output your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""
}
