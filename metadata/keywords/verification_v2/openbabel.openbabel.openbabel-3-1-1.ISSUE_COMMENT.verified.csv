When you say you installed openbabel and subsequently pybel do you mean [this](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/pybel)?; If so then that package is unrelated. The pybel module you want is included in the openbabel package (If installing manually its usually just a flag to include the python bindings). You could verify you have pybel by going to the openbabel install location and looking for the pybel.py script. I think I saw somewhere that having both pybel modules caused problems for some people. I'm having trouble understanding when you say ""these errors come about after compiling with pyinstaller but the program works before compiling"" you then say ""but I can reproduce the errors with the interpreter and simple code""; so does the script work on its own or not?. If you can find pybel once and it works, then that suggests to me that whenever it is not you might be using a different virtual environment where it is not installed. Do you know if the pyinstaller is running in the same virtual environment that your conda is using?. You saying it is not working for Windows or MacOS seems to suggest there may be an issue with the conda-forge repo/install process. However, you say that it works sometimes? So I am not sure.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: In this highly simplified case, I would expect the output to be just one line, C=COC=C, both with and without the -c flag. In the general case, the line returned with the -c option must be a member of the set of lines which are returned without the -c option. Also, your prior patch has gotten mangled by the markdown. Is the only change to reverse the sense of the 'if' test? If so, doing that causes the 'make test' test suite to fail, but without a useful error message.

Availability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib.

The failure of All Chemical Formats ; seems to be to a 256 character limit on the filter string ; and has only come to light when all the formats were ; included. Why this should occur needs tracking down. (5) illustrates a UI dilemma. Should ; a)the type of file requested, or ; b)the extension of the file selected by the user ; have priority on what format OB attempts to convert.

I'm not sure ... but I had that file [since 2014](https://github.com/aminophen/chemobabel/tree/71b8511ae44f981122747c22366a1c985d1a11c9/doc/chemobabel/draw) (when I was a student).

OTOH, I clearly remember that I *opened* that file with both of those software/machine to see the same molecule. FYI, OpenBabel 2.3.1 on the same machine generated with `$ obabel ATP.cdx -O ATP.svg` the following:. <img width=""400"" alt=""atpcdx-obmac231"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9957466/190418125-c90d4611-f09c-4720-b032-5f84ed08b204.png"">.

Deployability,"@arebruvold No, it is not twisted. However the configuration of the N=N double bond is not explicitly defined and a crossed double bond conventionally indicates you refer either i) to a mixture of (*E*) and (*Z*) difluorodiazene, or ii) you know there is the N=N double bond, but don't assign its configuration (perhaps by lack of information). For writing a .mol/.mol2/.sdf file with atomic coordinates the situation is even worse than for an illustration: imagine you construct a physical model of this molecule and now don't know where to put the fluorine atoms. In this particular case, you might better describe either the (*E*) configuration with `F\N=N\F`, or the (*Z*) isomer by `F\N=N/F`. Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen.

My guess is that whenever 4.0 comes out, the 100 projects (or whatever) will similarly need to make updates - and possibly significant ones. I don't have a problem with switching to `openbabel.pc` but frankly you, or any other package maintainer shouldn't just assume that projects will be compatible with another major version change by tinkering with the `pkg-config` or cmake files.

Deployability,"I started to convert your `.sdf` test files into `.pdb` by `obabel -isdf <ligand_name>.sdf -opdb -O <ligand_name>.pdb` with Open Babel (version 3.1.0 in Linux Debian, I suggest you check if you equally may update to this) and displayed them pairwise in an elder installation of Jmol (14.6.4_2016.11.05). Only the conversion about `PEMETREXED_1.sdb` yielded a reasonable display of the `.pdb` with different atom colors for C, H, N, O. You know that Open Babel may read and write `.sdf` and `.pdb` files. I knew there are multiple ways an `.xyz` or a `.pdb` file may be written and occasionally -- just for the sake of consistency -- I use Open Babel to «correct» these prior to further processing. Thanks to your test files, I learn that this apparently equally is the case for `.sdf` files and I thus issued conversions in pattern of `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1.sdf -osdf -O NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf` for both `NATEGLINIDE` and `PEMETREXED`, and then converted these by e.g., `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf -opdb NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.pdb`.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: You clearly have multiple versions of Python on your system. I don't know what version of Python you're using or what installed `openbabel`. I know that neither the source package, or `conda-forge` would install a _openbabel.cpython-38-darwin.so file, which is clearly from an old binary. I personally recommend using anaconda, which IIRC installs into a separate path, e.g. `/usr/local/anaconda/bin/python`. The `conda-forge` channel is updated within hours of a release:; `conda install -c conda-forge openbabel`. My suggestion for you would be to `rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/openbabel*` - that install is clearly linked to old Open Babel binaries.

For the background, see A. Spek's recent open access publication (author of Platon) [here](http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S2056989019016244).

Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen. Daylight compiled a set of references to learn more about (basic) SMILES' rules, see the [tutorial](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/index.html) and its links to theory and static examples. Because SMILES and subsequently SMARTS can be very helpful to search in databases, I recommend to complement your study with the two blog posts by Noel O'Boyle [SMARTS for dummies](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2018/11/smarts-for-dummies.html), its sequel [Smarts for Dummies Part II ](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2023/02/smarts-for-dummies-part-ii.html) and the interactive [test pad](https://baoilleach.github.io/smartersmarts-js/) (requires only a web browser, JavaScript enabled). Finally, Marvin by ChemAxon introduced [extended SMILES](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/formats_chemaxon-extended-smiles-and-smarts-cxsmiles-and-cxsmarts.md) as a format to retain additional information some programs equally can process, too (e.g. [Marvin JS](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/); [CDK depict](https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html), [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#cxsmiles-cxsmarts-extensions)). As an illustration, `F\N=N/F |lp:0:3,1:1,2:1,3:3|` describes above (*Z*) isomer.

I think you are asking; about unit tests though. I don't see how this code is testable without exposing some of the; depiction internals, or reimplementing them in the tests. Specifically; measuring the ""clash overlap"", which was an existing function in the; depiction code but is not exposed in the API. I'll look into it - it might; be as simple as setting a data field on the molecule. On 21 November 2013 22:23, Geoff Hutchison notifications@github.com wrote:. > Can we get some layout tests?

Content: All three geometries appear to differ slightly by comparison by a; Kabsch test, e.g. calculate_rmsd.py by Jimmy Charnley Kromann et; al.[1] Possible causes for only differences spot may be. + picking the wrong entry from the .nwo file (with multiple entries «geometry»); + indeed an unsuccessful optimization of the geometry submitted; + rounding errors within the implementation of the Kabsch test, or; + that the difference in geometry (especially as there are not this; many reference atoms in methane) by an optimization successfully; run is just little. However, C appears to move a little if; comparing in a diffview. On the other hand, the submission of NWChem's early test case of; nitrogen[2] which departs from; ```; title ""Nitrogen cc-pvdz SCF geometry optimization"" ; geometry ; n 0 0 0 ; n 0 0 1.08 ; end ; basis ; n library cc-pvdz ; end ; task scf optimize. ```; may be processed as mentioned earlier, i.e. after saving the above in; file `n2.nw` with; ```; nwchem n2.nw > n2.nwo; obabel -inwo n2.nwo -oxyz -O n2_out.xyz; ```; While this computation did not alter the interatomic distance (if; compared to the input), there is the move of the barycentre of the; molecule to (0,0,0) in the .xyz eventually written by OpenBabel:; ```; 2; n2.nwo; N 0.00000 0.00000 -0.54000; N 0.00000 0.00000 0.54000. ```; This observation contrasts with the hypothesis of an eventual report; of the input structure. (This is independent from the avenue to copy; and yank the tables from the .nwo into an .xyz file.).

Testability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.). Regarding the GUI of openbabel: you don't have to use it. Like every GUI, the developers selected some functionality which now is presented in a hierarchy assumed to be logical and useful. If there is only one, or a few of structures to interconvert into an other file format, the GUI *can* be useful.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.). Regarding the GUI of openbabel: you don't have to use it. Like every GUI, the developers selected some functionality which now is presented in a hierarchy assumed to be logical and useful. If there is only one, or a few of structures to interconvert into an other file format, the GUI *can* be useful. The access from the CLI however is *more suitable* (or, the only reasonable way) to interact with openbabel to *pipe* and *tee* input, output, error streams with a script, or programs (grep, sed, awk; an other instance of openbabel; something written by you, etc.).

It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Thank you so much for your nice explanation @nbehrnd. . Actually, I admit that I modified on purpose the SMILE to be sure that the aromatic flag was not well determined. Just to simplify, I have a list of molecules in MOL2 file that have been dearomatized with another software and openbabel didn't recognize the aromaticity by atoms (example attached, just change the extension). [test.txt](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/files/9055935/test.txt). Because of that, I want to know how to use ""AssignAromaticFlags"" function. . Nevertheless, you give me the idea to transform the molecule first to new smile and re-read it, like that it is working! However, not sure if the main problem with the MOL2 corresponds to the both ways to present the aromaticity (Kekule or lower-case) or it is a bug. `mol = next(pybel.readfile(""mol2"", ""./test.mol2""))`. `[int(atom.IsAromatic()) for atom in openbabel.OBMolAtomIter(mol.OBMol)]`. > [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. `mol.write(""can"")`. > `O=C(N[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@H](CNC1=CC=C(C=C1)N1CCCCC1)CCC1=CC=CC=C1)CC1=CC=CC=C1)OCC1=CC=CC=C1\tBDB50137400\n`. `mol = pybel.readstring(""can"", ""O=C(N[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@H]CNC1=CC=C(C=C1)N1CCCCC1)CCC1=CC=CC=C1)CC1=CC=CC=C1)OCC1=CC=CC=C1"")`. `mol.OBMol.AddHydrogens()`. > True. `[int(atom.IsAromatic()) for atom in openbabel.OBMolAtomIter(mol.OBMol)]`. > [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Testability,"Wow. Okay, digging into the code some more shows that the CML output *never* worked for Write(). The relevant code is the end of the code block:. ```; bool OBConversion::Write(OBBase* pOb, ostream* pos); {; if(pos) SetOutStream(pos, false);. if(!pOutFormat || !pOutput) return false;. SetOneObjectOnly(); //So that IsLast() returns true, which is important for XML formats; ```. The problem is that SetOneObjectOnly() sets m_IsLast to true, which means it cannot be used to write multiple objects (with a header/footer) correctly. The CML writer has:; ```; //If more than one molecule to be output, write <cml> at start and </cml> at end.; if(!_pxmlConv->IsLast()); {; xmlTextWriterStartElementNS(writer(), prefix, C_CML, uri);; uri=NULL;; }; ```; but that test for IsLast() returns m_IsLast which is true, so the !-inversion makes it false, so that branch is not taken. To make things worse, the footer can only be written if IsLast() is set, which must be done for the last molecule. This means Write() cannot be called until you know if it will be the last molecule to write, and manual users must specify that flag. That is, I see what you mean by ""second-class citizen."" The fundamental problem is that format API doesn't have header/footer generation as an independent task from writing a molecule, so there needs to be a way for the write to know if a molecule is the first or last molecule. It *appears* that the right solution is to:. - remove SetOneObjectOnly() from Write; - document the full Write API so people know when to SetLast(); - update pybel so it delays the last Write() until the close(), which is when it knows if the previous molecule really is the last molecule. A simple implementation of the last will either break code which expects that it's possible to modify outputfile.write(mol) after writing the molecule (which it can't because the outputfile hasn't yet written it), or require a copy.

The CML writer has:; ```; //If more than one molecule to be output, write <cml> at start and </cml> at end.; if(!_pxmlConv->IsLast()); {; xmlTextWriterStartElementNS(writer(), prefix, C_CML, uri);; uri=NULL;; }; ```; but that test for IsLast() returns m_IsLast which is true, so the !-inversion makes it false, so that branch is not taken. To make things worse, the footer can only be written if IsLast() is set, which must be done for the last molecule. This means Write() cannot be called until you know if it will be the last molecule to write, and manual users must specify that flag. That is, I see what you mean by ""second-class citizen."" The fundamental problem is that format API doesn't have header/footer generation as an independent task from writing a molecule, so there needs to be a way for the write to know if a molecule is the first or last molecule. It *appears* that the right solution is to:. - remove SetOneObjectOnly() from Write; - document the full Write API so people know when to SetLast(); - update pybel so it delays the last Write() until the close(), which is when it knows if the previous molecule really is the last molecule. A simple implementation of the last will either break code which expects that it's possible to modify outputfile.write(mol) after writing the molecule (which it can't because the outputfile hasn't yet written it), or require a copy. A more complex one might default to making a copy, with a flag to enable non-co

Looks like Babel's protonation function has the following limitations:; - a limited SMARTS ruleset, giving poor matching and accuracy; - code in phmodel.cpp only able to remove Hs, relying on input or 'addHydrogens' to provide a fully protonated structure. Is that a reasonable assessment of affairs?. Cheers,. Matt

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: It's a bug, but a documentation bug. The function does not do what it says it does.

Usability,"Let me explain (but not excuse) what's happening here. We have some code to short circuit InChI to InChIKey conversion. Basically on reading an InChI (and only an InChI), the InChI is stored as an attribute of the molecule. Any subsequent requests for the InChI just use this stored value rather than recalculating it. Without this short circuit, the conversion would be done by reading an InChI into an OBMol, converting the OBMol into an InChI and then subsequently into an InChIKey. The problem is that this might give a different result (as reading an InChI doesn't always sufficiently preserve the original structure). Modifying the molecule in-between clearly invalidates the InChI, but we don't have a mechanism internally to intercept modifications, so this is left to the user. If you ""print(inchi.data)"" you will see the offending data item. Deleting this (""del inchi.data['inchi']"") removes the cached value. In general I don't like automagic stuff like this, as it breaks code in complicated and unexpected ways. We could give up on accurate InChI->InChIKey conversion, or only cache the value if the user specifies an option.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Let me explain (but not excuse) what's happening here. We have some code to short circuit InChI to InChIKey conversion. Basically on reading an InChI (and only an InChI), the InChI is stored as an attribute of the molecule. Any subsequent requests for the InChI just use this stored value rather than recalculating it. Without this short circuit, the conversion would be done by reading an InChI into an OBMol, converting the OBMol into an InChI and then subsequently into an InChIKey. The problem is that this might give a different result (as reading an InChI doesn't always sufficiently preserve the original structure). Modifying the molecule in-between clearly invalidates the InChI, but we don't have a mechanism internally to intercept modifications, so this is left to the user. If you ""print(inchi.data)"" you will see the offending data item. Deleting this (""del inchi.data['inchi']"") removes the cached value. In general I don't like automagic stuff like this, as it breaks code in complicated and unexpected ways. We could give up on accurate InChI->InChIKey conversion, or only cache the value if the user specifies an option. On a separate note, can I ask why you are reading an InChI?

Usability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1557018; Originator: NO. This is for 3x3 fixed-size matrices. So there's nothing to gain from multithreading (the size is too small). It is very important to use fixed-size matrices in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations and unroll loops; most scientific libraries focus on dynamic-size matrices instead. Using dynamic-size matrices would divide the speed by a factor of 10 at least. OpenBabel's matrix code now has pretty extensive unit-tests so I don't think there's much to improve in the area of reliability. As to vectorization, it might indeed improve speed, I don't know (3x3 might be a too small size, and isn't a power of two, so it isn't clear to me that vectorization will help). Just FYI, someone offered to add vectorized codepaths to Eigen. Also keep in mind that currently OpenBabel gains much from the inlining of small math functions. This is only possible with either a builtin math lib (like OpenBabel currently has) or a template lib.

Content: Logged In: YES ; user_id=21420; Originator: NO. While I agree that consistency is a good aim, I'm going to move this to ""Feature Requests"" rather than an explicit bug. I believe the difference is simply that the two files came from different sources and Chris attempted to retain the formatting for merging in future revisions. Original comment by: @ghutchis

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Logged In: YES ; user_id=840863. Another (simplier) example:. [C@@]%10(F)(C)C(=O)O.Br%10 is converted to; F[C@@](Br)(C)C(=O)O which is wrong. Correct would be e.g.; Br[C@@](F)(C)C(=O)O. --Andreas. Original comment by: archvile18

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Output your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""

Usability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: NO. I cannot reproduce the bug either on Windows or on Linux with the current snapshot (b7). I think that this issue is resolved since r1958 (soon after the initial bug report). Previously I created a new instance of OBConversion for each readfile; after this, I used the same global instance. Note that I have not looked at the gz stuff, I am simply talking about regular files, for which Ahmet said he had the same problem. I am making this bug as Closed, but I should probably stress test the Pybel I/O code at some point in the future.

Usability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. This is my first time debugging in C++, but I think I've found the immediate problem. I'm working off the 2-1-x branch on WinXP. The PDB file was download from the PDB and is attached to the original bug report. If I just read in the PDB file with the following code, I get an error:; int main(int argc,char *argv[]); {; OBConversion conv;; 	OBMol mol;; 	conv.SetInFormat(""pdb"");; 	conv.ReadFile(&mol, ""1ABE.pdb"");; 	; 	cout << ""hey:"" << mol.NumAtoms() << endl;; 	system(""pause"");; }. The line of the file that causes the problem is:; HETATM 2338 O HOH 309 9.470 57.177 56.123 0.98 12.11 1ABE2423.

Content: Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. This is my first time debugging in C++, but I think I've found the immediate problem. I'm working off the 2-1-x branch on WinXP.

Done. It's `pybel.ipython_3d`, and it defaults to False. I think 2D is more useful than 3D in common use cases. ![screenshot from 2013-12-09 09 09 34](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1449833/1706053/d2ebffa4-60e8-11e3-9526-be9603b1cc19.png)

Usability,"Thanks for looking into this Tim. My own feeling is that there are two separate issues here:. 1. Can an atom with a hydrogen and a lone pair be stereogenic? This is related to stereocenter perception. Let me ping @johnmay on this. I'm pretty sure there are cases of this related to S (maybe not N), but I think John can clear this up.; 2. Should RemoveHydrogens() suppress hydrogens involved in cis/trans stereo? I think the answer to this is no. One of the invariants of the toolkit should be that suppressing and expanding hydrogens should not change any information. Note that (1) and (2) are separate issues. I've changed the SMILES reader so that stereo perception is optional (""-aS""). By default, stereo is just read directly from the SMILES (same behaviour as OEChem and CDK, at least).

Do you know how other software handles these H's?. For my original purpose, a better query would be something like [Nv2H1], which is unambiguous (obviously once the other bug has been fixed). Coming from a background where our compounds are (nearly) always stored as SMILES, I'd probably been using the Dn descriptor a little lazily. If you can (almost) guarantee no explicit H's, it's phenomenally useful for generating simple queries for e.g. primary amines, pyridones etc. that are independent of tautomeric / protomeric state.

Usability,"To be honest I kind of agree with you on the whole Dn thing - using queries that rely on explicit vs implicit H's does just sound like a bad idea. Perhaps I shouldn't have waxed quite so lyrical in my previous response. I have been caught out a couple of times even in a SMILES + Daylight environment - deuterated compounds being one example.... To answer your question, if you do make the assumption that all H's are implicit, then a query for a primary amine is as simple as [ND1][CX4], and you can capture both pyridone tautomers with [nD2]c~[OD1]. ""Dn"" becomes a synonym for ""is bonded to n heavy atoms"", which can come in very handy. But to reiterate, on reflection I think this is slightly sloppy querying on my part, and I certainly wouldn't suggest changing the way OB works just so that these queries work as expected. (Though I'd be interested to know how many other people use similar kinds of queries). I do think it would be worth finding out what some of the other major software vendors do with the H descriptor in a SMILES string though, even if this is just a matter of internal representation. To put it another way, if everybody else does it the same way Daylight does, is there a good reason OB is different?. Anyway, thanks for making me think this through a bit more rigorously!.

Sorry, I feared that the one who programmed all the; complicated details of kekulize.cpp might take it as an; insult to be told about the location of double bonds in the; standard DNA base-pairs ;-). Anyway, here we go, looking at the attached kekubug.pdb:. Residue 630 is Guanosine. OpenBabel puts a double bond at; C2=N2, but it should instead be flipped over to C2=N3:; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_monophosphate. There is this general rule that oxygens bound to aromatic; rings get a double bond if possible (i.e. if it doesn't kill; aromaticity), because the keto form is more stable than the; enol tautomer:; http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Keto_enol-tautomerism; (that's already handled well by OpenBabel). I think OpenBabel still needs to consider that nitrogens; bound to aromatic rings get a single bond if possible.; Couldn't find the theoretical justification for this; empirical rule, can anyone help?. Residue 631 is Cytidine, with essentially the same problem; again: The C4=N4 double bond belongs to C4=N3.; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytidine. Residue 632 is an unusual one where OpenBabel puts a double; bond at C1*=C5, which is impossible because C1* is clearly; sp3 hybridized and non-planar.; So both the C1*=C5 and N1=C6 double bonds should be single; bonds, with a C6=C5 double bond in the middle. BTW: I don't have an example now, but I saw the kekulizer; generate different results for the same residue type, i.e.; in PDB file 1ASZ every residue type appears multiple times,; but didn't always get the same single/double bond pattern.

Sorry, I feared that the one who programmed all the; complicated details of kekulize.cpp might take it as an; insult to be told about the location of double bonds in the; standard DNA base-pairs ;-). Anyway, here we go, looking at the attached kekubug.pdb:. Residue 630 is Guanosine. OpenBabel puts a double bond at; C2=N2, but it should instead be flipped over to C2=N3:; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_monophosphate. There is this general rule that oxygens bound to aromatic; rings get a double bond if possible (i.e. if it doesn't kill; aromaticity), because the keto form is more stable than the; enol tautomer:; http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Keto_enol-tautomerism; (that's already handled well by OpenBabel). I think OpenBabel still needs to consider that nitrogens; bound to aromatic rings get a single bond if possible.; Couldn't find the theoretical justification for this; empirical rule, can anyone help?. Residue 631 is Cytidine, with essentially the same problem; again: The C4=N4 double bond belongs to C4=N3.; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytidine. Residue 632 is an unusual one where OpenBabel puts a double; bond at C1*=C5, which is impossible because C1* is clearly; sp3 hybridized and non-planar.; So both the C1*=C5 and N1=C6 double bonds should be single; bonds, with a C6=C5 double bond in the middle. BTW: I don't have an example now, but I saw the kekulizer; generate different results for the same residue type, i.e.; in PDB file 1ASZ every residue type appears multiple times,; but didn't always get the same single/double bond pattern.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: th the assignment of InChI (like a structure2InChI) as well as for the reversed approach InChI2structure. If it is for. > « Different input structures may give the same result; for example, acetic acid and acetate would both give the same core parent structure, that of acetic acid.»; >; > [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemical_Identifier). then a test, e.g., with the [ChemDraw JS page](https://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/sample/index.html#) reveals (contemporary) implementations of the assignment are going to assign the two *differently* by a layer describing charges only seen for the later. Thus,. ```; InChI HOAc: InChI=1S/C2H4O2/c1-2(3)4/h1H3,(H,3,4); InChI OAc-: InChI=1S/C2H4O2/c1-2(3)4/h1H3,(H,3,4)/p-1; ```; Referring to the `inchi-1` reference 64bit executable published by the InChI trust, it is possible to convert (lists of) InChI strings into an intermediate form (toggle `InChI2Struct`) and eventually into a `.sdf` (toggle `OutputSDF`). I agree InChI's regenerated `.sdf` (currently) have an extra line too many, and it seems a bit odd to that these put all atoms into one spot of coordinate (0,0,0). Yet OpenBabel's output is the same in this regard (and already did so converting SMILES strings into `.sdf`) *except if requested* to consider an additional `--gen2d` (or, `--gen3d`). In case InChI are systematically less good than, say (for example) the SMILES notation, then I would suggest to extend the documentation accordingly (e.g., section 18.1.3). The user guide shipped with v. 1.06 for example states. > «Standard InChI organometallic representation does not include bonds to metal for the time being.»; >; > InChI_UserGuide.pdf, page 2. which may fit as a constraint to consider. Do you know about other groups of chemical compounds where OpenBabel's InChI2structure approach may lead to unforeseen, unintended results? If you think it would be worth to discuss this in a separate issue in further detail, I would move this comment.
