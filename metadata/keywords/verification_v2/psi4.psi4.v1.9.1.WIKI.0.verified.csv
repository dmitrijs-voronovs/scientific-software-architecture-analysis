Cacheing level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantites with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2. CACHETYPE¶. The criterion used to retain/release cached data. Type: string; Possible Values: LOW, LRU; Default: LRU. CC3_FOLLOW_ROOT¶. Do turn on root following for CC3. Type: boolean; Default: false. CC_NUM_THREADS¶. Number of threads. Type: integer; Default: 1. COLLAPSE_WITH_LAST¶. Do collapse with last vector?. Type: boolean; Default: true. COMPLEX_TOLERANCE¶. Complex tolerance applied in CCEOM computations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-12. EOM_GUESS¶. Specifies a set of single-excitation guess vectors for the EOM-CC procedure. If EOM_GUESS = SINGLES, the guess will be taken from the singles-singles block of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, Hbar. If EOM_GUESS = DISK, guess vectors from a previous computation will be read from disk. If EOM_GUESS = INPUT, guess vectors will be specified in user input. The latter method is not currently available. Type: string; Possible Values: SINGLES, DISK, INPUT; Default: SINGLES. EOM_REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type for EOM computations.

The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it.; See psi4/codedeps.yaml for a structured listing and history of dependencies. C++ and C Compilers (C++20 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.8+) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.15+) https://cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) https://numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make and GNU install or Ninja, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library. The following are also required for PSI4, but if not detected, the; build system will automatically download and build. gau2grid — [what is gau2grid?] [gau2grid min version]; Libint — [what is Libint?] [Libint min version] (Libint2 as of Nov 2020; added by v1.4). Eigen https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page; Boost https://www.boost.org/ header-only preprocessor library. Libxc — [what is Libxc?] [Libxc min version]; pybind11 — [what is Pybind11?] [Pybind11 min version]; QCElemental — [what is QCElemental?]; QCEngine — [what is QCEngine?] (March 2019; added by v1.4); optking — [what is optking] (runtime dependency, required at build-time). Additionally, there are runtime-only dependencies:. msgpack-python for MessagePack https://msgpack.org/ (transitive dependency of QCElemental; optional for QCElemental but required for PSI4); NumPy https://numpy.

Herbst; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables. PSI4 contains code to interface to the ddx FORTRAN library developed; by A. Mikhalev et. al.. The library provides a linear-scaling implementation; of standard continuum solvation models using a domain-decomposition ansatz; [Cances:2013:054111] [Stamm:2016:054101].; Currently the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) [Klamt:1993:799] [Lipparini:2014:184108]; and the polarisable continuum model (PCM) [Tomasi:2005:2999] [Nottoli:2019:6061]; are supported.; No additional licence or configuration is required to use ddx with Psi4.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content:  Type: conv double; Default: 1e-8. CCD_MAXITER (SAPT)¶SAPT — Max CCD iterations. Type: integer; Default: 50. CCD_T_CONVERGENCE (SAPT)¶SAPT — Convergence tolerance for CCD amplitudes. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-8. CCL_ENERGY (OCC)¶OCC — Do compute CC Lambda energy? In order to this option to be valid one should use “TPDM_ABCD_TYPE = COMPUTE” option. Type: boolean; Default: false. CEPA_LEVEL (FNOCC)¶FNOCC (Expert) — Which coupled-pair method is called? This parameter is used internally by the python driver. Changing its value won’t have any effect on the procedure. Type: string; Default: CEPA(0). CEPA_NO_SINGLES (FNOCC)¶FNOCC — Flag to exclude singly excited configurations from a coupled-pair computation. Type: boolean; Default: false. CEPA_OS_SCALE (OCC)¶OCC — Removed in 1.4. Will raise an error in 1.5. Type: double; Default: 1.27. CEPA_SOS_SCALE (OCC)¶OCC — Removed in 1.4. Will raise an error in 1.5. Type: double; Default: 1.3. CEPA_SS_SCALE (OCC)¶OCC — Removed in 1.4. Will raise an error in 1.5. Type: double; Default: 1.13. CEPA_TYPE (OCC)¶OCC — CEPA type such as CEPA0, CEPA1 etc. currently we have only CEPA0. Type: string; Possible Values: CEPA0; Default: CEPA0. CFOUR_ABCDTYPE (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies the way the \(\langle ab||cd \rangle\) molecular orbital integrals are handled in post-MP2 calculations. STANDARD (= 0) uses directly the corresponding MO integrals and thus results in an algorithm which in particular for large-scale calculations results in excessive use of disk space (storage of all \(\langle ab||cd\rangle\) integrals. AOBASIS (=2) uses an AO-based algorithm to evaluate all terms involving the \(\langle ab||cd\rangle\) integrals and significantly reduces the amount of disk storage. The use of ABCDTYPE=AOBASIS is strongly recommended for all CC calculations up to CCSD(T) and has been implemented for energy, gradient, second-derivative, and excitation energy calculations. Type: string; Possible Values: STANDARD, AOBASIS; Default: STANDARD. CFOUR_

If using PSI4 built from source and you want to build gCP from; from source also, follow the instructions provided with the source; (essentially, download the freely available tarball, unpack the source,; edit the Makefile to select a Fortran compiler, and run make). To be used by PSI4, the program binary (gcp) must be; found in your PSIPATH or PATH (in that order). If; PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error will be reported.; To preferentially use a particular gcp compilation, simply adjust its; position in the path environment variables. Running gCP¶; At present there is a limited interface to gCP that is used; only to implement the “HF-3c” [Sure:2013:1672] and “PBEh-3c”; [Grimme:2015:054107] methods (both energy and gradient). The DFTD3 executable must also be available for these methods to; run. Unlike every other method in PSI4, if a basis set has not been; set, these will default to their intended basis sets: MINIX for HF-3c; and def2-mSVP for PBEh-3c. If a basis has previously been set, but you; want to use the default basis, use the slash syntax to “empty” the basis; option for the scope of the current calculation, energy(""hf3c/"").; A few practical examples:.

To remove a conda installation, conda remove gcp. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want to build gCP from; from source also, follow the instructions provided with the source; (essentially, download the freely available tarball, unpack the source,; edit the Makefile to select a Fortran compiler, and run make). To be used by PSI4, the program binary (gcp) must be; found in your PSIPATH or PATH (in that order). If; PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error will be reported.; To preferentially use a particular gcp compilation, simply adjust its; position in the path environment variables. Running gCP¶; At present there is a limited interface to gCP that is used; only to implement the “HF-3c” [Sure:2013:1672] and “PBEh-3c”; [Grimme:2015:054107] methods (both energy and gradient). The DFTD3 executable must also be available for these methods to; run. Unlike every other method in PSI4, if a basis set has not been; set, these will default to their intended basis sets: MINIX for HF-3c; and def2-mSVP for PBEh-3c. If a basis has previously been set, but you; want to use the default basis, use the slash syntax to “empty” the basis; option for the scope of the current calculation, energy(""hf3c/"").; A few practical examples:.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content:  appear in; the input file, so if the last four commands in the above example were to read; set basis cc-pVDZ; energy('ccsd'); set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1. the commands that set the print level would be ineffective, as they would be; processed after the CCSD computation completes.; In PsiAPI mode, one can use the command set_options(); like below for general and module-specific options. Note that these values; should be of correct type, strings for strings, floats for floats like; convergences. The function ~psi4.core.clean_options that reinitializes; all options may also be useful to separate calculations in a PsiAPI; session.; psi4.set_options({; 'scf_type': 'pk',; 'e_convergence': 1.e-5,; 'soscf': True,; 'optking__geom_maxiter': 50; }). Basis Sets¶. Basis Sets; Built-In Basis Sets; Mixing Basis Sets; Decontracted Basis Sets; User-Defined Basis Sets; Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs). PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the sp

Availability," default it is worked out from the number of basis sets (1 - 3) supplied as `basis`.; `alpha`: alpha for the above scheme, if the default is to be overriden; `options`: if special options are required for a step, they should be entered as a dict here. If some options should be used for both parts of the stage, they should be entered in both `options` and `options_lo`. This is helpful for calculating all electron corrections in otherwise frozen core calculations, or relativistic (DKH) Hamiltionian corrections for otherwise nonrelativistic.; `options_lo`: special options for lower method in a given stage. This is useful to calculate a direct stage in an otherwise density-fitted calculation, or similar.; `treatment`: treat extrapolation stage as `scf` or `corl`, by default only the first stage is `scf` and every later one is `corl`.; `stage`: tag for the stage used in tables. The next items in the `cbs_metadata` array extrapolate correlation. All of the above parameters are available, with only the `wfn` and `basis` keywords required. Other supported parameters are:. `wfn_lo`: the lower method from which the delta correction is to be calculated.

Note that while the total number of macroiterations will be; less for SOSCF than gradient-based convergence acceleration, the cost of solving; the microiterations typically results in the overall cost being greater for; SOSCF than for gradient-based methods. Therefore, SOSCF should only be used if; it is difficult to locate a stable minimum.; SOSCF is only available for RHF, ROHF, and UHF reference (and only for HF, not DFT).; To turn on, simply set; the option SOSCF to true. Additional options to modify the number of; microiterations taken are as follows:. SOSCF_START_CONVERGENCE: when to start SOSCF based on the current density RMS; SOSCF_MAX_ITER: the maximum number of SOSCF microiterations per macroiteration; SOSCF_CONV: the relative convergence tolerance of the SOSCF microiterations; SOSCF_PRINT: option to print the microiterations or not. Stability Analysis¶; SCF algorithms attempt to minimize the gradient of the energy with respect; to orbital variation parameters. At convergence, the gradient should be approximately zero; given a convergence criterion. Although this is enough to make sure the SCF converged to a; stationary point, this is not a sufficient condition for a minimal SCF solution. It may be; a saddle point or a maximum.; To ensure that a minimum has been found, the electronic Hessian, i.e. the matrix of second; derivatives of the energy with res

Note; Certain convergence and tolerance keywords, of type double (real numbers),; may be specified using either a real number or an integer; and integer X is then; treated as the number of converged decimal digits required.

Availability," in the appropriate point group. The same syntax can be; used to specify basis sets other than that used to define orbitals. For; example,; set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri. or. basis {; assign cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2; computations. To assign the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI to carbon atoms, the following; command is used:; basis {; assign C aug-cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and; Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate; auxiliary basis set automatically according to Auxiliary Basis Sets,; unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the; input. Finally, we note that the basis {...} block may also be used; for defining basis sets, as detailed in Sec. User-Defined Basis Sets. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 Gb. memory 2000 Mb. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 Gb.; set_memory(2000000000).

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content:  indicates that this is the first orbital that belongs to the B1 irrep.; The file Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube begins with two comment lines:; 1; 2Psi4 Gaussian Cube File.; Property: Psi_a_5_1-B1. Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495). The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks.

Availability," method described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663], is available in Psi4 in conjunction with composite algorithms that build J (SCF_TYPE set to J_alg+LINK).; LinK achieves linear-scaling by exploiting shell pair sparsity in the density matrix and overlap sparsity between shell pairs. Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especially powerful when combined with density-matrix based ERI screening (set SCREENING to DENSITY) and incremental Fock builds (set INCFOCK to TRUE), which decrease the number of significant two-electron integrals to calculate.; To control the LinK algorithm, here are the list of options provided. LINK_INTS_TOLERANCE: The integral screening tolerance used for sparsity-prep in the LinK algorithm. Defaults to the INTS_TOLERANCE option.

Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especially powerful when combined with density-matrix based ERI screening (set SCREENING to DENSITY) and incremental Fock builds (set INCFOCK to TRUE), which decrease the number of significant two-electron integrals to calculate.; To control the LinK algorithm, here are the list of options provided.
