Apoptosis has been shown to be induced by serum deprivation or copper treatment. To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon. These results indicated that nonylphenol diethoxylate has capability to affect cell differentiation and development and has potentially harmful effect on organisms because of its unexpected impact on apoptosis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",recover,MatchSource.DOCS,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/tree/v0.5.5/tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt:5631,recovered,5631,tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/tree/v0.5.5/tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt,1,['recover'],['recovered'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

The scispacy pip package is published automatically using the `.github/actions/publish.yml` github action. It happens whenever a release is published (with an associated tag) in the github releases UI. In order to create a new release, the following should happen:. #### Updating `scispacy/version.py`; Update the version in version.py. #### Training new models. The entire pipeline can be run using `spacy project run all`. This will train and package all the models. The packages should then be uploaded to the `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/{VERSION}` S3 bucket, and references to previous models (e.g in the readme and in the docs) should be updated. You can find all these places using `git grep <previous version>`. The scripts `install_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, `print_out_metrics.py`, `smoke_test.py`, and `uninstall_local_packages.py` are useful for testing at each step of the process. Before uploading, `install_local_packages.py` and `smoke_test.py` can be used to make sure the packages are installable and do a quick check of output. `print_out_metrics.py` can then be used to easily get the metrics that need to be updated in the README. Once the packages have been uploaded, `uninstall_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, and `smoke_test.py` can be used to ensure everything was uploaded correctly. #### Merge a PR with the above changes; Merge a PR with the above changes, and publish a release with a tag corresponding to the commit from the merged PR.

Content: ><img width=""50%"" src=""docs/scispacy-logo.png"" /></p>. This repository contains custom pipes and models related to using spaCy for scientific documents. In particular, there is a custom tokenizer that adds tokenization rules on top of spaCy's; rule-based tokenizer, a POS tagger and syntactic parser trained on biomedical data and; an entity span detection model. Separately, there are also NER models for more specific tasks. **Just looking to test out the models on your data? Check out our [demo](https://scispacy.apps.allenai.org)** (Note: this demo is running an older version of scispaCy and may produce different results than the latest version). ## Installation; Installing scispacy requires two steps: installing the library and intalling the models. To install the library, run:; ```bash; pip install scispacy; ```. to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:. ```bash; pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.4/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.4.tar.gz; ```.

You can access the list of abbreviations via the `doc._.abbreviations` attribute and for a given abbreviation,; you can access it's long form (which is a `spacy.tokens.Span`) using `span._.long_form`, which will point to; another span in the document. #### Example Usage; ```python; import spacy. from scispacy.abbreviation import AbbreviationDetector. nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""). # Add the abbreviation pipe to the spacy pipeline.; nlp.add_pipe(""abbreviation_detector""). doc = nlp(""Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \; inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \; of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \; SBMA can be caused by this easily.""). print(""Abbreviation"", ""\t"", ""Definition""); for abrv in doc._.abbreviations:; 	print(f""{abrv} \t ({abrv.start}, {abrv.end}) {abrv._.long_form}""). >>> Abbreviation	 Span	 Definition; >>> SBMA 		 (33, 34) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> SBMA 	 	 (6, 7) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> AR 		 (29, 30) androgen receptor; ```. > **Note**; > If you want to be able to [serialize your `doc` objects](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading), load the abbreviation detector with `make_serializable=True`, e.g. `nlp.add_pipe(""abbreviation_detector"", config={""make_serializable"": True})`. ### EntityLinker.

By using exome sequencing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06). Our observations reinforce that DCTN4 missense variants, especially p.Tyr263Cys, may be involved in the pathogenesis of CPA in male CF.; 25763772	0	5	DCTN4	T103	UMLS:C4308010; 25763772	23	63	chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection	T038	UMLS:C0854135; 25763772	67	82	cystic fibrosis	T038	UMLS:C0010674; 2",reduce,MatchSource.DOCS,allenai,scispacy,v0.5.5,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/tree/v0.5.5/tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt:302,reduced,302,tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt,https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/,https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/tree/v0.5.5/tests/fixtures/med_mentions.txt,1,['reduce'],['reduced'],"The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06). Our observations reinforce that DCTN4 missense variants, especially p.Tyr263Cys, may be involved in the pathogenesis of CPA in male CF.; 25763772	0	5	DCTN4	T103	UMLS:C4308010; 25763772	23	63	chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection	T038	UMLS:C0854135; 25763772	67	82	cystic fibrosis	T038	UMLS:C0010674; 2

To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon.

Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm.

In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm.

[Follow the installation instructions for Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). 2. Create a Conda environment called ""scispacy"" with Python 3.9 (any version >= 3.6 should work):. ```bash; mamba create -n scispacy python=3.10; ```. 3. Activate the Mamba environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy. ```bash; mamba activate scispacy; ```. Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above. Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:; ```python; import spacy; nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""); doc = nlp(""Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.""); ```. #### Note on upgrading; If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have. ## Available Models.

For example:; ```python; import spacy; nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""); doc = nlp(""Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.""); ```. #### Note on upgrading; If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have. ## Available Models. To install a model, click on the link below to download the model, and then run . ```python; pip install </path/to/download>; ```. Alternatively, you can install directly from the URL by right-clicking on the link, selecting ""Copy Link Address"" and running ; ```python; pip install CMD-V(to paste the copied URL); ```. | Model | Description | Install URL; |:---------------|:------------------|:----------|; | en_core_sci_sm | A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~100k vocabulary. |[Download](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.4/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.4.tar.gz)|; | en_core_

The `EntityLinker` is a SpaCy component which performs linking to a knowledge base. The linker simply performs; a string overlap - based search (char-3grams) on named entities, comparing them with the concepts in a knowledge base; using an approximate nearest neighbours search. Currently (v2.5.0), there are 5 supported linkers:. - `umls`: Links to the [Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html), levels 0,1,2 and 9. This has ~3M concepts.; - `mesh`: Links to the [Medical Subject Headings](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html). This contains a smaller set of higher quality entities, which are used for indexing in Pubmed. MeSH contains ~30k entities. NOTE: The MeSH KB is derived directly from MeSH itself, and as such uses different unique identifiers than the other KBs.; - `rxnorm`: Links to the [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html) ontology. RxNorm contains ~100k concepts focused on normalized names for clinical drugs. It is comprised of several other drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction, including First Databank, Micromedex, and the Gold Standard Drug D

The scispacy pip package is published automatically using the `.github/actions/publish.yml` github action. It happens whenever a release is published (with an associated tag) in the github releases UI. In order to create a new release, the following should happen:. #### Updating `scispacy/version.py`; Update the version in version.py. #### Training new models. The entire pipeline can be run using `spacy project run all`. This will train and package all the models. The packages should then be uploaded to the `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/{VERSION}` S3 bucket, and references to previous models (e.g in the readme and in the docs) should be updated. You can find all these places using `git grep <previous version>`. The scripts `install_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, `print_out_metrics.py`, `smoke_test.py`, and `uninstall_local_packages.py` are useful for testing at each step of the process. Before uploading, `install_local_packages.py` and `smoke_test.py` can be used to make sure the packages are installable and do a quick check of output. `print_out_metrics.py` can then be used to easily get the metrics that need to be updated in the README. Once the packages have been uploaded, `uninstall_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, and `smoke_test.py` can be used to ensure everything was uploaded correctly. #### Merge a PR with the above changes; Merge a PR with the above changes, and publish a release with a tag corresponding to the commit from the merged PR.
