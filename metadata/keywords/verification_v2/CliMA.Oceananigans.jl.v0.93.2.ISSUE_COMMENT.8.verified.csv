Usability,"**Can we use advection for mass evolution equation?**. Let me try and convince you that using advection for continuity makes sense. If I don't succeed then clearly I need to put more thought into it. The governing equation can be written in two forms; $$; \partial_t = -\partial_x (h u) - \partial_y (h v) = - \partial_x U - \partial_y V ; $$; If we were to solve this in terms of the velocities (u,v), then using advection is clearly a good idea as we are advecting h by the velocity. In the case of upwinding, we pick the direction based on the sign of u (or v). We are using the transports instead of velocities but it is very similar to the advection of a tracer $\nabla \cdot (u c)$ except that we use c = 1. Given that the physics is the same in both cases, I think we should be using the advection scheme for this term. . The evolution equations for h and c have a lot in common, which is helpful here. The one major difference is that h is an active tracer in the sense that it feeds back on the momentum. Even though that's the case, I don't think this should affect how we discretize the advection of h, even though it is disguesed with our use of the transport variable. If you agree with my reasoning I don't think we need to do anything different for the evolution of height equation, we might just need to have some new functions that account for this, which are essentially equivalent to c = 0. Maybe what you suggest is the way to proceed?. **High Order Finite Volume**. I agree that keeping things finite volume is a good idea, and that is how I would like to proceed. Good to know that IncompressibleModel won't generalize to higher order. I agree that the 4th-order pieces are there and just need to be assembled. The paper you cited above is very helpful but needs to be modified slightly as they present the method for a non-staggered grid, but ours is staggered.

Usability,"**Final Commit Details**. Remove 4/3 factor, && --> &, ζ=NaN where undefined. 1. Remove 4/3 Factor in Vorticity Computation: The 4/3 factor was initially introduced in the vorticity calculation at the corners because the area used to divide the circulation (in the denominator) was reduced to three-quarters of its original value. However, it turns out that by adopting the Haversine formula for calculating the quadrilateral area on a sphere---which simplifies to a triangle when two points coincide---the 4/3 factor is inherently accounted for. Therefore, the explicit inclusion of this factor is no longer necessary. 2. Replace Short-Circuiting && with Logical &: Changed the short-circuiting && operator to the logical & operator to ensure compatibility with GPU operations. 3. Set Circulation Γ and Vorticity ζ to NaN when Undefined: Updated the code to assign NaN (Not a Number) to circulation Γ and vorticity ζ in cases where they are undefined. @glwagner, @navidcy, could one of you please review this PR once the tests pass, so I can proceed with merging?

Usability,". But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: . But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think. This leads to a fairly simple criteria for the time step that's compatible with the pressure correction. But as noted in this PR, this is not enough to fix issues with the immersed boundary MWE... but whether or not that is because of problems with the setup itself, I'm not sure... - All of that said, taking @tomchor suggestion to be more careful in updating the clock for RK3 actually does solve the MWE here.

Usability,"> (this is how PISCES implements a lot of the growth to prevent repetitive calculation of the same values, I don't know if this would be faster in this setting without testing but just as an example). I agree that we need this feature, but from a software design perspective one might argue that such an invasive change to model dynamics belongs in the source code itself, rather than a callback (and this of course how it works for PISCES, or any model other than Oceananigans --- since Oceananigans is the only model where we can envision such a fine-grained callback schema). I think having a callback infrastructure like this effectively allows people who implement advanced / custom applications to keep their code up to date with other changes to Oceananigans. The alternative model for software design, which is simply to create a new version of the source code for your custom application, leads to much more code duplication.

Usability,"> 1. Should we change the flux convention in Oceananigans so that `FluxBoundaryCondition` specifies the flux along the _inward pointing normal_? This reverses the convention we use on ""right"" boundaries (west, north, top). For example, a negative buoyancy flux would cause cooling at the surface with this convention. This is a huge change, but I think is necessary to do things like specifying a drag boundary condition on vertical velocity (I can discuss further why this is the case if needed.). I quite like the current convention for specifying fluxes since (imho) it's more mathematically intuitive, so my vote goes to maintaining that convention if we can (although I agree that it makes it harder to apply it generally for immersed solids...). One way to do it would be to leave most of the heavy work for the user, which would have to specify fluxes in each of the immersed solid's interfaces separately. The user's script would look like what I did here:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/faed0c4ac85409cb94811b0bdba2bbb7becf330a/sandbox/drag_test.jl#L25-L41. The downside is that this won't work for non-grid-fitted boundaries and requires more user-written code. The upside is that could (I think) re-use much of the inner-workings of the current BC implementation. > We can do 2. without 1. In that case we'll be able to support a lot of common cases, including ordinary oceanic cases (where boundaries do not overhang, and we only specify drag on tangential components). It's really LES cases that become tricky because we can't specify drag on vertical velocity components, or on tangential components when the boundary overhangs. Not sure I understand this point.

Usability,"> > > Thanks for clarifying @glwagner .; > > > I guess I need to learn how this is done in the other models.; > > ; > > ; > > But for one layer, WENO vector invariant plus WENO for mass flux may be sufficient, and we don't need any other dissipation (which is nice, less work for us).; > ; > I agree. If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model. My opinion is that with these nice WENO5 numerics there",learn,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226:65,learn,65,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226,1,['learn'],['learn'],"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model. My opinion is that with these nice WENO5 numerics there

Since I haven't heard great things about it (and it doesn't actually address the primary issues associated with strong stratification and LES closures) I'd rather spend my time working on other LES closures. So I'm in favor of nuking... But a warning / disclaimer is also a good solution. I'm up for both (this PR is as good a one as any to do this...)

Content: > > Does the total energy do the same thing or is it just the momentum?; > ; > I'll add that to `flow_over_hills.jl`!. Thanks. . Given the fact that the reference case flows over a flat bottom it doesn't suprise me that the mometum decreases monotonically. . The 2nd and 3rd case are flowing over topography and there should be a periodic effect of the topography on the momentum. No? Total momentum must vary because of the forcing and I don't know exactly what that should look like. But if the energy is not monotonic that would be a clear sign that something is going wrong.

Usability,"> > I think having a default but non-trivial CFL would be surprising and therefore undesirable, even if it's convenient for some users.; > > I was hoping we might be able to deprecate `diffusive_cfl` because it's a big maintenance burden, but let's keep it if its useful.; > ; > I wouldn't setting the `diffusive_cfl` is surprising. After all the diffusive cfl is as much of a necessary condition for convergence as the advective cfl, it just is a limiting-factor less often for oceanic simulations. But I'm okay with keeping the current behavior as well. I certainly don't disagree that it's convenient; the question is more whether the benefit justifies the cost. Users also want a code that's easy to maintain and extend because then they get more features! For constant diffusivities, the CFL constraint can be pre-calculated. For some common closures the calculation is simple, but this is not _generically_ the case for all turbulence closures.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: > > I think having a default but non-trivial CFL would be surprising and therefore undesirable, even if it's convenient for some users.; > > I was hoping we might be able to deprecate `diffusive_cfl` because it's a big maintenance burden, but let's keep it if its useful.; > ; > I wouldn't setting the `diffusive_cfl` is surprising. After all the diffusive cfl is as much of a necessary condition for convergence as the advective cfl, it just is a limiting-factor less often for oceanic simulations. But I'm okay with keeping the current behavior as well. I certainly don't disagree that it's convenient; the question is more whether the benefit justifies the cost. Users also want a code that's easy to maintain and extend because then they get more features! For constant diffusivities, the CFL constraint can be pre-calculated. For some common closures the calculation is simple, but this is not _generically_ the case for all turbulence closures. It's really only for variable diffusivities that we _need_ a feature for on-the-fly calculation. We could also use something like `diffusive_cfl=nothing` which completely avoids the calculation. Then we can justify supporting a diffusive CFL calculation for selected turbulence closures. That might be a good route (discussion for another issue).

It is kind of annoying but you have to set a ""minimum height"" in the initial conditions (cannot start with `h = 0` somewhere). I remember setting `hmin = 10` was enough to get a stable simulation. Thanks @simone-silvestri. . The validation script was set up with `hmin = 10` and that did go unstable. I tried `20` and `30` and they both go unstable. I'm tring `40` and it seems better. I thought if this at least runs, and shows us the ACC going on the right direction, thsi would be a big leap forward. Then we can worry abou thow to minimize the minimum h, if we like. . I will keep you posted. Update: 50 is still unstable after just under 3 hours. I'm now going to try 100. It seems like a pretty big cushion but I am curious what it takes. . And 100 yields negative height after less than 4 hours. Not good.

This PR is exploratory and is a fallback that might not be merged if we find an efficient way to do GPU transposes with PencilArrays (requires reducing memory allocations and improving the efficiency of permute operations) and implement r2r Fourier transforms in PencilFFTs. For the moment those two elements are part of this PR.; > ; > This PR follows the (simple) configuration of the 2decomp library https://github.com/2decomp-fft/2decomp-fft, the difference between PencilFFT/PencilArray and this PR (a part bounded domain ffts) is that here (at the moment) we impose the stricter limitation that `Ny` has to be divisible by `Rx` and `Ry` while `Nz` has to be divisible by `Ry`, where `Rx` and `Ry` are the number of ranks (divisions) in the x and y direction. Relaxing the requirements should not be too difficult. Nice, thanks for that explanation. Why are we following 2decomp? PencilArrays has some benchmarking that shows it can compete with the fastest codes out there. I don't see anything similar for 2decomp, so I can't figure out what the motivation for following that strategy would be. I'm not sure if they are different, either. Something we do not previously support (but which is implemented in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538) was an algorithm that could support any topology with vertically-stretched grids. What is the relationship between this PR and https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538, and does this PR support vertically stretched grids?. One of the main limitations of PencilArrays from our perspective is that it could not distribute an array along the first dimension. Since we almost always would like to use vertically stretched grids (and for various reasons, we may want to also compute the hydrostatic pressure with a vertical integral), ocean LES are typically distributed in x and y.

This PR is exploratory and is a fallback that might not be merged if we find an efficient way to do GPU transposes with PencilArrays (requires reducing memory allocations and improving the efficiency of permute operations) and implement r2r Fourier transforms in PencilFFTs. For the moment those two elements are part of this PR.; > ; > This PR follows the (simple) configuration of the 2decomp library https://github.com/2decomp-fft/2decomp-fft, the difference between PencilFFT/PencilArray and this PR (a part bounded domain ffts) is that here (at the moment) we impose the stricter limitation that `Ny` has to be divisible by `Rx` and `Ry` while `Nz` has to be divisible by `Ry`, where `Rx` and `Ry` are the number of ranks (divisions) in the x and y direction. Relaxing the requirements should not be too difficult. Nice, thanks for that explanation. Why are we following 2decomp? PencilArrays has some benchmarking that shows it can compete with the fastest codes out there. I don't see anything similar for 2decomp, so I can't figure out what the motivation for following that strategy would be. I'm not sure if they are different, either. Something we do not previously support (but which is implemented in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538) was an algorithm that could support any topology with vertically-stretched grids. What is the relationship between this PR and https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538, and does this PR support vertically stretched grids?. One of the main limitations of PencilArrays from our perspective is that it could not distribute an array along the first dimension. Since we almost always would like to use vertically stretched grids (and for various reasons, we may want to also compute the hydrostatic pressure with a vertical integral), ocean LES are typically distributed in x and y. Therefore, in order to support 2D domain decompositions, we were faced with somehow ch
