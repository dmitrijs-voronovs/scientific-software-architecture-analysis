Availability,"""""""; A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available:; - Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).; - Medical Subject Headings (MESH). To use these configured default KBs, pass the `name` parameter, either 'umls' or 'mesh'. It uses a sklearn.TfidfVectorizer to embed mention text into a sparse embedding of character 3-grams.; These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of; a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids.; This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical; entity. This point is important for two reasons:. 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids; are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, ""Jefferson County"" may be an; alias for both the canonical ids ""Jefferson County, Iowa"" and ""Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely; valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive; k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings; which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results; in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn; baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a; classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended!.
