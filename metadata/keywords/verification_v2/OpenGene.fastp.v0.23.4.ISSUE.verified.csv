Energy Efficiency,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you. Thanks!

Integrability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is.

Modifiability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you. Thanks!

Content: Yes, sure.; Here are two examples. The file barcode6.txt contain the simplest case. A barcode and the corresponding sample name on the same line (tab separated). The second file barcodesPool1.txt contains a combinatorial case, a sample corresponding to a combination of barcode and an index. In the case of the second file, often, the files were already demultiplexed with the Illumina software and the index tags are added to the IDs of the sequences (so barcode is inline and index is in the ID name).

Use `cut_right_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_right_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. This is similar as the Trimmomatic `SLIDINGWINDOW` method. ***WARNING: all these three operations will interfere deduplication for SE data, and `--cut_front` or `--cut_right` may also interfere deduplication for PE data. The deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.***.

Safety,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.

Simply change the input and output directory path in the script and run the script:. ```import os; import subprocess. # Set input and output dirs; input_dir = ""INPUT/DIRECTORY""; output_dir = ""OUTPUT/DIRECTORY"". os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True). # Loop over all input files; for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):; if ""_R1_"" in filename and filename.endswith("".fastq""):; in1 = os.path.join(input_dir, filename); out1 = os.path.join(output_dir, filename); in2 = in1.replace(""_R1_"", ""_R2_""); out2 = out1.replace(""_R1_"", ""_R2_""). # Now run fastp command; if os.path.exists(in2):; command = f""fastp --in1 {in1} --out1 {out1} --in2 {in2} --out2 {out2} -w 10""; print(f""Running command: {command}""); subprocess.run(command, shell=True); else:; print(f""Matching _R2_ file not found for {in1}""); else:; print(f""{filename} does not include '_R1_' or is not a fastq file"")```

Usability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.
