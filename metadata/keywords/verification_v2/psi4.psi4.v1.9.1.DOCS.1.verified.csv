Deployability," (*e.g.*, in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems. This is the default for; systems of more than one atom.; SADNO; Natural orbitals from Superposition of Atomic Densities. Similar; to the above, but it forms natural orbitals from the SAD density; matrix to get proper orbitals which are used to start the; calculation, see [Lehtola:2019:1593]_.; GWH; A generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz modification of the core; Hamiltonian matrix. Usually less accurate than the core guess: the; latter is exact for one-electron systems, GWH is not; see; [Lehtola:2019:1593]_).; HUCKEL; An extended H\ |u_dots|\ ckel guess based on on-the-fly atomic UHF; calculations alike SAD, see [Lehtola:2019:1593]_.; MODHUCKEL; Like HUCKEL, an extended H\ |u_dots|\ ckel guess based on; on-the-fly atomic UHF calculations alike SAD, see; [Lehtola:2019:1593]_. This variant employs an updated rule for the; generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholz formula from [Ammeter:1978:3686]_.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a ``wfn`` file, casting from; one basis to another if needed. Useful for starting anion; computations from neutral orbitals, or after small geometry; changes. At present, casting from a different molecular point; group is not supported. This becomes the default for the second; and later iterations of geometry optimizations.; SAP; Superposition of Atomic Potentials. This is essentially a; modification of the core Hamiltonian, which includes screening; effects by using a radially screened effective atomic charge.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content:  (*e.g.*, in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems. This is the default for; systems of more than one atom.; SADNO; Natural orbitals from Superposition of Atomic Densities. Similar; to the above, but it forms natural orbitals from the SAD density; matrix to get proper orbitals which are used to start the; calculation, see [Lehtola:2019:1593]_.; GWH; A generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz modification of the core; Hamiltonian matrix. Usually less accurate than the core guess: the; latter is exact for one-electron systems, GWH is not; see; [Lehtola:2019:1593]_).; HUCKEL; An extended H\ |u_dots|\ ckel guess based on on-the-fly atomic UHF; calculations alike SAD, see [Lehtola:2019:1593]_.; MODHUCKEL; Like HUCKEL, an extended H\ |u_dots|\ ckel guess based on; on-the-fly atomic UHF calculations alike SAD, see; [Lehtola:2019:1593]_. This variant employs an updated rule for the; generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholz formula from [Ammeter:1978:3686]_.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a ``wfn`` file, casting from; one basis to another if needed. Useful for starting anion; computations from neutral orbitals, or after small geometry; changes. At present, casting from a different molecular point; group is not supported. This becomes the default for the second; and later iterations of geometry optimizations.; SAP; Superposition of Atomic Potentials. This is essentially a; modification of the core Hamiltonian, which includes screening; effects by using a radially screened effective atomic charge.

However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to*; :ref:`Kallay's MRCC <sec:mrcc>` *code.*. The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216]_, or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140]_.; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order ; *active space* coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by K\ |a_acute|\ llay, to which |PSIfour| can interface (see Section; :ref:`sec:mrcc`); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC.

Deployability," within a composite framework; are as follows:. COSX; An algorithm based on the semi-numerical ""chain of spheres exchange"" (COSX); approach described in [Neese:2009:98]_. The coulomb term is computed with a; direct density-fitting algorithm. The COSX algorithm uses no I/O, scales; well with system size, and requires minimal memory, making it ideal for; large systems and multi-core CPUs. See :ref:`sec:scfcosx` for more information.; LINK; An implementation of the linear-scaling ""Linear Exchange"" (LinK); algorithm described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663]_. The LINK algorithm provides ; many of the benefits of integral-direct SCF algorithms, including no disk I/O, ; low memory usage, and effective parallelization. Additionally, the; LINK implementation scales well with system size ; while simultaneously providing a formally-exact computation of the ; Exchange term. See :ref:`sec:scflink` for more information. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DF; A DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content:  within a composite framework; are as follows:. COSX; An algorithm based on the semi-numerical ""chain of spheres exchange"" (COSX); approach described in [Neese:2009:98]_. The coulomb term is computed with a; direct density-fitting algorithm. The COSX algorithm uses no I/O, scales; well with system size, and requires minimal memory, making it ideal for; large systems and multi-core CPUs. See :ref:`sec:scfcosx` for more information.; LINK; An implementation of the linear-scaling ""Linear Exchange"" (LinK); algorithm described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663]_. The LINK algorithm provides ; many of the benefits of integral-direct SCF algorithms, including no disk I/O, ; low memory usage, and effective parallelization. Additionally, the; LINK implementation scales well with system size ; while simultaneously providing a formally-exact computation of the ; Exchange term. See :ref:`sec:scflink` for more information. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DF; A DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used.; DISK_DF; A DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword ""DF""; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; |PSIfours| internal routines. Ex

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment; ------------------------------------------------------. |PSIfour| has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package ``psi4-dev`` is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler |PSIfour| from source. Go to; :psicode:`installs/latest`, select ""source"" and ""nightly build"" along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version.

Included in |PSIfour| is functionality to automatically render specified surfaces, including molecular orbitals,; densities, and basis functions, using VMD. The vmd_cube.py script takes the .cube files generated; in a calculation and generates images aligned with user-input specifications. The script is located; in :source:`psi4/share/psi4/scripts/vmd_cube.py`. Script Prerequisites; --------------------. 1. VMD must be installed, and it can be downloaded for free at (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Additionally,; the script needs to know where to find the VMD executable, and this is defined as :envvar:`VMDPATH`. VMDPATH must be defined as; an environment variable. 2. To generate images with multiple surfaces, ImageMagick must also be installed. ImageMagick is a free program which; can be installed using homebrew/pip or from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php . 3. With ImageMagick installed, an environment variable called :envvar:`MONTAGE` needs to be created which points to the montage executable.; This executable can be found in the /bin/ sub-directory wherever ImageMagick was installed. .. envvar:: VMDPATH. Filesystem path to the VMD executable. .. envvar:: MONTAGE. Filesystem path to the Montage executable of ImageMagick. Running the Script; ------------------. 1.

Orbital Visualization with VMD; ==============================. Included in |PSIfour| is functionality to automatically render specified surfaces, including molecular orbitals,; densities, and basis functions, using VMD. The vmd_cube.py script takes the .cube files generated; in a calculation and generates images aligned with user-input specifications. The script is located; in :source:`psi4/share/psi4/scripts/vmd_cube.py`. Script Prerequisites; --------------------. 1. VMD must be installed, and it can be downloaded for free at (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Additionally,; the script needs to know where to find the VMD executable, and this is defined as :envvar:`VMDPATH`. VMDPATH must be defined as; an environment variable. 2. To generate images with multiple surfaces, ImageMagick must also be installed. ImageMagick is a free program which; can be installed using homebrew/pip or from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php . 3. With ImageMagick installed, an environment variable called :envvar:`MONTAGE` needs to be created which points to the montage executable.; This executable can be found in the /bin/ sub-directory wherever ImageMagick was installed. .. envvar:: VMDPATH. Filesystem path to the VMD executable. .. envvar:: MONTAGE. Filesystem path to the Montage executable of ImageMagick. Running the Script; ------------------. 1.

Deployability,"C and A/B) gets one electron [Luu:2023:356]_. This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond. Several schemes for determining this link hybrid were proposed ; in [Luu:2023:356]_ and they all are implemented in |PSIfour|. We recommend the so-called *SIAO1* scheme,; ``fisapt_link_assignment siao1``, as it has been observed to provide consistently meaningful I-SAPT terms and a; smooth basis set convergence.

Content: C and A/B) gets one electron [Luu:2023:356]_. This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond. Several schemes for determining this link hybrid were proposed ; in [Luu:2023:356]_ and they all are implemented in |PSIfour|. We recommend the so-called *SIAO1* scheme,; ``fisapt_link_assignment siao1``, as it has been observed to provide consistently meaningful I-SAPT terms and a; smooth basis set convergence.

Updating the |PSIfour| Users' and Programmers' Manual; =====================================================. |PSIfours| documentation is generated by `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_; and lives in :source:`doc/sphinxman`. It is available online at; `<http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/index.html>`_; for the latest development branch. Installing Sphinx; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation ; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from psicode, so most users and developers won't need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; Math is rendered through MathJax, so LaTeX and dvipng are no longer needed.; The sphinx executable should be in your path at CMake configure time for; documentation targets to be available. * Binary: ``conda install sphinx``; * Binary: ``conda env create -f devtools/conda-envs/docs-cf.yaml``; * Binary: ``pip install -U Sphinx``; * Source: https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/. * Check:. >>> which sphinx-build; //anaconda/bin/sphinx-build; >>> sphinx-build --version # needs >= 3.5; Sphinx (sphinx-build) 3.5.3; >>> cmake; ...; -- Documentation targets available: sphinxman (html), sphinxmini (quick html), sphinxpdf (LaTeX --> PDF); ... Documentation Structure; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in the same; format, hyperlinking within and to external websites, and generating; documentation in different formats from the same source. |PSIfours|; document

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: by a single iteration of the orbital update and orbital transformation; of the integrals. The macroiterations are repeated until the simultaneous; convergence of the cumulant and orbitals is achieved.; Convergence of the simultaneous algorithm is accelerated using the; DIIS extrapolation technique. TWOSTEP; In the two-step algorithm each macroiteration consists of two sets of; microiterations. In the first set, the density cumulant equations are solved; iteratively, while the orbitals are kept fixed. After the density cumulant is; converged, the second set of microiterations is performed for the; self-consistent update of the orbitals with the fixed density cumulant. Each; macroiteration is completed by performing the orbital transformation of the; integrals. As in the simultaneous algorithm, the DIIS; extrapolation is used to accelerate convergence. Two-step algorithm is; only available for the DC-06 and DC-12 methods. QC; In the quadratically-convergent algorithm, the; orbital and cumulant update equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson; method. Each macroiteration of the quadratically-convergent algorithm consists; of a single Newton-Raphson update followed by the orbital transformation; of the integrals. The solution of the Newton-Raphson equations is performed; iteratively using the preconditioned conjugate gradients method, where only the; product of the electronic Hessian with the step vector is computed for; efficiency. By default, the electronic Hessian is build for both the cumulant and orbital; updates and both updates are performed simultaneously. Setting the |dct__qc_type|; option to ``TWOSTEP`` will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,; while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.; If requested by the user (set |dct__qc_coupling| to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include; matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.; The computation of these coupling elements increa

This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond. Several schemes for determining this link hybrid were proposed ; in [Luu:2023:356]_ and they all are implemented in |PSIfour|. We recommend the so-called *SIAO1* scheme,; ``fisapt_link_assignment siao1``, as it has been observed to provide consistently meaningful I-SAPT terms and a; smooth basis set convergence. The SIAO1 name implies that the projection to construct the link hybrids happens in the; intrinsic atomic orbital space (as opposed to the SAO1 method where the standard atomic orbital space is used), with; one iteration of fragment orbital optimization and link orbital orthogonalization, a process that very quickly ; achieves self-consistency. Altogether, the allowed values for |fisapt__fisapt_link_assignment| are ``c`` (default),; ``ab`` (the opposite of ``c`` where the enti

As Rule 1 of the above policy states, all bug fixes of the code; already in the recent stable release must go on the corresponding branch,; not on the main trunk. The next step depends on the severity of the bug:; \begin{enumerate}; \item If the bug fix is critical and potentially affects every; developer of the code on the main trunk, then \PSIfour\; administrators should be notified of the fix. If deemed necessary,; appropriate steps to create a new patch release will be made. Once; the next patch release is created then the bug fixes will be merged; onto the main trunk.

As Rule 1 of the above policy states, all bug fixes of the code; already in the recent stable release must go on the corresponding branch,; not on the main trunk. The next step depends on the severity of the bug:; \begin{enumerate}; \item If the bug fix is critical and potentially affects every; developer of the code on the main trunk, then \PSIfour\; administrators should be notified of the fix. If deemed necessary,; appropriate steps to create a new patch release will be made. Once; the next patch release is created then the bug fixes will be merged; onto the main trunk. If the bug fix doesn't warrant an immediate; new patch release, then you can incorporate the bug fix into your; local copy of the main trunk code manually or using SVN merge; features. This will allow you to continue development until next; patch release is created and the bug fix is incorporated into the; main trunk code in the repository.

This COSX implementation uses two separate grids.; By default, the SCF algorithm is first converged on a smaller grid, followed by a; number of SCF iterations up to a maximum value (controlled by the |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| keyword); on a larger grid. By default, |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| is set to 1, a single; SCF iteration, which results in numerical errors comparable to; performing the entire SCF on the expensive larger grid at a computational cost; much closer to the smaller grid. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to 0 disables the; larger grid entirely. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to -1 allows; for the SCF to fully converge on the larger grid, useful for the study of wavefunction; properties such as gradients. The size of the initial grid is controlled by the keywords; |scf__cosx_radial_points_initial| and |scf__cosx_spherical_points_initial|.; The final grid is controlled by |scf__cosx

Lastly, |scf__cosx_basis_tolerance| is; a cutoff for the value of basis functions at grid points. This keyword is; used to determine the radial extent of the each basis shell, and it is the; COSX analogue to |scf__dft_basis_tolerance|. The |scf__incfock| keyword (defaults to ``false``) increases performance; by constructing the Fock matrix from differences in the density matrix, which; are more amenable to screening. This option is disabled by default because of; potential SCF convergence issues, particularly when using diffuse basis functions.; The |scf__cosx_overlap_fitting| keyword (defaults to ``true``) reduces numerical; integration errors using the method described in [Izsak:2011:144105]_ and is; always recommended. .. _`sec:scflink`:.

Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especi",integrat,MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst:41453,integration,41453,doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst,1,['integrat'],['integration'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Content: ensity_tolerance|, and; |scf__cosx_basis_tolerance| keywords, respectively. |scf__cosx_ints_tolerance|; is the most consequential of the three thresholds in both cost and accuracy.; This keyword determines screening of negligible one-electron integrals.; |scf__cosx_density_tolerance| controls the threshold for significant; shell pairs in the density matrix. Lastly, |scf__cosx_basis_tolerance| is; a cutoff for the value of basis functions at grid points. This keyword is; used to determine the radial extent of the each basis shell, and it is the; COSX analogue to |scf__dft_basis_tolerance|. The |scf__incfock| keyword (defaults to ``false``) increases performance; by constructing the Fock matrix from differences in the density matrix, which; are more amenable to screening. This option is disabled by default because of; potential SCF convergence issues, particularly when using diffuse basis functions.; The |scf__cosx_overlap_fitting| keyword (defaults to ``true``) reduces numerical; integration errors using the method described in [Izsak:2011:144105]_ and is; always recommended. .. _`sec:scflink`:. Linear Exchange; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Large SCF calculations can benefit from specialized screening procedures that further reduce the scaling of the ERI contribution to the Fock matrix.; LinK, the linear-scaling exchange method described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663]_, is available in Psi4 in conjunction with composite algorithms that build J (|globals__scf_type| set to ``J_alg+LINK``).; LinK achieves linear-scaling by exploiting shell pair sparsity in the density matrix and overlap sparsity between shell pairs. Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especi

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: index. - Note the edition string ``v182`` in frontmatter for this and future filenames.; - Don't postdate the date string in frontmatter or it won't render.; - Ultimately, make sure the ``aliases:\n - /installs/latest/`` lines are *added* to this new file; and *removed* from the previous latest file, but this can wait until the installer page has been tested. * Copy and edit a new file akin to ``data/installs/v182.yaml``. Add it to the git index. - Glance through the menu and notes content to make sure they're up-to-date. This file determines; the structure of the install page.; - Add or remove python versions and architectures if necessary.; - Every couple years, update the default python version in ``datakey: python``/``selected`` *and*; in ``optsHandler`` at the end.; - Always adjust the ``datakey: branch``/``stable`` block.; - For releases, adjust the ``datakey: branch``/``previous`` and ``nightly`` blocks. * Enter the ``scripts/`` directory. If the previous release hasn't had a snapshot saved, copy; ``install-generator.py`` into a version-labeled file, and add it to the git index.; * Edit ``scripts/install-generator.py``. - Primarily, edit ``edition`` at the top.; - Also, edit other arrays (stuff above ``## Outputs``) or messages (logic below ``## Outputs``); that should change. * Run the ``install-generator.py`` in place. It will dump two new files, e.g.,; ``data/installs/cmd/{edition}.json`` and ``data/installs/dlbtn/{edition}.json``. Add these to the; index (no need to inspect them). * The installer page is now ready for inspection. Run ``hugo server --watch=false`` and view in; browser at http://localhost:1313/ . Click around the options to make sure the buttons and; instructions all look right. * Iterate on the ``data/installs/{edition}.yaml`` and the ``install-generator.py`` until correct.; It's fine to push to psicode.org to see it in place. But wait until it's final (and all the; packages and installers are ready) to shift ""latest"" alias in frontmatter
