Availability," or other similar arguments these should; refer to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21. Fourth and finally, if running in training mode the `truth_vcf` and; `confident_regions` arguments should point to VCF and BED files containing the; true variants and regions where we are confident in our calls (i.e., calls; within these regions and not in the truth_vcf are considered false positives).; These should be bgzipped and tabix indexed and be on a reference consistent with; the one provided with the `--ref` argument. ### call_variants. `call_variants` consumes TFRecord file(s) of tf.Examples protos created; by `make_examples` and a deep learning model checkpoint and evaluates the model; on each example in the input TFRecord. The output here is a TFRecord of; CallVariantsOutput protos. `call_variants` doesn't directly support sharding its; outputs, but accepts a glob or shard-pattern for its inputs. `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and uses TensorFlow for evaluation.; When evaluating a model in CPU mode, TensorFlow can make use of multiple cores,; but scaling is sub-linear. In other words, `call_variants` on a 64 core machine; is less than 8x faster than running on a 8 core machine. When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs; fewer CPUs. Based on a small number of experiments, currently the most efficient; configuration for `call_variants` on a GPU instance is 4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU.; Compared to our setting in the [whole genome case study], we noticed a 2.5x; speedup on the call_variants step using a single P100 GPU and 8 CPUs. Note that; currently `call_variants` can only use one GPU at most.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content:  or other similar arguments these should; refer to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21. Fourth and finally, if running in training mode the `truth_vcf` and; `confident_regions` arguments should point to VCF and BED files containing the; true variants and regions where we are confident in our calls (i.e., calls; within these regions and not in the truth_vcf are considered false positives).; These should be bgzipped and tabix indexed and be on a reference consistent with; the one provided with the `--ref` argument. ### call_variants. `call_variants` consumes TFRecord file(s) of tf.Examples protos created; by `make_examples` and a deep learning model checkpoint and evaluates the model; on each example in the input TFRecord. The output here is a TFRecord of; CallVariantsOutput protos. `call_variants` doesn't directly support sharding its; outputs, but accepts a glob or shard-pattern for its inputs. `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and uses TensorFlow for evaluation.; When evaluating a model in CPU mode, TensorFlow can make use of multiple cores,; but scaling is sub-linear. In other words, `call_variants` on a 64 core machine; is less than 8x faster than running on a 8 core machine. When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs; fewer CPUs. Based on a small number of experiments, currently the most efficient; configuration for `call_variants` on a GPU instance is 4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU.; Compared to our setting in the [whole genome case study], we noticed a 2.5x; speedup on the call_variants step using a single P100 GPU and 8 CPUs. Note that; currently `call_variants` can only use one GPU at most.

Availability,"; Key changes and improvements include:. * Rearchitected with open source release in mind; * Built on [TensorFlow]; * Increased variant calling accuracy, especially for indels; * Vastly faster with reduced memory usage. We have made a number of improvements to the methodology as well. The biggest; change was to move away from RGB-encoded (3-channel) pileup images and instead; represent the aligned read data using a multi-channel tensor data layout. We; currently represent the data as a 6-channel raw tensor in which we encode:. * The read base (A, C, G, T); * The base's quality score; * The read's mapping quality score; * The read's strand (positive or negative); * Does the read support the allele being evaluated?; * Does the base match the reference genome at this position?. These are all readily derived from the information found in the BAM file; encoding of each read. Additional modeling changes were to move to the inception-v3 architecture and to; train on many more independent sequencing replicates of the ground truth; training samples, including 50% downsampled versions of each of those read sets.; In our testing this allowed the model to better generalize to other data types. In the end these changes reduced our error rate by more than 50% on the held out; evaluation sample (NA24385 / HG002) as compared to our results in the; [PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge](https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/truth/results/):.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: ; Key changes and improvements include:. * Rearchitected with open source release in mind; * Built on [TensorFlow]; * Increased variant calling accuracy, especially for indels; * Vastly faster with reduced memory usage. We have made a number of improvements to the methodology as well. The biggest; change was to move away from RGB-encoded (3-channel) pileup images and instead; represent the aligned read data using a multi-channel tensor data layout. We; currently represent the data as a 6-channel raw tensor in which we encode:. * The read base (A, C, G, T); * The base's quality score; * The read's mapping quality score; * The read's strand (positive or negative); * Does the read support the allele being evaluated?; * Does the base match the reference genome at this position?. These are all readily derived from the information found in the BAM file; encoding of each read. Additional modeling changes were to move to the inception-v3 architecture and to; train on many more independent sequencing replicates of the ground truth; training samples, including 50% downsampled versions of each of those read sets.; In our testing this allowed the model to better generalize to other data types. In the end these changes reduced our error rate by more than 50% on the held out; evaluation sample (NA24385 / HG002) as compared to our results in the; [PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge](https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/truth/results/):.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: dataset will be evaluated at the end of; each epoch, and every n training steps specified by `--config.tune_every_steps`.; You can lower `--config.tune_every_steps` to perform evaluation more frequently. Checkpoints are stored whenever the `tune/f1_weighted` metric improves when; evaluating the tune dataset. In this way, the last checkpoint stored will always; be the best performing checkpoint. The best performing checkpoint metric can be; configured using `--config.best_checkpoint_metric`. We have tested training with 1 and 2 GPUs and observed the following runtimes:. n GPUs | Time; ------ | ----------; 1 | 89m39.451s; 2 | 54m8.163s. Once training is complete, the following command can be used list checkpoints:. ```bash; gsutil ls ${TRAINING_DIR}/checkpoints/; ```. The best checkpoint can be retrieved using the following command:. ```bash; BEST_CHECKPOINT=$(gsutil cat ${TRAINING_DIR}/checkpoints/checkpoint | sed -n 's/model_checkpoint_path: ""\(.*\)""/\1/p'); BEST_CHECKPOINT=${TRAINING_DIR}/checkpoints/${BEST_CHECKPOINT}; ```. ### (Optional) Use TensorBoard to visualize progress.

For example, using the setup shown; in the README and looking inside the `/input` volume:. ```; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1""; docker run \; -v ""YOUR_INPUT_DIR"":""/input"" \; -v ""YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR:/output"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; ls /input; ```. Mounting directories with Docker can be confusing. One trick to make this; simpler is to set both sides as your `$HOME`, so the paths are the same inside; and outside the Docker container. ```; echo $HOME # see what your home directory is first.; ls $HOME; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1""; sudo docker run \; -v ""${HOME}"":""${HOME}"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; ls $HOME; ```. ## How do I run multi-sample calling?.

No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU; inference yet. ##

DeepVariant has previously been applied to plant species. In the case of rice,; there was good evidence of high accuracy. You can see; [some results in this blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/analyzing-3024-rice-genomes-characterized-by-deepvariant).; However, these rice genomes were diploid and with a similar variant density of; humans. DeepVariant is currently written to be a diploid variant caller. So if the plant; species you are working with is polyploid, it is not yet clear how DeepVariant; will perform. That is because even with re-training, DeepVariant can only; produce variant calls that are homozygous alternate, heterozygous, or homozygous; reference, which don

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: ript, supply a `--logging_dir`; directory and set `--runtime_report`. For example, when following the; [quick start](deepvariant-quick-start.md), including `--runtime_report; --logging_dir=/output/logs` would produce the following runtime profiling output; file and visual report:. ```; /output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region/make_examples_runtime-00000-of-00001.tsv; /output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region_report.html; ```. ### Running stages individually. If you are using make_examples itself without the run_deepvariant script, supply; make_examples with `--runtime_by_region=` a filename (.tsv). If the examples are; sharded then the runtime profile should be sharded into the same number of; shards, e.g. when using `examples@64` then runtimes could be `runtimes@64.tsv`. Then use the `runtime_by_region_vis` script to create a visual report of the; make_examples runtime by region data. Continuing from the quick start, it looks; like this:. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"" # Only available in v1.1+.; docker run \; -v ""INPUT_DIR"":""/input"" \; -v ""OUTPUT_DIR:/output"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/runtime_by_region_vis \; --input=/output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region/make_examples_runtime-00000-of-00001.tsv \; --output=/output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region/make_examples_runtime_vis.html \; --title=""Quick start runtime profiling""; ```. ## Interpreting the runtime report. ### Where the data comes from. `make_examples`, the first stage of DeepVariant, starts from a BAM file and; corresponding reference FASTA file. One 1000 bp region at a time (set by; `--partition_size`), `make_examples` will:. 1. Get reads: Query the bam files for all the reads in the region. Optionally; (`--realign_reads`) do a local assembly of the reads and realign the reads; to the resulting haplotype graph. 2. Find candidates: Catalogue all the putative alternate alleles for all those; reads, and compare the accumulated evidence for each alt against th

Content: ----; [Docker](docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md) | This is the recommended method.; [Build from source](docs/deepvariant-build-test.md) | DeepVariant comes with scripts to build it on Ubuntu 20.04. To build and run on other Unix-based systems, you will need to modify these scripts.; Prebuilt Binaries | Available at [`gs://deepvariant/`](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant). These are compiled to use SSE4 and AVX instructions, so you will need a CPU (such as Intel Sandy Bridge) that supports them.

This case study describes one way to train such a custom model using a GPU, in; this case for BGISEQ-500 data. Please note that there is not yet a production-grade training pipeline.

The Google Cloud SDK comes with two very useful command line utilities that you; can use on your local workstation---`gcloud`, which lets you administer your; cloud resources, and `gsutil`, which lets you manage and transfer data to Google; Cloud Storage buckets. We will make use of these tools in the following; instructions. To install the Cloud SDK, [follow the installation instructions; here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads). The final step in the installation process (`gcloud init`) will have you; authenticate via your web browser and select a default [zone and; region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones) for; your cloud resources, which you can choose based on your location and regional; hardware availability. NOTE: Not all zones are equipped with GPUs, so if you want to use GPUs for your; project, please take note of the availability listing; [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/). To verify that the installation and authentication succeeded, run. ```shell; gcloud auth list; ```. and verify that your account email address is printed. ## Starting a Compute Engine instance. A simple way to access compute on GCP is Google Compute Engine. Compute Engine; instances can be sized to meet computational and storage needs for your project.

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: this case study we describe applying DeepVariant to PacBio HiFi reads to call; variants. We will call small variants from a publicly available whole genome; HiFi dataset from PacBio. Starting in v1.4.0, PacBio calling uses one-step variant calling. If you're; looking for documentation for the two-step process, please look at v1.3.0. ## Prepare environment. ### Tools. [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) will be used to run DeepVariant and; [hap.py](https://github.com/illumina/hap.py), and we'll use; [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and a conda; environment to handle the other dependencies for the case study and samtools. - singularity (must be installed by `root` user; outside of the scope of this; case study); - samtools. ```bash; # add channels to conda configuration; conda config --add channels defaults; conda config --add channels bioconda; conda config --add channels conda-forge. # create the environment and install dependencies; conda create -y -n deepvariant_env; conda activate deepvariant_env; conda install -y samtools==1.10; ```. ### Download Reference.

",True,"The provided content discusses technical details related to resource efficiency in a deep learning model, but does not relate to the quality attribute of energy efficiency in software engineering."
Energy Efficiency,"is; important to first determine whether a candidate variant was proposed by; DeepVariant. A potential variant requires at least 2 reads to support a variant; and a minimum fraction of reads supporting the variant (0.12 for SNPs and PacBio; Indels, 0.06 for Illumina Indels). All sites that have been generated as; candidates are written in the VCF file, so if you do not see a row in the VCF; file for the variant in question, it means that a candidate was not made.; However, within these sites certain possible alleles may have been pruned in; reporting. To see all alleles, you may add: `--debug_output_all_candidates=ALT`; in the postprocess_variants step. To increase the sensitivity of DeepVariant to these sites, you may add the; following parameters, here shown with their defaults:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""vsc_min_count_snps=2,vsc_min_fraction_snps=0.12,vsc_min_count_indels=2,vsc_min_fraction_indels=0.06""; ```. It is sometimes also the case that realignment of the reads within DeepVariant; changes or reduces the evidence supporting the variant.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content: is; important to first determine whether a candidate variant was proposed by; DeepVariant. A potential variant requires at least 2 reads to support a variant; and a minimum fraction of reads supporting the variant (0.12 for SNPs and PacBio; Indels, 0.06 for Illumina Indels). All sites that have been generated as; candidates are written in the VCF file, so if you do not see a row in the VCF; file for the variant in question, it means that a candidate was not made.; However, within these sites certain possible alleles may have been pruned in; reporting. To see all alleles, you may add: `--debug_output_all_candidates=ALT`; in the postprocess_variants step. To increase the sensitivity of DeepVariant to these sites, you may add the; following parameters, here shown with their defaults:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""vsc_min_count_snps=2,vsc_min_fraction_snps=0.12,vsc_min_count_indels=2,vsc_min_fraction_indels=0.06""; ```. It is sometimes also the case that realignment of the reads within DeepVariant; changes or reduces the evidence supporting the variant. To check for this, try; using the `--norealign_reads` flag to turn off realignment temporarily. Note; that we don't recommend turning off the realigner for Illumina data in general; cases because the realigner improves accuracy overall.

A few things to note before we start:. * It is recommended to use BAM files with original quality scores. In the case; that BAM files went through recalibration, optional DV flags can be used in; order to use original scores: `--parse_sam_aux_fields`,; `--use_original_quality_scores`.; * DeepVariant optionally allows gVCF output. This option is required for; further GLnexus analysis in this document. ## Dataset. The Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset we're using is from:.

The main advantage of DeepTrio is that genetic inheritance is; considered by a neural network for calling variants in trio samples. Also,; variant candidates are generated from all samples at once, which ensures a; genotype call is made for any position in the trio with a variant. Since; DeepTrio is built on top of DeepVariant,; [general information](deepvariant-details.md) for DeepVariant also applies to; DeepTrio. At the highest level, a user needs to provide the following:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format); format and its corresponding; [.fai index file](http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html) generated using the; `samtools faidx` command. 1.

The reads must be aligned to the reference genome; described above. The output of DeepTrio is a set of variants in; [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf) format representing the; child and one or two parents. Similar to DeepVariant, DeepTrio is composed of three stages: `make_examples`,; `call_variants`, and `postprocess_variants`. Some of the components (; `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`) are shared with DeepVariant, and; `make_examples` is specialized for DeepTrio. More details about each program are; described in detail in the; [Inputs and outputs](deepvariant-details.md#inputs-and-outputs) section of the; DeepVariant documentation. DeepTrio comes with three models for different types of input data:. * Illumina whole genome data (WGS).; * Illumina whole exome data (WES).; * PacBio HiFi whole genome data (PacBio WGS). ## Running DeepTrio.

The number of non-variant records created when running DeepVariant in gVCF; depends highly on the sequencing depth of the input sample. This is because the; gVCF records at adjacent sites are merged when the genotype qualities are equal,; and we limit the possible genotype quality seen to be at most 50. For; deeply-sequenced individuals (e.g. 30-50x coverage), many sites hit the GQ=50; cap and are merged into few records. Samples with lower sequencing depth have; more sites within the dynamic range of the binomial model used to estimate; non-variant site g

And then run GLnexus with this config:. ```; sudo docker pull quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7. time sudo docker run \; -v ""${DIR}"":""/data"" \; quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7 \; /usr/local/bin/glnexus_cli \; --config DeepVariantWES \; --bed ""/data/${CAPTURE_BED}"" \; /data/HG004.g.vcf.gz /data/HG003.g.vcf.gz /data/HG002.g.vcf.gz \; | sudo docker run -i google/deepvariant:${VERSION} bcftools view - \; | sudo docker run -i google/deepvariant:${VERSION} bgzip -c \; > ${DIR}/deepvariant.cohort.vcf.gz; ```. When we ran on this WES trio, it took only about 13 seconds. For more details on; performance, see; [GLnexus performance guide](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/wiki/Performance). For a WGS cohort, we recommend using `--config DeepVariantWGS` instead of; `DeepVariantWES`. Another preset `DeepVariant_unfiltered` is available in; `glnexus:v1.2.7` or later versions for merging DeepVariant gVCFs with no QC; filters or genotype revision (see; [GitHub issue #326](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/326) for a; potential use case). The details of these presets can be found; [here](../deepvariant/cohort_best_practice). ## Annotate the merged VCF with Mendelian discordance information using RTG Tools. Create an SDF template from our reference file:. ```; sudo docker run \; -v ""${DIR}"":""/data"" \; realtimegenomics/rtg-tools format \; -o /data/hs37d5.sdf /data/hs37d5.fa; ```. Create a PED file `$DIR/trio.ped` that looks like this (with the sample name; of the trio):. ```; FILE=""${DIR}/trio.ped""; cat <<EOM >$FILE; #PED format pedigree; #; #fam-id/ind-id/pat-id/mat-id: 0=unknown; #sex: 1=male; 2=female; 0=unknown; #phenotype: -9=missing, 0=missing; 1=unaffected; 2=affected; #; #fam-id ind-id pat-id mat-id sex ph

Performance,"# Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant (WES trio demonstration). ## Overview. This document outlines all the steps and considerations for calling and merging; a trio using DeepVariant and [GLnexus](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus).; These best practices were developed and evaluated as described in the article; published in _Bioinformatics_:; [Accurate, scalable cohort variant calls using DeepVariant and GLnexus](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1081); (2021). The process involves 3 major stages: running DeepVariant to create individual; genome call sets, running GLnexus to merge call sets, and analyzing the merged; call set. NOTE: This case study demonstrates an example of how to run DeepVariant; end-to-end on one machine. The steps below were done on a machine with this; [example command to start a machine](deepvariant-details.md#command-for-a-cpu-only-machine-on-google-cloud-platform). The steps in this document can be extended to merge larger cohorts as well. See this workflow:. ![workflow](images/cohort-workflow.png?raw=true ""DeepVariant+GLnexus cohort workflow""). A few things to note before we start:. * It is recommended to use BAM files with original quality scores. In the case; that BAM files went through recalibration, optional DV flags can be used in; order to use original scores: `--parse_sam_aux_fields`,; `--use_original_quality_scores`.; * DeepVariant optionally allows gVCF output. This option is required for; further GLnexus analysis in this document. ## Dataset. The Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset we're using is from:. [ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/). * HG002_NA24385_son; * HG003_NA24149_father; * HG004_NA24143_mother. ### Commands for downloading the input BAMs. Just for convenience, we use aria2 to download our data.

Content: # Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant (WES trio demonstration). ## Overview. This document outlines all the steps and considerations for calling and merging; a trio using DeepVariant and [GLnexus](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus).; These best practices were developed and evaluated as described in the article; published in _Bioinformatics_:; [Accurate, scalable cohort variant calls using DeepVariant and GLnexus](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1081); (2021). The process involves 3 major stages: running DeepVariant to create individual; genome call sets, running GLnexus to merge call sets, and analyzing the merged; call set. NOTE: This case study demonstrates an example of how to run DeepVariant; end-to-end on one machine. The steps below were done on a machine with this; [example command to start a machine](deepvariant-details.md#command-for-a-cpu-only-machine-on-google-cloud-platform). The steps in this document can be extended to merge larger cohorts as well. See this workflow:. ![workflow](images/cohort-workflow.png?raw=true ""DeepVariant+GLnexus cohort workflow""). A few things to note before we start:. * It is recommended to use BAM files with original quality scores. In the case; that BAM files went through recalibration, optional DV flags can be used in; order to use original scores: `--parse_sam_aux_fields`,; `--use_original_quality_scores`.; * DeepVariant optionally allows gVCF output. This option is required for; further GLnexus analysis in this document. ## Dataset. The Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset we're using is from:. [ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/). * HG002_NA24385_son; * HG003_NA24149_father; * HG004_NA24143_mother. ### Commands for downloading the input BAMs. Just for convenience, we use aria2 to download our data. You can change it to; whatever other tools (wget, curl) that you prefer. To install aria2, you

Content: eepVariant is highly accurate for; [many types of NGS data](https://rdcu.be/7Dhl), some users may be interested in; training custom deep learning models that have been optimized for very specific; data. This case study describes one way to train such a custom model using a GPU, in; this case for BGISEQ-500 data. Please note that there is not yet a production-grade training pipeline. This is; just one example of how to train a custom model, and is neither the fastest nor; the cheapest possible configuration. The resulting model also does not represent; the greatest achievable accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data. ## High level summary of result. We demonstrated that by training on 1 replicate of BGISEQ-500 whole genome data; (everything except for chromosome 20-22), we can significantly improve the; accuracy comparing to the WGS model as a baseline:. * Indel F1 `94.1615%` --> `98.1937%`; * SNP F1: `99.8785%` --> `99.9042%`. This tutorial is meant as an example for training; all the other processing in; this tutorial were done serially with no pipeline optimization. ## Request a machine. For this case study, we use a [GPU machine] with 16 vCPUs. You can request this; machine on Google Cloud using the following command:. ```bash; host=""${USER}-deepvariant-vm""; zone=""us-west1-b"". gcloud compute instances create ${host} \; --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \; --maintenance-policy ""TERMINATE"" \; --accelerator=type=nvidia-tesla-p100,count=1 \; --image-family ""ubuntu-2004-lts"" \; --image-project ""ubuntu-os-cloud"" \; --machine-type ""n1-standard-16"" \; --boot-disk-size ""300"" \; --zone ""${zone}"" \; --min-cpu-platform ""Intel Skylake""; ```. After a minute or two, your VM should be ready and you can ssh into it using the; following command:. ```bash; gcloud compute ssh ${host} --zone ${zone}; ```. Once you have logged in, set the variables:. ```bash; YOUR_PROJECT=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT; OUTPUT_GCS_BUCKET=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GCS_BUCKET. BUCKET=""gs://deepvariant""; VERSION=

A case study on how to use the parameters mentioned here are described in; [DeepVariant X, Y calling case study](deepvariant-xy-calling-case-study.md). ## Haploid calling support.

To build and run on other Unix-based systems, you will need to modify these scripts.; Prebuilt Binaries | Available at [`gs://deepvariant/`](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant). These are compiled to use SSE4 and AVX instructions, so you will need a CPU (such as Intel Sandy Bridge) that supports them. You can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file on your computer, which lists these features under ""flags"". ## Contribution Guidelines. Please [open a pull request](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/compare) if; you wish to contribute to DeepVariant. Note, we have not set up the; infrastructure to merge pull requests externally. If you agree, we will test and; submit the changes internally and mention your contributions in our; [release notes](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/releases). We apologize; for any inconvenience. If you have any difficulty using DeepVariant, feel free to; [open an issue](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/new). If you have; general questions not specific to DeepVariant, we recommend that you post on a; community discussion forum such as [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/). ## License.

Testability,"0/2 both; become Het (0/x). 1/1 and 3/3 are Hom (x/x). Het - both variants (x/y) includes; all calls with two different alternate alleles, such as 1/2 or 3/5. ### Biallelic base changes. Of all biallelic SNPs, this shows the counts from a particular REF (along the; top labeling the four charts) to a particular ALT (each bar within the charts; labeled at the bottom). See the Ti/Tv section for a brief explanation of why; some of these base changes tend to be more frequent than others. RefCalls and; multi-allelic variants are not included. ### Biallelic Ti/Tv ratio. Transition (Ti) count is the number of biallelic SNPs going from purine->purine; or pyrimidine->pyrimidine, where purines are A and G, pyrimidines are C and T.; Transversions (Tv) are purine->pyrimidine or pyrimidine->purine. Transitions; are biologically more likely to occur than transversions due to the molecular; structure of the bases, so a ratio well above one is desirable.

Content: 0/2 both; become Het (0/x). 1/1 and 3/3 are Hom (x/x). Het - both variants (x/y) includes; all calls with two different alternate alleles, such as 1/2 or 3/5. ### Biallelic base changes. Of all biallelic SNPs, this shows the counts from a particular REF (along the; top labeling the four charts) to a particular ALT (each bar within the charts; labeled at the bottom). See the Ti/Tv section for a brief explanation of why; some of these base changes tend to be more frequent than others. RefCalls and; multi-allelic variants are not included. ### Biallelic Ti/Tv ratio. Transition (Ti) count is the number of biallelic SNPs going from purine->purine; or pyrimidine->pyrimidine, where purines are A and G, pyrimidines are C and T.; Transversions (Tv) are purine->pyrimidine or pyrimidine->purine. Transitions; are biologically more likely to occur than transversions due to the molecular; structure of the bases, so a ratio well above one is desirable.

For more information about CRAM, see the; [`samtools` documentation](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) in general; but particularly the sections on; [Global Options](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#GLOBAL_OPTIONS) and; [reference sequences in CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#REFERENCE_SEQUENCES). `htslib` also hosts a nice page; [benchmarking CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/CRAM.html) with information; on the effect of different CRAM options on file size and encoding/decoding; performance. Here are some basic file size and runtime numbers for running a single; `make_examples` job on a 30x whole genome sample in BAM and CRAM format. Filetype | Size (Gb) | Runtime (min); -------- | --------- | -------------; BAM | 66.99 | 79m47.37307s; CRAM | 37.85 | 96m53.477s; Ratio | 56.50% | 121.43%. * BAM file:; `gs://deepvariant/performance-testdata/HG002_NIST_150bp_downsampled_30x.bam`; * CRAM file:; `gs://deepvariant/performance-testdata/HG002_NIST_150bp_downsampled_30x.cram`. Runtime was measured on; [n1-standard-64](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#n1_machine_types); machines. ## Starting from v1.2.0, we include `samtools` and `bcftools`.

We will be using GRCh38 for this case study. ```bash; FTPDIR=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids. curl ${FTPDIR}/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz | gunzip > reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta; curl ${FTPDIR}/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.fai > reference/GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta.fai; ```. ### Download Genome in a Bottle Benchmarks. We will benchmark our variant calls against v4.2.1 of the Genome in a Bottle; small variant benchmarks for HG005. We will also restrict analysis to CDS; regions on chromosome 20 to make this demonstration quicker. The benchmarks consist of a bedfile containing confident regions, a VCF of; 'true' variants, and a VCF index. ```bash; FTPDIR=ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/ChineseTrio/HG005_NA24631_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38. curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.bed; curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz; curl -L ${FTPDIR}/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz.tbi > benchmark/HG005_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark.vcf.gz.tbi; ```. ### Download and extract a CDS bedfile. Next, we will download a [gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) gff3; annotation and extract a bed file of chr20 CDS regions. ```bash; curl -L https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_41/gencode.v41.basic.annotation.gff3.gz > data/gencode.v41.basic.annotation.gff3.gz. # Extract chr20 CDS regions and convert to bed file.; gzip -dc data/gencode.v41.basic.annotation.gff3.gz | \; awk -v OFS='\t' '$1 == ""chr20"" && $3

Since the DeepVariant v0.9 release, we recommend; ""[Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md)"". For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced; [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md); in v1.1. ## Why am I seeing ""CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error"" while running on GPU?. We have been observing the following message while running on GPU since we moved; platform from slim to keras:. ```bash; 2023-10-20 22:21:03.818638: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```. We; have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So; you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. ## How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models?. 16GB. In our test, we observe the model occupying 16GB GPU memory. ## Do models from before r1.6.0 work with current inference code?. No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in; Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. ## Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs?. No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU; inference yet. ## Can model_train be run on multiple GPUs?. No. TensorFlow's Estimator API does provide support for running training on; multiple GPUs through the use of a DistributionStrategy. However,; DistributionStrategy cannot be used with exponential moving average (EMA), which; is present in the DeepVariant codebase. ## What is the realigner and how does it work?. From the; [DeepVariant 2018 manuscript](",test,MatchSource.DOCS,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/v1.6.1/docs/FAQ.md:9225,tested,9225,docs/FAQ.md,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/v1.6.1/docs/FAQ.md,1,['test'],['tested'],"The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection.

Content: hat your home directory is first.; ls $HOME; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1""; sudo docker run \; -v ""${HOME}"":""${HOME}"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; ls $HOME; ```. ## How do I run multi-sample calling?. Since the DeepVariant v0.9 release, we recommend; ""[Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md)"". For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced; [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md); in v1.1. ## Why am I seeing ""CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error"" while running on GPU?. We have been observing the following message while running on GPU since we moved; platform from slim to keras:. ```bash; 2023-10-20 22:21:03.818638: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```. We; have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So; you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. ## How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models?. 16GB. In our test, we observe the model occupying 16GB GPU memory. ## Do models from before r1.6.0 work with current inference code?. No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in; Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. ## Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs?. No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU; inference yet. ## Can model_train be run on multiple GPUs?. No. TensorFlow's Estimator API does provide support for running training on; multiple GPUs through the use of a DistributionStrategy. However,; DistributionStrategy cannot be used with exponential moving average (EMA), which; is present in the DeepVariant codebase. ## What is the realigner and how does it work?. From the; [DeepVariant 2018 manuscript](

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: mats; (like SAM and VCF) designed for painless integration with the; [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning framework. Nucleus; was built with DeepVariant in mind and open-sourced separately so it can be used; by anyone in the genomics research community for other projects. See this blog; post on; [Using Nucleus and TensorFlow for DNA Sequencing Error Correction](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2019-01-31-using-nucleus-and-tensorflow-for-dna-sequencing-error-correction/). ## DeepVariant Setup. ### Prerequisites. * Unix-like operating system (cannot run on Windows); * Python 3.8. ### Official Solutions. Below are the official solutions provided by the; [Genomics team in Google Health](https://health.google/health-research/). Name | Description; :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | -----------; [Docker](docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md) | This is the recommended method.; [Build from source](docs/deepvariant-build-test.md) | DeepVariant comes with scripts to build it on Ubuntu 20.04. To build and run on other Unix-based systems, you will need to modify these scripts.; Prebuilt Binaries | Available at [`gs://deepvariant/`](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant). These are compiled to use SSE4 and AVX instructions, so you will need a CPU (such as Intel Sandy Bridge) that supports them. You can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file on your computer, which lists these features under ""flags"". ## Contribution Guidelines. Please [open a pull request](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/compare) if; you wish to contribute to DeepVariant. Note, we have not set up the; infrastructure to merge pull requests externally. If you agree, we will test and; submit the changes internally and mention your contributions in our; [release notes](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/releases).

Testability,"otify the user; of the error. ### `postprocess_variants`. When run in gVCF mode, the `postprocess_variants` program handles the creation; of the final gVCF file that incorporates both the non-variant records and the; true variants discovered by the previous programs. Two additional flags are required in `postprocess_variants`, the input; `--nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path <filename>` which corresponds to the TFRecord; of Variant protocol buffers created in `make_examples`, and the output; `--gvcf_outfile <filename>` which is the final gVCF output. A concrete example call, using variables defined in the [WGS case study] and in; the above `make_examples` example:. ```bash; OUTPUT_GVCF=""${OUTPUT_DIR}/HG002.output.g.vcf.gz"". ( time python ""${BIN_DIR}""/postprocess_variants.zip \; --ref ""${REF}"" \; --infile ""${CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT}"" \; --outfile ""${OUTPUT_VCF}"" \; --nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path ""${GVCF_TFRECORDS}"" \; --gvcf_outfile ""${OUTPUT_GVCF}""; ) >""${LOG_DIR}/postprocess_variants.log"" 2>&1; ```. ## Storage and runtime considerations. The number of non-variant records created when running DeepVariant in gVCF; depends highly on the sequencing depth of the input sample. This is because the; gVCF records at adjacent sites are merged when the genotype qualities are equal,; and we limit the possible genotype quality seen to be at most 50. For; deeply-sequenced individuals (e.g. 30-50x coverage), many sites hit the GQ=50; cap and are merged into few records. Samples with lower sequencing depth have; more sites within the dynamic range of the binomial model used to estimate; non-variant site genotype quality, and thus more records are created.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: otify the user; of the error. ### `postprocess_variants`. When run in gVCF mode, the `postprocess_variants` program handles the creation; of the final gVCF file that incorporates both the non-variant records and the; true variants discovered by the previous programs. Two additional flags are required in `postprocess_variants`, the input; `--nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path <filename>` which corresponds to the TFRecord; of Variant protocol buffers created in `make_examples`, and the output; `--gvcf_outfile <filename>` which is the final gVCF output. A concrete example call, using variables defined in the [WGS case study] and in; the above `make_examples` example:. ```bash; OUTPUT_GVCF=""${OUTPUT_DIR}/HG002.output.g.vcf.gz"". ( time python ""${BIN_DIR}""/postprocess_variants.zip \; --ref ""${REF}"" \; --infile ""${CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT}"" \; --outfile ""${OUTPUT_VCF}"" \; --nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path ""${GVCF_TFRECORDS}"" \; --gvcf_outfile ""${OUTPUT_GVCF}""; ) >""${LOG_DIR}/postprocess_variants.log"" 2>&1; ```. ## Storage and runtime considerations. The number of non-variant records created when running DeepVariant in gVCF; depends highly on the sequencing depth of the input sample. This is because the; gVCF records at adjacent sites are merged when the genotype qualities are equal,; and we limit the possible genotype quality seen to be at most 50. For; deeply-sequenced individuals (e.g. 30-50x coverage), many sites hit the GQ=50; cap and are merged into few records. Samples with lower sequencing depth have; more sites within the dynamic range of the binomial model used to estimate; non-variant site genotype quality, and thus more records are created. To mitigate this effect, the `make_examples` program has a flag; `--gvcf_gq_binsize <int>`. This flag allows the merging of adjacent records that; all have GQ values within a bin of the given size, and for each record emits the; minimum GQ value seen within the bin. For example, setting `--gvcf_gq_binsize 5` has the effect that adjacent

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: pecifying `--model_type ONT_R104`, you'll be using a model that is best; suited for Oxford Nanopore R10.4.1 chemistry Simplex and Duplex reads. NOTE: If you want to run each of the steps separately, add `--dry_run=true` to; the command above to figure out what flags you need in each step. Based on the; different model types, different flags are needed in the `make_examples` step. `--intermediate_results_dir` flag is optional. By specifying it, the; intermediate outputs of `make_examples` and `call_variants` stages can be found; in the directory. After the command, you can find these files in the directory:. ```; call_variants_output.tfrecord.gz; gvcf.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz; make_examples.tfrecord-?????-of-?????.gz; ```. ## Benchmark HG002 chr20 output from DeepVariant. We will use Genome-in-a-Bottle (GIAB) dataset to evaluate the performance of; DeepVariant. ### Download Genome in a Bottle Benchmarks.

Testability,"rio. ## Background. To get started, we've provided a Docker image, and some test data in a bucket on; Google Cloud Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data; through the corresponding public URLs. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepTrio in one command. Although DeepTrio can be built from a source, we provide a docker image that; allows to run through all steps in one command to generate VCF/gVCF output files; from input BAM files and the reference. If you want to compile the binaries for yourself, we also have a [Dockerfile]; that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the [docker build]; documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. For each sample, one aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its; corresponding index file (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a; sequencing instrument, using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs.

From our local; command line, we do:. ```shell; gcloud beta compute instances create ""${USER}-deepvariant-quickstart"" \; --scopes ""compute-rw,storage-full,cloud-platform"" \; --image-family ubuntu-2004-lts --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \; --machine-type n1-standard-8 \; --boot-disk-size=200GB \; --zone us-west1-b \; --accelerator type=nvidia-tesla-k80,count=1 --maintenance-policy TERMINATE --restart-on-failure; ```. NOTE: To create an instance *without GPU*, simply omit the last line from the; command. Check that the instance has been created and started:. ```shell; gcloud compute instances list; ```. which should produce output like:. ```; NAME ZONE MACHINE_TYPE PREEMPTIBLE INTERNAL_IP EXTERNAL_IP STATUS; [USER]-deepvariant-quickstart us-west1-b n1-standard-8 10.138.0.4 35.185.203.59 RUNNING; ```. Then connect to your instance via SSH:. ```shell

Content: # show_examples: Saving human-readable images from DeepVariant examples. This is a short guide to using the show_examples tool to view the pileup images; used within DeepVariant and save them as PNG image files. This tool is; particularly useful when you want to try to understand how a candidate variant; of interest was represented when it was passed into the neural network. ![An example pileup image](images/example_1.4.0.png). This example was generated with the data from the; [quick start guide](deepvariant-quick-start.md) and the example commands below. For more information on the pileup images and how to read them, please see the; [""Looking through DeepVariant's Eyes"" blog post](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2020-02-20-looking-through-deepvariants-eyes/). The `show_examples` tool is introduced in DeepVariant 1.0.0, so it is not; available in older versions, but it will work with make_examples output files; from older versions of DeepVariant. ## Finding the make_examples output tfrecord files. First, find the make_examples.tfrecord.gz files output by DeepVariant during the; make_examples (first) stage. If you followed along with the [quick start guide](deepvariant-quick-start.md); and case studies that used the Docker version, then these files are usually; hidden inside the Docker container.

The output of DeepTrio is a set of variants in; [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf) format representing the; child and one or two parents. Similar to DeepVariant, DeepTrio is composed of three stages: `make_examples`,; `call_variants`, and `postprocess_variants`. Some of the components (; `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`) are shared with DeepVariant, and; `make_examples` is specialized for DeepTrio. More details about each program are; described in detail in the; [Inputs and outputs](deepvariant-details.md#inputs-and-outputs) section of the; DeepVariant documentation. DeepTrio comes with three models for different types of input data:. * Illumina whole genome data (WGS).; * Illumina whole exome data (WES).; * PacBio HiFi whole genome data (PacBio WGS). ## Running DeepTrio. The easiest and recommended way to run DeepTrio is using; `google/deepvariant:deeptrio-latest` docker image. Please refer to the; [quick start guide](deeptrio-quick-start.md) for more details on how to run; DeepTrio using docker. Merging VCFs can be done using; [GLnexus](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus) which has been optimized for; use with DeepVariant gVCFs. The process is described in the DeepTrio case; studies; ([DeepTrio whole genome sequencing case study](deeptrio-wgs-case-study.md) and; [Using DeepTrio for small variant calling from the trio sequenced with PacBio; HiFi](deeptrio-pacbio-case-study.md)), and in the manuscript,; [""Accurate, scalable cohort variant calls using DeepVariant and GLnexus""](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.942086v2). Please note that DeepTrio can be run with a `run_deeptrio.py` script that; automates all DeepTrio steps and thus greatly simplifies the inference pipeline.; The details of using this script can be found in the section below as well as in; the DeepTrio case studies. Also please note: for the non-PAR regions of the sex chromosomes (X and Y), we; recommend

If needed, DeepTrio can be built from source. For more details please refer to; [Building DeeepTrio](deeptrio-build-test.md). ## DeepTrio Input assumptions. The reference genome FASTA, passed in using the `--ref` flag, must be indexed; and can either be uncompressed or compressed with `bgzip`. All BAM files should be aligned to a ""compatible"" version of the genome; reference provided as the `--ref`. DeepTrio will only process contigs shared by; both the BAM and reference. BAM files must be also sorted and indexed. They must; exist on disk, so you cannot pipe them into DeepTrio. Duplicate marking may be; performed. In our analyses, there is almost no difference in accuracy with and; without duplicate marking except at lower (<20x) coverages. Finally, we; recommend that you do not perform BQSR. Running BQSR has a small decrease on; accuracy. If you are providing `--regions` or other similar arguments, these should refer; to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21. ## Training data. DeepTrio models are trained using the latest publicly avavilable GIAB; benchmarks. You can find more details about the training data for each DeepTrio; model in the; [DeepTrio Training Data document](deeptrio-details-training-data.md). ## DeepVariant dependency.

A reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format); format and its corresponding; [.fai index file](http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html) generated using the; `samtools faidx` command. 1. An aligned reads file in [BAM](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) format; and its corresponding index file (.bai). The reads must be aligned to the; reference genome described above. 1. A model checkpoint for DeepVariant. The output of DeepVariant is a list of all variant calls in; [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf) format. DeepVariant is composed of three programs: `make_examples`, `call_variants`, and; `postprocess_variants`. More details about each program are described in detail; in the [Inputs and outputs](#inputs-and-outputs) section. ## Inputs and outputs. ### General notes. * Sharded files are a single logical collection of files with a common naming; convention. For example, we talk about `filename@10` as a single 10-way; sharded file named `filename`. On most filesystems this actually looks like; 10 distinct files `filename-00000-of-00010`, ..., `filename-00009-of-00010`.; DeepVariant can write sharded files using their `filename@10`-style name and; can read sharded files using both that style as well as the glob form, such; as `filename-*` or `filename-*-of-00010`.; * Files with the `.gz` suffix are interpreted as being compressed with gzip; and are read/written accordingly. ### make_examples. `make_examples` consumes reads and the reference genome to create TensorFlow; examples for evaluation with our deep learning models.
