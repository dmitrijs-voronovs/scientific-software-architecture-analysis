Phys. Chem. XXX This uses a “primary” virtual space 3s3p (RAS 2), a “secondary” virtual space 3d4s4p4d4f (RAS 3), and a “tertiary” virtual space consisting of the remaining virtuals. First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance. Next, the RASCI is run. The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3). If any electrons are present in the tertiary virtual subspace (RAS 4), then that excitation is only allowed if it is a single or double. dcft9; UHF-ODC-12 and RHF-ODC-12 single-point energy for H2O.

However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #!

The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10].

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals.

In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; 1>>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any ”.in” or ”.dat” extension by ”.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples.

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers. Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy with Psithon¶; Finally, let’s consider an example that shows how the Python driver; in PSI4 simplifies some routine tasks. PSI4 can interpret; valid Python code in addition to the computational chemistry directives; we’ve seen in the previous examples; we call this mixture Psithon.; The Python computer language is very easy to pick up, and even users; previously unfamiliar with Python can use it to simplify tasks by; modifying some of the example input files supplied with PSI4; in the psi4/samples directory.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different.

Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20# Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; unit",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/tutorial-1.html

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances.

In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that PSI4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree–Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with freeze_core True.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”.

A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; 1>>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any ”.in” or ”.dat” extension by ”.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory.

PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20# Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; unit",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/tutorial.html

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations.

After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!.

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge.

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20# Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; unit",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/tutorial.html

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available.

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]. So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]; [Hohenstein:2010:014101]. Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT,; we might as well also use it for the Hartree–Fock computations that are; performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that with; scf_type DF.; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that; pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, PSI4 is usually smart; enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given; computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that PSI4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree–Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with freeze_core True.

Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20# Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; 1>>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any ”.in” or ”.dat” extension by ”.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory. Running a Basic Hartree–Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree–Fock SCF computation; for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set.

If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; 1; 2; 3Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D\(_n\)) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as \({\cal O}(N^5)\). In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation.

In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D\(_n\)) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al.

In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as \({\cal O}(N^5)\). In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; The ADC code makes use of the libtrans library for efficient and flexible; integral-transformation and also the libdpd library to; utilize molecular symmetry in the tensorial manipulations in framework; of the direct-product decomposition algorithm.

It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed.

For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0.

Type: integer; Default: 0. CFOUR_SPHERICAL (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether spherical harmonic (5d, 7f, 9g, etc.) or Cartesian (6d, 10f, 15g, etc.) basis functions are to be used. ON (= 1) uses spherical harmonics, OFF (= 0) uses Cartesians. Psi4 Interface: Keyword set according to basis design when BASIS is used instead of CFOUR_BASIS. Keyword subject to translation from value of PUREAM unless set explicitly. Type: boolean; Default: true. CFOUR_SPIN_FLIP (CFOUR); CFOUR — Controls whether excitation energy calculations allow for a “spin flip” which changes the \(M_s\) quantum number. Such calculations have some advantages for biradicals and are currently implemented (together with gradients) for CIS and CIS(D) calculations. Options are OFF and ON. Type: boolean; Default: false.

CFOUR_SYM_CHECK (CFOUR); CFOUR — In principle can be used to force the SCF to converge a solution for which the density matrix transforms as the totally symmetric representation of the point group (i.e. no broken symmetry solutions). The code seems to work in most cases, but has currently been implemented for point groups with E type representation and not for those with triply-, quadruply- or pentuply-degenerate representations. Extending the code to those cases is probably straightforward, and the reader is encouraged to do so if (s)he is so inclined. SYM_CHECK=0 “forces” the high-symmetry solution. SYM_CHECK=OVERRIDE (=1) doesn’t. The latter is the default. Type: boolean; Default: true. CFOUR_SYMMETRY (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies what subgroup of the full point group is to be used in the energy and/or gradient calculation (the computational point group). OFF (=1) forces a no symmetry run (in \(C_1\) ) and ON (=0) runs the calculation in the largest self-adjoint subgroup ( \(D_{2h}\) and its subgroups). Type: boolean; Default: true. CFOUR_T3_EXTRAPOL (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether the T3 amplitudes are included ON (=1) or not included OFF (=0) in the DIIS convergence acceleration during CCSDT calculations.

If the default NO (=0) is specified then no frequencies are calculated. For ANALYTIC, vibrational frequencies are determined from analytically computed second derivatives, and for FINDIF (=2) vibrational frequencies are calculated from a force field obtained by numerical differentiation of analytically evaluated gradients (or even single-point energies) using symmetry-adapted mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates. If vibrational frequencies are calculated, a normal mode analysis using the computed force-constant matrix is performed, rotationally projected frequencies are computed, infrared intensities are determined, and zero-point energies (ZPE) are evaluated. Type: string; Possible Values: NO, ANALYTIC, FINDIF, EXACT; Default: NO. CFOUR_VTRAN (CFOUR); CFOUR — This keyword defines what type of integral transformation is to be performed in the program xvtran. FULL/PARTIAL (=0) allows the transformation program to choose the appropriate type of transformation, while FULL (=1) requires a full integral transformation and PARTIAL (=2) means a MBPT(2)-specific transformation where the \((ab \vert cd)\) integrals are not formed.

OFF (= 0) The relaxed density will not be computed, ON (= 1) it will be computed. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RES_RAMAN (CFOUR); CFOUR — This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates. A warning message is printed if the force constant matrix is unavailable. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RESTART_CC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Offers the possibility to restart a CC calculation which stopped for various reasons, e.g. time limit, in the correlation part. However, note that a restart which is specified by ON (= 1) needs the following files of the previous unfinished calculation: JOBARC, JAINDX, MOINTS, and MOABCD. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_ROT_EVEC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies which eigenvector of the orbital rotation Hessian is to be used to rotate the original SCF orbitals. By default, it will use that associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the totally symmetric part of the block-factored Hessian, as this choice often leads to the lowest energy SCF solution. For RHF stability checks, only those instabilities which correspond to RHF solutions will be considered.

A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates. A warning message is printed if the force constant matrix is unavailable. Type: boolean; Default: false.

If the reference function is for an open-shell system, two strings of NIRREP occupation numbers separated by a slash are input for the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) sets of orbitals. An example of the use of the OCCUPATION keyword for the water molecule would be OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0. For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed. (Default: The occupation is given by the core Hamiltonian initial guess). Psi4 Interface: The arrays above are specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,1,0] and [[3,1,1,0],[3,0,1,0]].

IJ_CANONICAL requests a canonical perturbed-orbital treatment only for the occupied-occupied block of the unperturbed density matrix in analytic derivative calculations. For testing purposes, it is possible to force the use standard perturbed orbitals even in case of iterative triple excitations via the option FORCE_STANDA (dne?).

For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF. Type: string; Possible Values: OFF, EXPECTATION, UNRELAXED, RESPONSE; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ESTATE_SYM (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the number of excited states which are to be determined in each irreducible representation of the computational subgroup. The program attempts to find all of the lowest roots, but this is not guaranteed because the eigenvalue problem is not solved by direct matrix diagonalization, but rather by an iterative (modified Davidson) algorithm. For excited state gradient calculations, only one root (clearly) is used. In such a case, one and only one non-zero entry in the string can be used, and this value is usually set to one (i.e. 0/1/0/0). (However sometimes one wants to calculate the gradient for, say, the second root of a given symmetry, and in such a case, one could use 0/2/0/0. What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in CFOUR_OCCUPATION. For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the %excite* input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros.

This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false.

The options are: OFF (=0) [no properties or transition moments are calculated]; EXPECTATION (=1) [transition moments and dipole strengths are calculated along with selected one-electron properties which are evaluated as expectation values]; UNRELAXED (=2) [selected one-electron properties are calculated in an approximation that neglects relaxation of molecular orbitals]; RESPONSE (=3) [selected one-electron properties are calculated as analytic first derivatives of the energy]. Except for EOMCC calculations on two-electron systems (which are exact), properties obtained by the three approaches will not be equivalent. The default value for this keyword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evalu",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html

For excited state gradient calculations, only one root (clearly) is used. In such a case, one and only one non-zero entry in the string can be used, and this value is usually set to one (i.e. 0/1/0/0). (However sometimes one wants to calculate the gradient for, say, the second root of a given symmetry, and in such a case, one could use 0/2/0/0. What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in CFOUR_OCCUPATION. For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the %excite* input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros. Psi4 Interface: The array above is specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,0,2]. Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ESTATE_TRANS (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether just the excitation energies (OFF, =0) or in addition transition moments (EXPECTATION, =1) are calculated. Note that this keyword should not be used in excited-state calculations involving analytic gradients and that transition moments are essentially only available for EOM-CCSD/CCSD-LR. Type: string; Possible Values: OFF, EXPECTATION; Default: OFF. CFOUR_EVAL_HESS (CFOUR); CFOUR — Tells the program, in the course of a geometry optimization, to calculate the Hessian explicitly every N cycles. 0 means never calculated explicitly. Psi4 Interface: Geometry optimizations run through PSI (except in sandwich mode) use PSI’s optimizer and so this keyword has no effect. Use optking keywords instead, particularly FULL_HESS_EVERY.

CFOUR_FD_CALCTYPE (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the algorithm used to compute the harmonic force constants in finite-difference calculations.GRADONLY (=0) evaluates the force constants and dipole moment derivatives by numerical differentiation of analytic gradients; ENERONLY (=1) evaluates the force constants by second differences of energies (dipole moment derivatives are not evaluated); while MIXED (=2) evaluates 1x1 blocks of symmetry-blocked force constants by second differences pf energies and all other elements by first differences of gradients. the GRADONLY and MIXED approaches may, of course, only be used hwen using computational methods for which analytic gradients are available.

CFOUR_FD_IRREPS (CFOUR); CFOUR — Requests that only vibrational frequencies of certain symmetry types are evaluated in a VIBRATION=FINDIF calculation. The numbers of the irreducible representations for which vibrational analysis is to be performed are separated by slashes. For example, FD_IRREP=1/3/4 means compute the frequencies of modes transforming as the first, third, and fourth irreducible representations. If a symmetry is specified for which there are no vibrational modes, the program will terminate. The labels of the irreducible representations for this keyword are not usually the same as those used in the rest of the calculation. Moreover, for some point groups, for example, those of linear molecules, the two sets of labels refer to different subgroups.

In the latter case, the threshold for deleting virtual orbitals based on the orbital energy needs to be specified in a %frozen_virt section. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_GAMMA_ABCD (CFOUR); CFOUR — Used to control the handling and storage of two-particle density matrix elements with four virtual indices \(\Gamma(abcd)\). DISK (=0) directs the program to calculate and store all elements of \(\Gamma(abcd)\), while DIRECT (=1) tells the program to use alternative algorithms in which \(\Gamma(abcd)\) is calculated and used “on the fly”. Note that this option might be not available for all type of calculations. Type: string; Possible Values: DISK, DIRECT; Default: DISK. CFOUR_GENBAS_1 (CFOUR); CFOUR — This keyword applies only to Hydrogen and Helium atoms and specifies the number of contracted Gaussian functions per shell. There is usually no need to use this keyword, but it can be useful for using a subset of the functions in a particular entry in the GENBAS file, particularly for generally contracted WMR basis sets. For example, if entry H:BASIS in the GENBAS file contains 7 contracted s functions, 4 p functions and a single d function, then setting GENBAS_1=730 would eliminate the last p function and the d function.
