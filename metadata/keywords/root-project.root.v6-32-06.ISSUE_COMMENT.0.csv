Usability,simpl,simply,"> Are now the partial files in the /tmp or equivalent directory? . Because the intermediary files could be large or numerous, if we rely on a shared directory we ought to create them in a user-specific subdirectory. However using a shared directory may cause problem in itself. On some system /tmp is small and /var/tmp should be used (or maybe simply use what TMPDIR says). All in all, it might even be better to use a (subdirectory of the) output directory which is, per se, guaranteed to be writeable by the user (or the output can not be done).

Performance,load,loads,"Hi @breitwieserCern ,; the functionality now looks good. Could you add a test in roottest about the new functionality?; This one should:; - Generate a dictionary with a selection xml; - Have a macro that loads it and checks that the custom streamer works fine; In order to achieve that, you can have a look to https://github.com/root-project/roottest/blob/master/root/meta/genreflex/CMakeLists.txt . Here you find the instructions about how to run tests: https://root.cern.ch/run-tests. In your case the CMake section could be something like:; ```. ROOTTEST_GENERATE_REFLEX_DICTIONARY(customStreamer customStreamer.h SELECTION customStreamer_selection.xml). ROOTTEST_ADD_TEST(customStreamer; MACRO customStreamer.C; OUTREF customStreamer.ref; DEPENDS ${GENERATE_REFLEX_TEST}); ```; This will generate the dictionary from *customStreamer.h* and *customStreamer_selection.xml*.

Usability,simpl,simplified,"Note that the original implementation is detailed in the documentation:; ```; /// and if not found; /// a direct try of libname will be made (in case it contained an; /// absolute path).; ```; Can you verify (by code inspection) if ```gSystem->DynamicPathName``` now return true for absolute path (even if it is not in the dynamic path)? . If so, I guess the function can indeed be simplified but the documentation needs to revise accordingly. The new code add 'GetPathInfo' and 'AccessPathName' calls to the path where DynamicPathName returned a positive answer. Can you verify that those check are not already done in DynamicPathName?

Usability,clear,clear,"To clear it up in detail. With the current implementation `v[idx]` is resolved to selecting the elements by the indices **only** if the idx is of type `RVec<size_t>`. In case it is implicitely casted, from `{0, 1, 2, ...}`, the type `RVec<size_t>` is the preferred type because it's an specific overload. See following examples:. ```cpp; using namespace ROOT::VecOps;; RVec<float> v = {1, 2, 3, 4};. // Take indices explicitely; // Select directly the overload operator[](const RVec<size_t>&); RVec<size_t> idx = {0, 1};; cout << v[idx] << endl;; // Returns: { 1, 2 }. // Take indices by implicit cast; // Resolves to RVec<size_t> because it's the ""strongest"" overload; cout << v[{0, 1}] << endl;; // Returns: { 1, 2 }. // Make selection; RVec<int> s1 = {1, 1, 0, 0};; cout << v[s1] << endl;; // Returns: { 1, 2 }; RVec<unsigned int> s2 = {1, 1, 0, 0};; cout << v[s2] << endl;; // Returns: { 1, 2 }; cout << v[v<3] << endl;; // Returns: { 1, 2 }; ```. @dpiparo @bluehood From my point of view, this is exactly the expected behaviour (TBD).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2621#issuecomment-421941066
Usability,clear,clear,"For me, this is not surprising. Imho, proper documentation could make the behaviour clear. and the case of implicit casting seems as well fine to me. noone will write `v[{0, 0, 1, 1}]` and expect a selection (?). Either doing this or breaking the API and inverting the behaviour? We can fix the selection type and let the index type float (but then with the unexpected implicit casting behaviour, which is bad). So this does not seem to be an option. Am I right that there's no other option to solve this in C++?. Last option could be dropping the feature and stick to `Take(v, idx)`, which is already there.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2621#issuecomment-421944127

Usability,simpl,simplification,"Hi @bluehood , we could indeed be even better than the STL, I agree. In my opinion here the root of all evil is the vector<bool> specialisation which is de facto a completely different class than vector<T> :( We are just paying the consequences of this asymmetry. Said that, let's dive in the things we can change :). I am hesitant to change the behaviour of data. Can there be cases where the instantiation of RVec<bool>(or vector<bool>)::data() takes place and then is not used, i.e. cases where it is better to be able to instantiate the method rather than not to?; The clean-up RAdoptAllocator can also be done: it is working though and it was not for free. In general I could imagine scenarios where it is better to be able to instantiate vector<bool, RAdoptAllocator<bool>> than not to be... but again this is has to be balanced against the overall simplification of the code base.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2804#issuecomment-430372940

Currently this test fails for runtime_cxxmodules even though the change seems unrelated. It seems to me that failure is the right behavior.

Modifiability,refactor,refactoring,"> I agree that we should use a ""proper"", existing option parsing library; I very much like that change! 50 lines less of our code is strictly better, hurray!; > ; > We should use that option parsing for all of ROOT's binaries. I'm extremely hesitant to select llvm's option parsing for that purpose: we want to hide llvm's symbols; only libCling and rootcling are able to access them. But that means we cannot use the same option parsing for all of ROOT - and we'll be back in an inconsistent state where everyone and their binary will roll their own. Using e.g. the head-only http://optionparser.sourceforge.net or https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts . root.exe argument parsing is a lot simpler (eg, we need to handle -l -b -q and hardly something more complex). The advantage of using `llvm::cl` in rootcling is that we can encapsulate the arguments in data structures which are compatible with cling. For instance, after rootcling parses the arguments it can call a future overload of `cling::Interpreter::Interpreter(llvm::cl...` where it will pass already the processed arguments. Currently we have to convert back to `const char **argv`. This would be a drawback if we use a library different than `llvm::cl`.

I'm extremely hesitant to select llvm's option parsing for that purpose: we want to hide llvm's symbols; only libCling and rootcling are able to access them.

The advantage of using `llvm::cl` in rootcling is that we can encapsulate the arguments in data structures which are compatible with cling.

Usability,clear,clearly,"Thanks for the comment @linev . I clearly see your point and I got to admit I was not thinking much about compatibility when I wrote this feature although this is a crucial point for a toolkit like ROOT. About the default value for the constructor everything is totally fine.; About the redefined virtual functions, I am not 100% sure what is the best way to resolve the problem. Probably providing a default value for the new parameter like I did for TAttMarker::SaveMarkerAttributes will not be enough.; I was asking myself whether it is better to overload the virtual function with the additional parameter or to define a complete new function with a different name. Maybe you can give me an advice on how to resolve this problem since am not fully familiar with the concept of virtual functions and the consequences of a particular implementation. All the best,; Simon Spies",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4721#issuecomment-571182962
Usability,simpl,simple,Sorry for this late comment. I had some other urgent matters to deal with.; My general comment is that the line width is not part of of the marker attributes. Seems to me markers attributes should remain simple. Some markers are also filled polygon. Would you like to apply the fill style to them ? I guess not. I guess the best way to implement what you need is to define new marker types. We are not limited in number. If you want a star with bigger line width we can ad a new marker type. Any way the useful line width is limited and surely smaller than 10.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4721#issuecomment-573575527
Usability,simpl,simple,"@Triple-S ; I see your points about posters. One simple way to bypass this issue is or course to use filled markers with seems to me are better any way. But I can understand you need hollow markers. As you may need only a few line widths may be 2, 3 and 4 simply adding new makers makes sense. Given the usually small size of markers, having any possible line widths does not make sense (you will rapidly get big ""blobs"" not understandable). So I am not sure a coding convention is necessary. The different look of the maker 3 should be fixed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4721#issuecomment-573597757

Deployability,patch,patch,"> * why does Linux seem to be ok?. See my previous reply (I will debug myself on Linux next week to give you the correct answer). > * why is `clustersInThisFileSize` zero as per Bertrand's last comment? that number should correspond to the TTree clusters in a given file, and should always be at least 1.

Integrability,depend,depend,"Hi @bellenot , first of all a couple clarifications:. * as per my EDIT2 above, the test is also broken on (at least some) linux platforms (for example, my own machine), but it doesn't run in the nightlies, weirdly.; * your explanation is about why `maxTasksPerFile` is zero. I was asking about `clustersInThisFileSize`, which does not depend on `GetImplicitMTPoolSize()`, but also turns out to be zero. As per my EDIT3 above, it's now clear that `clustersInThisFileSize` is zero because the input file for this test has zero clusters. That's a bit surprising, hence my original question and my request for a comment in the code of the test in EDIT3. Ok cool so #4947 and this PR are meant to fix this same issue. Which solution we want to adopt depends on whether `TTreeProcessorMT` usage, by design and (currently missing) docs, should always be preceeded by a call to `EnableImplicitMT` or not.

I looked a little bit in the code with the gdb and found out, where the application crashes. In `IncrementalCUDADeviceCompiler::generatePTX()` the line `llvm::Module* module = m_PTX_interp->getLastTransaction()->getModule();` returns a `nullptr`. But this only happens, if I define a Cuda `__global__` kernel. If use a normal C++ statement, like `int i = 3;` or define a Cuda `__device__` function everything is fine. I'm not sure, if there more cases. @vgvassilev Do you have an idea? Maybe you saw something, which can help me, during your porting work. If not, it is not problem. Then, I simply have to spent more time.; > ; > I found the problem and a possible fix. The problem happens in the Interpreter instance for the device code. In the function `IncrementalExecutor::runStaticInitializersOnce()`, there is the line `llvm::orc::VModuleKey K = emitModule(T.takeModule(), T.getCompilationOpts().OptLevel);`, which removes the `llvm::Module` from the transaction. Because `generatePTX()` is called afterwards, `getLastTransaction->getModule` returns a `nullptr`. At the moment, I don't know, why the device compiler creates a static initializer on the device site. On the host site, it is necessary to register the CUDA kernel. At the moment, my solution is a if-guard in `Interpreter::executeTransaction()`:; > ; > ```c++; > if(!m_Opts.CompilerOpts.CUDADevice); > ExeRes = m_Executor->runStaticInitializersOnce(T);; > ```; > ; > I need to verify, if this is a good solution.

Once you have identified a hidden friend overload you cannot spell it in a fully qualified way. Especially for operators we will have to switch to expression-based operator invocation (`a @ b`) rather than function-style invocation `operator@(a,b)`. As I said, that's what C++20 and later impose anyway. I will see that we implement the generic lookup you're after. I would still appreciate feedback on `op@` - I'd hate implementing something we cannot use in the end.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-697199710

Usability,clear,clear,"FUD? The new way of finding python in 6.20 required python-dev, breaking conda builds. The introduction of modules, not disabled by minimal, broke mac-debug and Windows builds. In the core libraries, new code appeared that casted pointer types to long, causing more Win64 breakage. Not that ROOT runs on Win64 at all and requires the exact same compiler on the user's end on Win32. Users can also not trivially switch C++ versions unless they rebuild from source, this on any platform. Several of these issues were also reported on the ROOT forum. What you are showing is that *you* are able to build ROOT on some carefully prepared machines with your carefully selected set of compilers. In that list of nightlies, you are not even building binaries on one machine and running them on others. Again, this is why I forked: you obviously have different goals in mind when you dismiss clear problems as ""FUD.""

Deployability,update,update,"Shipping PCMs is just another problem. For example, on Windows, MSVC likes to change header guards, so unless you use the _exact_ same compiler as ROOT was built with, you'll get a crash because of redefinitions. There are a couple of similar issues on Linux, which you ""fix"" by shipping Linux system headers (wchar.h, stat.h, time.h). But woe onto the poor bugger that has such headers significantly different from Scientific Linux on their system (e.g. Python's manylinux docker image ...). An no, Windows does _not_ have a system compiler. *You* selected one that works for you. Windows applications are quite binary compatible (more so than e.g. Mac, and certainly easier than Linux varietals), so that's a choice. Neither has Mac for that matter: folks are free to update Xcode or not. Of course, you're saved here b/c even older Clang on Mac is pretty up-to-date with C++, but no such luck on Windows. On the other hand, modern MSVC is fine, but then Clang5 underpinning Cling can not parse the C++ library headers of MSVC 19 with C++17 enabled. So catch-22.

That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them.

Usability,simpl,simple,"One way to go about this would be to mimic the suggested usage of the TFile the TTree is attached to as per the `TTree::ChangeFile` [docs](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTTree.html#a4680b0dfd17292acc29ba9a8f33788a3) in TBufferMerger. . One of the main limitations I see is that TBufferMerger is [hardwired](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/9822d0e2733cf802d8b2c3c7b6bc134296a171b8/io/io/src/TBufferMerger.cxx#L24-L43) to the initial TFile it is constructed with. Supposing we modify `TTree::ChangeFile` to check the tree is attached to a TBufferMergerFile, if it doesn't get deleted (like Philippe suggests in the gist comments) then we still have to find a way to change its name to not collide with the original one. If instead it still gets deleted then we have to create a new TBufferMergerFile and not a simple TFile, but we couldn't attach it to the TBufferMerger inside `TTree::ChangeFile`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6523#issuecomment-704257753

The class `TJSON` is indeed similar to the library of _nlohmann_ except a whole lot more lean (_nlohmann_ is 14,748 lines of code, while `TJSON` is 962 lines of code - as per `sloccount`). _nhlohmann_ tries to be very general and in fact expands upon the JSON standard, while `TJSON` tries to be as simple as possible. . Also, for `TJSON` I tried to do a bit of ROOT integration. For example, one can get arrays as `TArrayD` or `TArrayI` if possible, or one can assign from `TParameter<T>`. This is simple to make life a little easier for people. . That said, I have no particular preference for either.

Security,access,access,"Hi there,. OK, I think that I have found the culprit, but I don't understand the reasons. The main difference of our current 'minitree production' jobs this round is that we included a build of the MCFM physics generator with the build of our analysis code and we use it while running to calculate physics matrix elements for each event. . So to test this, I rebuilt our analysis code without building MCFM, and of course no longer calculate the matrix elements. I submitted this to the BNL site, and we read the files fine:.

The job continues fine, reading 6 files, as one would expect. Now there is no matrix element calculated before we start reading the events. So it must be that somehow linking in the MCFM libraries causes problems for calling the gethostname. I must admit that I have no idea how/why this would 'interfere', since MCFM is not run at all before the TFile::Open. . So I think that we can let this bug report rest for now. If anyone might have ideas on how to check or fix the MCFM problem, suggestions are welcome. But I no longer think that xrootd has a problem.

Such a transaction should, by design, not have any side effects. These leaks affect any PyROOT user and it would not surprise me if ROOT I/O is hit by this, too, given the double lookups everywhere, with and without `std::`, with one of the two regularly failing. As for your second point, that interface is broken on Windows 64b already and simply changing the return to `intptr_t` has a massive ripple effect, so if that platform is ever in the cards, you're going to have to deal with it anyway. Plus, a trivial augmentation would be to take a pointer to a value wrapper, which by default is `nullptr`. If given, return the value there, if not, keep the old behavior.

Performance,optimiz,optimization,"I actually remember trying `Evaluate` but it crashed. Didn't look into too many details as to why; it does have a couple of fewer ""protection pieces"" (such as the mutex lock) than does `Calc()`, so that may be the reason. But even then, I gave up on all that when I realized that Python readily outperforms. I mean, talk about optimization, even for your integer case and compare these two macro's:. ```; int noleak() {; int result = 0;; for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {; result += (int)TPython::Eval(""1+1"");; }; return result;; }; ```; and; ```; int leak() {; int result = 0;; for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {; result += (int)gInterpreter->Calc(""1+1"");; }; return result;; }; ```; Please note the constant: the `TPython::Eval()` is called _100x more_ than `TInterpreter::Calc()` and it is _still 4x faster_ on my box. So, my conclusion is that if you are in Cling and need to evaluate a run-time constructed expression represented in string-form, then the optimizily thing to do, is to call into Python ... (and if in a loop, then even if Python uses cppyy in turn, which uses Cling again, it will still outperform). And, of course, bonus points for not leaking ... There is one case where `cppyy` still fails: if the `operator+` in the expression above is a global `friend` (with the operands instances of some class), as so far, I've been unable to locate that method. So, I do still care, but my main problem is the leak on failed lookups, as those are very common. And I don't believe it is just the allocator, which as you tell it would re-use the memory, but I'll see first whether I can construct a pure Cling-only reproducer then. Aside, if/when the lookup helper is inverted (i.e. being able to tell what some _is_ rather than what it _isn't_), many of the failed lookups will simply go away.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7201#issuecomment-806058368

Availability,down,downside,"loop over 3 parallel histograms, you'd need the global to be a vector and you'd have to push_back() onto it, but you're in the same (bad) place then. I wrote a script just like that this week exactly to fit a number of peaks determined by a file read inside one routine, and looped over outside, and I used example 1, not example 2, and future use of the base routine will never cause leaks. . The code structure is problematic to me. RDirectory itself isn't terrible, but I just don't see what it solves other than more syntax to remember. A final point, the shared pointers supposedly perform worse than unique pointers. I don't know how much it matters, but when you're fitting millions of waveforms maybe it does. Of course then you shouldn't be using RDirectory, but you can still use my_subroutines.C to do your fit if you're looping the million without RDirectory or to examining one of those fits with RDirectory, without rewriting the routine. I'm going to skip the point about empty root objects just to limit the scope for now. ### How to skip globals entirely. Of course you can just let the top level code return an object or structure. The downside is just that you have to .L the code and call it with auto ret=make_th1(). It can't be a complied main(), but that's no big deal. It violates the spirit of ""scripting"" but is of course very clean:. example 3: ; ```cpp; //subroutine.C. // my_subroutines.C; void my_subroutine(unique_ptr<TH1> &x) {; x.reset(); // not needed for TH1F, but safer in general.; x.reset(new TH1F());; // .. do something with it.; }; ```; ```cpp; //make_th1.C. vector<unique_ptr<TH1>> make_th1() { //edit: changed to TH1's here; vector<unique_ptr<TH1>> retvec(3); // and here, as intended.; for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {; my_subroutine(retvec[i]);; }; return retvec;; }; ```.

Integrability,interface,interfaces,"> Thanks for your comments! . Thanks for the discussion. I think many students learn C++ from root examples so it matters.; ; Thanks for the link to the docs. I got a little confused about Heap().Create details when I looked at first (and there you go) but I get it now. I learned two things:. a) RDirectory can take an existing shared_ptr using Add() instead of Create(), super!; b) Little thing but it looks like Create() syntax cannot cast a TH1F to a TH1. I've learned to always want a TH1 and never a TH1F, as their interfaces are identical after construction (nothing sliced).

The PR as-is won't leak, but only because it's not flexible enough to create different things.

Safety,safe,safer,"; Thanks for the link to the docs. I got a little confused about Heap().Create details when I looked at first (and there you go) but I get it now. I learned two things:. a) RDirectory can take an existing shared_ptr using Add() instead of Create(), super!; b) Little thing but it looks like Create() syntax cannot cast a TH1F to a TH1. I've learned to always want a TH1 and never a TH1F, as their interfaces are identical after construction (nothing sliced). Implicit casts make it not a huge issue but I'd still prefer to cast to a TH1 smart pointer first and then use Add(), a trivial nuisance. Maybe Create has a way to cast that I'm missing, or could.

I like vanilla better, but I got a clean ownership model up until the end here, and made the globals right before exiting, almost like a return statement. If I want to put this in a compiled batch code that loops over this 50 times, pauses 1 second, and displays 3 things each time, I'd just add a loop with sleeps, and Bob's your uncle without even modifying the underlying implementation to get three instances. But this RDirectory version shown here and the C++ global version here are certainly not different in that respect. The C++ globals actually win on line count here if you like this code structure better (I do). I'd argue if one needs the extern header declarations to pass things around in compiled code, he should ask if he's doing it wrong, and that's not an usual sentiment. The whole point is I think to make things visible from the interpreter or other things spawned from it.

Usability,learn,learned,"I finally learned how to reproduce these kind of warnings with a new version of the LLVM tools. You need to make sure that the relevant ROOT subdirectory is compiled with `set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 1)` (it also helps to disable this for llvm-project to not get spammed by warnings from LLVM). For example, if you want to scan the `math` directory, you can do:; ```diff; diff --git a/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt b/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt; index 0b046717ba..b685291490 100644; --- a/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt; +++ b/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt; @@ -283,7 +283,7 @@ list(INSERT CMAKE_MODULE_PATH 0. # Generate a CompilationDatabase (compile_commands.json file) for our build,; # for use by clang_complete, YouCompleteMe, etc.; -set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 1); +set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 0). option(LLVM_INSTALL_BINUTILS_SYMLINKS; ""Install symlinks from the binutils tool names to the corresponding LLVM tools.""

So the warnings are easy to reproduce and we are aware that these exist for all for ROOT in general. Therefore, I'd suggest to close this particular issue so that we can focus on feature development and fixing confirmed bugs.

Usability,clear,clear,"This issue was brought up for discussion within the team. As things currently stand, the benefits of introducing the uppercase version of these function in the `VecOps` namespace is not clear. The decision is to close this issue for now, if more users will identify this as a blocker for their use cases then we can reassess the decision.
