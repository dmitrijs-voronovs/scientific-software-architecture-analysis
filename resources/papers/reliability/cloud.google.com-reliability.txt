The reliability pillar in the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides principles and recommendations to help you design, deploy, and manage
reliable workloads in Google Cloud.
This document is intended for cloud architects, developers, platform engineers,
administrators, and site reliability engineers.
Reliability
is a system's ability to consistently perform its intended
functions within the defined conditions and maintain uninterrupted service. Best
practices for reliability include redundancy, fault-tolerant design, monitoring,
and automated recovery processes.
As a part of reliability,
resilience
is the system's ability to withstand and
recover from failures or unexpected disruptions, while maintaining performance.
Google Cloud features, like
multi-regional deployments
,
automated backups, and disaster recovery solutions, can help you improve your
system's resilience.
Reliability is important to your cloud strategy for many reasons, including the
following:
Minimal downtime
: Downtime can lead to lost revenue, decreased
productivity, and damage to reputation. Resilient architectures can help
ensure that systems can continue to function during failures or recover
efficiently from failures.
Enhanced user experience
: Users expect seamless interactions with
technology. Resilient systems can help maintain consistent performance and
availability, and they provide reliable service even during high demand or
unexpected issues.
Data integrity
: Failures can cause data loss or data corruption.
Resilient systems implement mechanisms such as backups, redundancy, and
replication to protect data and ensure that it remains accurate and accessible.
Business continuity
: Your business relies on technology for critical
operations. Resilient architectures can help ensure continuity after a
catastrophic failure, which enables business functions to continue without
significant interruptions and supports a swift recovery.
Compliance
: Many industries have regulatory requirements for system
availability and data protection. Resilient architectures can help you to
meet these standards by ensuring systems remain operational and secure.
Lower long-term costs
: Resilient architectures require upfront
investment, but resiliency can help to reduce costs over time by preventing
expensive downtime, avoiding reactive fixes, and enabling more efficient
resource use.
Organizational mindset
To make your systems reliable, you need a plan and an established strategy.
This strategy must include education and the authority to prioritize reliability
alongside other initiatives.
Set a clear expectation that the entire organization is responsible for
reliability, including development, product management, operations, platform
engineering, and
site reliability engineering (SRE)
.
Even the business-focused groups, like marketing and sales, can influence
reliability.
Every team must understand the reliability targets and risks of their
applications. The teams must be accountable to these requirements. Conflicts
between reliability and regular product feature development must be prioritized
and escalated accordingly.
Plan and manage reliability holistically, across all your functions and teams.
Consider setting up a Cloud Centre of Excellence (CCoE) that includes a
reliability pillar. For more information, see
Optimize your organization's cloud journey with a Cloud Center of Excellence
.
Focus areas for reliability
The activities that you perform to design, deploy, and manage a reliable system
can be categorized in the following focus areas. Each of the reliability
principles and recommendations in this pillar is relevant to one of these focus
areas.
Scoping
: To understand your system, conduct a detailed analysis of
its architecture. You need to understand the components, how they work and
interact, how data and actions flow through the system, and what could go
wrong. Identify potential failures, bottlenecks, and risks, which helps you
to take actions to mitigate those issues.
Observation
: To help prevent system failures, implement
comprehensive and continuous observation and monitoring. Through this
observation, you can understand trends and identify potential problems
proactively.
Response
: To reduce the impact of failures, respond appropriately
and recover efficiently. Automated responses can also help reduce the
impact of failures. Even with planning and controls, failures can still occur.
Learning
: To help prevent failures from recurring, learn from each
experience, and take appropriate actions.
Core principles
The recommendations in the reliability pillar of the Well-Architected Framework are
mapped to the following core principles:
Define reliability based on user-experience goals
Set realistic targets for reliability
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
Take advantage of horizontal scalability
Detect potential failures by using observability
Design for graceful degradation
Perform testing for recovery from failures
Perform testing for recovery from data loss
Conduct thorough postmortems

Google Cloud, see

Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to plan, build, and manage resource redundancy, which
can help you to avoid failures.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
After you
decide the level of reliability
that you need, you must design your systems to avoid any
single points of failure
.
Every critical component in the system must be replicated across multiple
machines, zones, and
regions
.
For example, a critical database can't be located in only one region, and a
metadata server can't be deployed in only one single zone or region. In those
examples, if the sole zone or region has an outage, the system has a global
outage.
Recommendations
To build redundant systems, consider the recommendations in the following
subsections.
Identify failure domains and replicate services
Map out your system's
failure domains
,
from individual VMs to regions, and design for redundancy across the failure
domains.
To ensure high availability, distribute and replicate your services and
applications across multiple zones and regions. Configure the system for
automatic failover to make sure that the services and applications continue to
be available in the event of zone or region outages.
For examples of multi-zone and multi-region architectures, see
Design reliable infrastructure for your workloads in Google Cloud
.
Detect and address issues promptly
Continuously track the status of your failure domains to detect and address
issues promptly.
You can monitor the current status of Google Cloud services in all regions
by using the
Google Cloud Service Health dashboard
.
You can also view incidents relevant to your project by using
Personalized Service Health
.
You can use load balancers to detect resource health and automatically route
traffic to healthy backends. For more information, see
Health checks overview
.
Test failover scenarios
Like a fire drill, regularly simulate failures to validate the effectiveness of
your replication and failover strategies.
For more information, see
Simulate a zone outage for a regional MIG
and
Simulate a zone failure in GKE regional clusters
.

Set realistic targets for reliability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you define reliability goals that are technically feasible for your
workloads in Google Cloud.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Design your systems to be just reliable enough for user happiness. It might
seem counterintuitive, but a goal of 100% reliability is often not the most
effective strategy. Higher reliability might result in a significantly higher
cost, both in terms of financial investment and potential limitations on
innovation. If users are already happy with the current level of service, then
efforts to further increase happiness might yield a low return on investment.
Instead, you can better spend resources elsewhere.
You need to determine the level of reliability at which your users are happy,
and determine the point where the cost of incremental improvements begin to
outweigh the benefits. When you determine this level of
sufficient
reliability
, you can allocate resources strategically and focus on features and
improvements that deliver greater value to your users.
Recommendations
To set realistic reliability targets, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Accept some failure and prioritize components
Aim for high availability such as 99.99% uptime, but don't set a target of 100%
uptime. Acknowledge that some failures are inevitable.
The gap between 100% uptime and a 99.99% target is the allowance for failure.
This gap is often called the
error budget
. The error budget can help you take
risks and innovate, which is fundamental to any business to stay competitive.
Prioritize the reliability of the most critical components in the system.
Accept that less critical components can have a higher tolerance for failure.
Balance reliability and cost
To determine the optimal reliability level for your system, conduct thorough
cost-benefit analyses.
Consider factors like system requirements, the consequences of failures, and
your organization's risk tolerance for the specific application. Remember to
consider your
disaster recovery metrics
,
such as the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).
Decide what level of reliability is acceptable within the budget and other
constraints.
Look for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs without compromising
essential reliability features.

Set realistic targets for reliability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you define reliability goals that are technically feasible for your
workloads in Google Cloud.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Design your systems to be just reliable enough for user happiness. It might
seem counterintuitive, but a goal of 100% reliability is often not the most
effective strategy. Higher reliability might result in a significantly higher
cost, both in terms of financial investment and potential limitations on
innovation. If users are already happy with the current level of service, then
efforts to further increase happiness might yield a low return on investment.
Instead, you can better spend resources elsewhere.
You need to determine the level of reliability at which your users are happy,
and determine the point where the cost of incremental improvements begin to
outweigh the benefits. When you determine this level of
sufficient
reliability
, you can allocate resources strategically and focus on features and
improvements that deliver greater value to your users.
Recommendations
To set realistic reliability targets, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Accept some failure and prioritize components
Aim for high availability such as 99.99% uptime, but don't set a target of 100%
uptime. Acknowledge that some failures are inevitable.
The gap between 100% uptime and a 99.99% target is the allowance for failure.
This gap is often called the
error budget
. The error budget can help you take
risks and innovate, which is fundamental to any business to stay competitive.
Prioritize the reliability of the most critical components in the system.
Accept that less critical components can have a higher tolerance for failure.
Balance reliability and cost
To determine the optimal reliability level for your system, conduct thorough
cost-benefit analyses.
Consider factors like system requirements, the consequences of failures, and
your organization's risk tolerance for the specific application. Remember to
consider your
disaster recovery metrics
,
such as the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).
Decide what level of reliability is acceptable within the budget and other
constraints.
Look for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs without compromising
essential reliability features.

Conduct thorough postmortems
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you conduct effective postmortems after
failures and incidents.
This principle is relevant to the
learning
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
A postmortem is a written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken
to mitigate or resolve the incident, the root causes, and the follow-up actions
to prevent the incident from recurring. The goal of a postmortem is to learn
from mistakes and not assign blame.
The following diagram shows the workflow of a postmortem:
The workflow of a postmortem includes the following steps:
Create postmortem
Capture the facts
Identify and analyze the root causes
Plan for the future
Execute the plan
Conduct postmortem analyses after major events and non-major events like the
following:
User-visible downtimes or degradations beyond a certain threshold.
Data losses of any kind.
Interventions from on-call engineers, such as a release rollback or
rerouting of traffic.
Resolution times above a defined threshold.
Monitoring failures, which usually imply manual incident discovery.
Recommendations
Define postmortem criteria before an incident occurs so that everyone knows
when a post mortem is necessary.
To conduct effective postmortems, consider the recommendations in the following
subsections.
Conduct blameless postmortems
Effective postmortems focus on processes, tools, and technologies, and don't
place blame on individuals or teams. The purpose of a postmortem analysis is to
improve your technology and future, not to find who is guilty. Everyone makes
mistakes. The goal should be to analyze the mistakes and learn from them.
The following examples show the difference between feedback that assigns blame
and blameless feedback:
Feedback that assigns blame
: "We need to rewrite the entire
complicated backend system! It's been breaking weekly for the last three
quarters and I'm sure we're all tired of fixing things piecemeal.
Seriously, if I get paged one more time I'll rewrite it myself…"
Blameless feedback
: "An action item to rewrite the entire backend
system might actually prevent these pages from continuing to happen. The
maintenance manual for this version is quite long and really difficult to
be fully trained up on. I'm sure our future on-call engineers will thank us!"
Make the postmortem report readable by all the intended audiences
For each piece of information that you plan to include in the report, assess
whether that information is important and necessary to help the audience
understand what happened. You can move supplementary data and explanations to an
appendix of the report. Reviewers who need more information can request it.
Avoid complex or over-engineered solutions
Before you start to explore solutions for a problem, evaluate the importance of
the problem and the likelihood of a recurrence. Adding complexity to the system
to solve problems that are unlikely to occur again can lead to increased
instability.
Share the postmortem as widely as possible
To ensure that issues don't remain unresolved, publish the outcome of the
postmortem to a wide audience and get support from management. The value of a
postmortem is proportional to the learning that occurs after the postmortem.
When more people learn from incidents, the likelihood of similar failures
recurring is reduced.

Define reliability based on user-experience goals
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you to assess your users' experience, and then map the findings to
reliability goals and metrics.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Observability tools provide large amounts of data, but not all of the data
directly relates to the impacts on the users. For example, you might observe
high CPU usage, slow server operations, or even crashed tasks. However, if these
issues don't affect the user experience, then they don't constitute an outage.
To measure the user experience, you need to distinguish between internal system
behavior and user-facing problems. Focus on metrics like the success ratio of
user requests. Don't rely solely on server-centric metrics, like CPU usage,
which can lead to misleading conclusions about your service's reliability. True
reliability means that users can consistently and effectively use your
application or service.
Recommendations
To help you measure user experience effectively, consider the recommendations
in the following sections.
Measure user experience
To truly understand your service's reliability, prioritize metrics that reflect
your users' actual experience. For example, measure the users' query success
ratio, application latency, and error rates.
Ideally, collect this data directly from the user's device or browser. If this
direct data collection isn't feasible, shift your measurement point
progressively further away from the user in the system. For example, you can use
the load balancer or frontend service as the measurement point. This approach
helps you identify and address issues before those issues can significantly
impact your users.
Analyze user journeys
To understand how users interact with your system, you can use tracing tools
like
Cloud Trace
.
By following a user's journey through your application, you can find bottlenecks
and latency issues that might degrade the user's experience. Cloud Trace
captures detailed performance data for each
hop
in your service architecture.
This data helps you identify and address performance issues more efficiently,
which can lead to a more reliable and satisfying user experience.

Set realistic targets for reliability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you define reliability goals that are technically feasible for your
workloads in Google Cloud.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Design your systems to be just reliable enough for user happiness. It might
seem counterintuitive, but a goal of 100% reliability is often not the most
effective strategy. Higher reliability might result in a significantly higher
cost, both in terms of financial investment and potential limitations on
innovation. If users are already happy with the current level of service, then
efforts to further increase happiness might yield a low return on investment.
Instead, you can better spend resources elsewhere.
You need to determine the level of reliability at which your users are happy,
and determine the point where the cost of incremental improvements begin to
outweigh the benefits. When you determine this level of
sufficient
reliability
, you can allocate resources strategically and focus on features and
improvements that deliver greater value to your users.
Recommendations
To set realistic reliability targets, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Accept some failure and prioritize components
Aim for high availability such as 99.99% uptime, but don't set a target of 100%
uptime. Acknowledge that some failures are inevitable.
The gap between 100% uptime and a 99.99% target is the allowance for failure.
This gap is often called the
error budget
. The error budget can help you take
risks and innovate, which is fundamental to any business to stay competitive.
Prioritize the reliability of the most critical components in the system.
Accept that less critical components can have a higher tolerance for failure.
Balance reliability and cost
To determine the optimal reliability level for your system, conduct thorough
cost-benefit analyses.
Consider factors like system requirements, the consequences of failures, and
your organization's risk tolerance for the specific application. Remember to
consider your
disaster recovery metrics
,
such as the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).
Decide what level of reliability is acceptable within the budget and other
constraints.
Look for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs without compromising
essential reliability features.

Design for graceful degradation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you to design your Google Cloud workloads
to fail gracefully.
This principle is relevant to the
response
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Graceful degradation is a design approach where a system that experiences a
high load continues to function, possibly with reduced performance or accuracy.
Graceful degradation ensures continued availability of the system and prevents
complete failure, even if the system's work isn't optimal. When the load returns
to a manageable level, the system resumes full functionality.
For example, during periods of high load, Google Search prioritizes results
from higher-ranked web pages, potentially sacrificing some accuracy. When the
load decreases, Google Search recomputes the search results.
Recommendations
To design your systems for graceful degradation, consider the recommendations
in the following subsections.
Implement throttling
Ensure that your replicas can independently handle overloads and can throttle
incoming requests during high-traffic scenarios. This approach helps you to
prevent cascading failures that are caused by shifts in excess traffic between
zones.
Use tools like
Apigee
to control the rate of API requests during high-traffic times. You can configure
policy rules to reflect how you want to scale back requests.
Drop excess requests early
Configure your systems to drop excess requests at the frontend layer to protect
backend components. Dropping some requests prevents global failures and enables
the system to recover more gracefully.With this approach, some users might
experience errors. However, you can minimize the impact of outages, in contrast
to an approach like
circuit-breaking
, where
all
traffic is dropped during an
overload.
Handle partial errors and retries
Build your applications to handle partial errors and retries seamlessly. This
design helps to ensure that as much traffic as possible is served during
high-load scenarios.
Test overload scenarios
To validate that the throttle and request-drop mechanisms work effectively,
regularly simulate overload conditions in your system. Testing helps ensure that
your system is prepared for real-world traffic surges.
Monitor traffic spikes
Use analytics and monitoring tools to predict and respond to traffic surges
before they escalate into overloads. Early detection and response can help
maintain service availability during high-demand periods.

Take advantage of horizontal scalability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you use horizontal scalability. By using
horizontal scalability, you can help ensure that your workloads in
Google Cloud can scale efficiently and maintain performance.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Re-architect your system to a horizontal architecture. To accommodate growth in
traffic or data, you can add more resources. You can also remove resources when
they're not in use.
To understand the value of horizontal scaling, consider the limitations of
vertical scaling.
A common scenario for vertical scaling is to use a MySQL database as the
primary database with critical data. As database usage increases, more RAM and
CPU is required. Eventually, the database reaches the memory limit on the host
machine, and needs to be upgraded. This process might need to be repeated
several times. The problem is that there are hard limits on how much a database
can grow. VM sizes are not unlimited. The database can reach a point when it's
no longer possible to add more resources.
Even if resources were unlimited, a large VM can become a single point of
failure. Any problem with the primary database VM can cause error responses or
cause a system-wide outage that affects all users. Avoid single points of
failure, as described in
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
.
Besides these scaling limits, vertical scaling tends to be more expensive. The
cost can increase exponentially as machines with greater amounts of compute
power and memory are acquired.
Horizontal scaling, by contrast, can cost less. The potential for horizontal
scaling is virtually unlimited in a system that's designed to scale.
Recommendations
To transition from a single VM architecture to a horizontal multiple-machine
architecture, you need to plan carefully and use the right tools. To help you
achieve horizontal scaling, consider the recommendations in the following
subsections.
Use managed services
Managed services remove the need to manually manage horizontal scaling. For
example, with Compute Engine managed instance groups (MIGs), you can add or
remove VMs to scale your application horizontally. For containerized
applications, Cloud Run is a serverless platform that can automatically
scale your stateless containers based on incoming traffic.
Promote modular design
Modular components and clear interfaces help you scale individual components as
needed, instead of scaling the entire application. For more information, see
Promote modular design
in the performance optimization pillar.
Implement a stateless design
Design applications to be stateless, meaning no locally stored data. This lets
you add or remove instances without worrying about data consistency.

The reliability pillar in the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides principles and recommendations to help you design, deploy, and manage
reliable workloads in Google Cloud.
This document is intended for cloud architects, developers, platform engineers,
administrators, and site reliability engineers.
Reliability
is a system's ability to consistently perform its intended
functions within the defined conditions and maintain uninterrupted service. Best
practices for reliability include redundancy, fault-tolerant design, monitoring,
and automated recovery processes.
As a part of reliability,
resilience
is the system's ability to withstand and
recover from failures or unexpected disruptions, while maintaining performance.
Google Cloud features, like
multi-regional deployments
,
automated backups, and disaster recovery solutions, can help you improve your
system's resilience.
Reliability is important to your cloud strategy for many reasons, including the
following:
Minimal downtime
: Downtime can lead to lost revenue, decreased
productivity, and damage to reputation. Resilient architectures can help
ensure that systems can continue to function during failures or recover
efficiently from failures.
Enhanced user experience
: Users expect seamless interactions with
technology. Resilient systems can help maintain consistent performance and
availability, and they provide reliable service even during high demand or
unexpected issues.
Data integrity
: Failures can cause data loss or data corruption.
Resilient systems implement mechanisms such as backups, redundancy, and
replication to protect data and ensure that it remains accurate and accessible.
Business continuity
: Your business relies on technology for critical
operations. Resilient architectures can help ensure continuity after a
catastrophic failure, which enables business functions to continue without
significant interruptions and supports a swift recovery.
Compliance
: Many industries have regulatory requirements for system
availability and data protection. Resilient architectures can help you to
meet these standards by ensuring systems remain operational and secure.
Lower long-term costs
: Resilient architectures require upfront
investment, but resiliency can help to reduce costs over time by preventing
expensive downtime, avoiding reactive fixes, and enabling more efficient
resource use.
Organizational mindset
To make your systems reliable, you need a plan and an established strategy.
This strategy must include education and the authority to prioritize reliability
alongside other initiatives.
Set a clear expectation that the entire organization is responsible for
reliability, including development, product management, operations, platform
engineering, and
site reliability engineering (SRE)
.
Even the business-focused groups, like marketing and sales, can influence
reliability.
Every team must understand the reliability targets and risks of their
applications. The teams must be accountable to these requirements. Conflicts
between reliability and regular product feature development must be prioritized
and escalated accordingly.
Plan and manage reliability holistically, across all your functions and teams.
Consider setting up a Cloud Centre of Excellence (CCoE) that includes a
reliability pillar. For more information, see
Optimize your organization's cloud journey with a Cloud Center of Excellence
.
Focus areas for reliability
The activities that you perform to design, deploy, and manage a reliable system
can be categorized in the following focus areas. Each of the reliability
principles and recommendations in this pillar is relevant to one of these focus
areas.
Scoping
: To understand your system, conduct a detailed analysis of
its architecture. You need to understand the components, how they work and
interact, how data and actions flow through the system, and what could go
wrong. Identify potential failures, bottlenecks, and risks, which helps you
to take actions to mitigate those issues.
Observation
: To help prevent system failures, implement
comprehensive and continuous observation and monitoring. Through this
observation, you can understand trends and identify potential problems
proactively.
Response
: To reduce the impact of failures, respond appropriately
and recover efficiently. Automated responses can also help reduce the
impact of failures. Even with planning and controls, failures can still occur.
Learning
: To help prevent failures from recurring, learn from each
experience, and take appropriate actions.
Core principles
The recommendations in the reliability pillar of the Well-Architected Framework are
mapped to the following core principles:
Define reliability based on user-experience goals
Set realistic targets for reliability
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
Take advantage of horizontal scalability
Detect potential failures by using observability
Design for graceful degradation
Perform testing for recovery from failures
Perform testing for recovery from data loss
Conduct thorough postmortems

Google Cloud, see

Detect potential failures by using observability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you proactively identify areas where errors and
failures might occur.
This principle is relevant to the
observation
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
To maintain and improve the reliability of your workloads in
Google Cloud, you need to implement effective observability by using
metrics, logs, and traces.
Metrics are numerical measurements of activities that you want to track
for your application at specific time intervals. For example, you might
want to track technical metrics like request rate and error rate, which can
be used as service-level indicators (SLIs). You might also need to track
application-specific business metrics like orders placed and payments received.
Logs are time-stamped records of discrete events that occur within an
application or system. The event could be a failure, an error, or a change
in state. Logs might include metrics, and you can also use logs for SLIs.
A trace represents the journey of a single user or transaction through a
number of separate applications or the components of an application. For
example, these components could be microservices. Traces help you to track
what components were used in the journeys, where bottlenecks exist, and how
long the journeys took.
Metrics, logs, and traces help you monitor your system continuously.
Comprehensive monitoring helps you find out where and why errors occurred. You
can also detect potential failures before errors occur.
Recommendations
To detect potential failures efficiently, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Gain comprehensive insights
To track key metrics like response times and error rates, use
Cloud Monitoring
and
Cloud Logging
.
These tools also help you to ensure that the metrics consistently meet the needs
of your workload.
To make data-driven decisions, analyze default service metrics to understand
component dependencies and their impact on overall workload performance.
To customize your monitoring strategy, create and publish your own metrics by
using the Google Cloud SDK.
Perform proactive troubleshooting
Implement robust error handling and enable logging across all of the components
of your workloads in Google Cloud. Activate logs like
Cloud Storage access logs
and
VPC Flow Logs
.
When you configure logging, consider the associated
costs
.
To control logging costs, you can configure
exclusion filters
on the log sinks to exclude certain logs from being stored.
Optimize resource utilization
Monitor CPU consumption, network I/O metrics, and disk I/O metrics to detect
under-provisioned and over-provisioned resources in services like
GKE, Compute Engine, and Dataproc. For a
complete list of supported services, see
Cloud Monitoring overview
.
Prioritize alerts
For alerts, focus on critical metrics, set appropriate thresholds to minimize
alert fatigue, and ensure timely responses to significant issues. This targeted
approach lets you proactively maintain workload reliability. For more
information, see
Alerting overview
.

Perform testing for recovery from data loss
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you design and run tests for recovery from data
loss.
This principle is relevant to the
learning
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
To ensure that your system can recover from situations where data is lost or
corrupted, you need to run tests for those scenarios. Instances of data loss
might be caused by a software bug or some type of natural disaster. After such
events, you need to restore data from backups and bring all of the services back
up again by using the freshly restored data.
We recommend that you use three criteria to judge the success or failure of this
type of recovery test: data integrity, recovery time objective (RTO), and
recovery point objective (RPO). For details about the RTO and RPO metrics, see
Basics of DR planning
.
The goal of data restoration testing is to periodically verify that your
organization can continue to meet business continuity requirements. Besides
measuring RTO and RPO, a data restoration test must include testing of the
entire application stack and all the critical infrastructure services with the
restored data. This is necessary to confirm that the entire deployed application
works correctly in the test environment.
Recommendations
When you design and run tests for recovering from data loss, consider the
recommendations in the following subsections.
Verify backup consistency and test restoration processes
You need to verify that your backups contain consistent and usable snapshots of
data that you can restore to immediately bring applications back into service.
To validate data integrity, set up automated consistency checks to run after
each backup.
To test backups, restore them in a non-production environment. To ensure your
backups can be restored efficiently and that the restored data meets application
requirements, regularly simulate data recovery scenarios. Document the steps for
data restoration, and train your teams to execute the steps effectively during a
failure.
Schedule regular and frequent backups
To minimize data loss during restoration and to meet RPO targets, it's
essential to have regularly scheduled backups. Establish a backup frequency that
aligns with your RPO. For example, if your RPO is 15 minutes, schedule backups
to run at least every 15 minutes. Optimize the backup intervals to reduce the
risk of data loss.
Use Google Cloud tools like Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL
automated backups, or Spanner backups to schedule and manage backups.
For critical applications, use near-continuous backup solutions like
point-in-time recovery (PITR) for Cloud SQL
or incremental backups for large datasets.
Define and monitor RPO
Set a clear RPO based on your business needs, and monitor adherence to the RPO.
If backup intervals exceed the defined RPO, use Cloud Monitoring to set up
alerts.
Monitor backup health
Use
Google Cloud Backup and DR service
or similar tools to track the health of your backups and confirm that they are
stored in secure and reliable locations. Ensure that the backups are replicated
across multiple
regions
for added resilience.
Plan for scenarios beyond backup
Combine backups with disaster recovery strategies like active-active failover
setups or cross-region replication for improved recovery time in extreme cases.
For more information, see
Disaster recovery planning guide

Perform testing for recovery from failures
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you design and run tests for recovery in the
event of failures.
This principle is relevant to the
learning
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
To be sure that your system can recover from failures, you must periodically
run tests that include regional failovers, release rollbacks, and data
restoration from backups.
This testing helps you to practice responses to events that pose major risks to
reliability, such as the outage of an entire
region
.
This testing also helps you verify that your system behaves as intended during a
disruption.
In the unlikely event of an entire region going down, you need to fail over all
traffic to another region. During normal operation of your workload, when data
is modified, it needs to be synchronized from the primary region to the failover
region. You need to verify that the replicated data is always very recent, so
that users don't experience data loss or session breakage. The load balancing
system must also be able to shift traffic to the failover region at any time
without service interruptions. To minimize downtime after a regional outage,
operations engineers also need to be able to manually and efficiently shift user
traffic away from a region, in as less time as possible. This operation is
sometimes called
draining a region
, which means you stop the inbound traffic
to the region and move all the traffic elsewhere.
Recommendations
When you design and run tests for failure recovery, consider the
recommendations in the following subsections.
Define the testing objectives and scope
Clearly define what you want to achieve from the testing. For example, your
objectives can include the following:
Validate the recovery time objective (RTO) and the recovery point
objective (RPO). For details, see
Basics of DR planning
.
Assess system resilience and fault tolerance under various failure
scenarios.
Test the effectiveness of automated failover mechanisms.
Decide which components, services, or regions are in the testing scope. The
scope can include specific application tiers like the frontend, backend, and
database, or it can include specific Google Cloud resources like
Cloud SQL instances or GKE clusters. The scope must also specify any
external dependencies, such as third-party APIs or cloud interconnections.
Prepare the environment for testing
Choose an appropriate environment, preferably a staging or sandbox environment
that replicates your production setup. If you conduct the test in production,
ensure that you have safety measures ready, like automated monitoring and manual
rollback procedures.
Create a backup plan. Take snapshots or backups of critical databases and
services to prevent data loss during the test. Ensure that your team is prepared
to do manual interventions if the automated failover mechanisms fail.
To prevent test disruptions, ensure that your IAM roles,
policies, and failover configurations are correctly set up. Verify that the
necessary permissions are in place for the test tools and scripts.
Inform stakeholders, including operations, DevOps, and application owners,
about the test schedule, scope, and potential impact. Provide stakeholders with
an estimated timeline and the expected behaviors during the test.
Simulate failure scenarios
Plan and execute failures by using tools like
Chaos Monkey
.
You can use custom scripts to simulate failures of critical services such as a
shutdown of a primary node in a multi-zone GKE cluster or a disabled
Cloud SQL instance. You can also use scripts to simulate a region-wide
network outage by using firewall rules or API restrictions based on your scope
of test. Gradually escalate the failure scenarios to observe system behavior
under various conditions.
Introduce load testing alongside failure scenarios to replicate real-world
usage during outages. Test cascading failure impacts, such as how frontend
systems behave when backend services are unavailable.
To validate configuration changes and to assess the system's resilience against
human errors, test scenarios that involve misconfigurations. For example, run
tests with incorrect DNS failover settings or incorrect IAM
permissions.
Monitor system behavior
Monitor how load balancers, health checks, and other mechanisms reroute
traffic. Use Google Cloud tools like Cloud Monitoring and
Cloud Logging to capture metrics and events during the test.
Observe changes in latency, error rates, and throughput during and after the
failure simulation, and monitor the overall performance impact. Identify any
degradation or inconsistencies in the user experience.
Ensure that logs are generated and alerts are triggered for key events, such as
service outages or failovers. Use this data to verify the effectiveness of your
alerting and incident response systems.
Verify recovery against your RTO and RPO
Measure how long it takes for the system to resume normal operations after a
failure, and then compare this data with the defined RTO and document any
gaps.
Ensure that data integrity and availability align with the RPO. To test
database consistency, compare snapshots or backups of the database before and
after a failure.
Evaluate service restoration and confirm that all services are restored to a
functional state with minimal user disruption.
Document and analyze results
Document each test step, failure scenario, and corresponding system behavior.
Include timestamps, logs, and metrics for detailed analyses.
Highlight bottlenecks, single points of failure, or unexpected behaviors
observed during the test. To help prioritize fixes, categorize issues by
severity and impact.
Suggest improvements to the system architecture, failover mechanisms, or
monitoring setups. Based on test findings, update any relevant failover policies
and playbooks. Present a postmortem report to stakeholders. The report should
summarize the outcomes, lessons learned, and next steps. For more information,
see
Conduct thorough postmortems
.
Iterate and improve
To validate ongoing reliability and resilience, plan periodic testing (for
example, quarterly).
Run tests under different scenarios, including infrastructure changes, software
updates, and increased traffic loads.
Automate failover tests by using CI/CD pipelines to integrate reliability
testing into your development lifecycle.
During the postmortem, use feedback from stakeholders and end users to improve
the test process and system resilience.

The reliability pillar in the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides principles and recommendations to help you design, deploy, and manage
reliable workloads in Google Cloud.
This document is intended for cloud architects, developers, platform engineers,
administrators, and site reliability engineers.
Reliability
is a system's ability to consistently perform its intended
functions within the defined conditions and maintain uninterrupted service. Best
practices for reliability include redundancy, fault-tolerant design, monitoring,
and automated recovery processes.
As a part of reliability,
resilience
is the system's ability to withstand and
recover from failures or unexpected disruptions, while maintaining performance.
Google Cloud features, like
multi-regional deployments
,
automated backups, and disaster recovery solutions, can help you improve your
system's resilience.
Reliability is important to your cloud strategy for many reasons, including the
following:
Minimal downtime
: Downtime can lead to lost revenue, decreased
productivity, and damage to reputation. Resilient architectures can help
ensure that systems can continue to function during failures or recover
efficiently from failures.
Enhanced user experience
: Users expect seamless interactions with
technology. Resilient systems can help maintain consistent performance and
availability, and they provide reliable service even during high demand or
unexpected issues.
Data integrity
: Failures can cause data loss or data corruption.
Resilient systems implement mechanisms such as backups, redundancy, and
replication to protect data and ensure that it remains accurate and accessible.
Business continuity
: Your business relies on technology for critical
operations. Resilient architectures can help ensure continuity after a
catastrophic failure, which enables business functions to continue without
significant interruptions and supports a swift recovery.
Compliance
: Many industries have regulatory requirements for system
availability and data protection. Resilient architectures can help you to
meet these standards by ensuring systems remain operational and secure.
Lower long-term costs
: Resilient architectures require upfront
investment, but resiliency can help to reduce costs over time by preventing
expensive downtime, avoiding reactive fixes, and enabling more efficient
resource use.
Organizational mindset
To make your systems reliable, you need a plan and an established strategy.
This strategy must include education and the authority to prioritize reliability
alongside other initiatives.
Set a clear expectation that the entire organization is responsible for
reliability, including development, product management, operations, platform
engineering, and
site reliability engineering (SRE)
.
Even the business-focused groups, like marketing and sales, can influence
reliability.
Every team must understand the reliability targets and risks of their
applications. The teams must be accountable to these requirements. Conflicts
between reliability and regular product feature development must be prioritized
and escalated accordingly.
Plan and manage reliability holistically, across all your functions and teams.
Consider setting up a Cloud Centre of Excellence (CCoE) that includes a
reliability pillar. For more information, see
Optimize your organization's cloud journey with a Cloud Center of Excellence
.
Focus areas for reliability
The activities that you perform to design, deploy, and manage a reliable system
can be categorized in the following focus areas. Each of the reliability
principles and recommendations in this pillar is relevant to one of these focus
areas.
Scoping
: To understand your system, conduct a detailed analysis of
its architecture. You need to understand the components, how they work and
interact, how data and actions flow through the system, and what could go
wrong. Identify potential failures, bottlenecks, and risks, which helps you
to take actions to mitigate those issues.
Observation
: To help prevent system failures, implement
comprehensive and continuous observation and monitoring. Through this
observation, you can understand trends and identify potential problems
proactively.
Response
: To reduce the impact of failures, respond appropriately
and recover efficiently. Automated responses can also help reduce the
impact of failures. Even with planning and controls, failures can still occur.
Learning
: To help prevent failures from recurring, learn from each
experience, and take appropriate actions.
Core principles
The recommendations in the reliability pillar of the Well-Architected Framework are
mapped to the following core principles:
Define reliability based on user-experience goals
Set realistic targets for reliability
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
Take advantage of horizontal scalability
Detect potential failures by using observability
Design for graceful degradation
Perform testing for recovery from failures
Perform testing for recovery from data loss
Conduct thorough postmortems

Define reliability based on user-experience goals
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you to assess your users' experience, and then map the findings to
reliability goals and metrics.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Observability tools provide large amounts of data, but not all of the data
directly relates to the impacts on the users. For example, you might observe
high CPU usage, slow server operations, or even crashed tasks. However, if these
issues don't affect the user experience, then they don't constitute an outage.
To measure the user experience, you need to distinguish between internal system
behavior and user-facing problems. Focus on metrics like the success ratio of
user requests. Don't rely solely on server-centric metrics, like CPU usage,
which can lead to misleading conclusions about your service's reliability. True
reliability means that users can consistently and effectively use your
application or service.
Recommendations
To help you measure user experience effectively, consider the recommendations
in the following sections.
Measure user experience
To truly understand your service's reliability, prioritize metrics that reflect
your users' actual experience. For example, measure the users' query success
ratio, application latency, and error rates.
Ideally, collect this data directly from the user's device or browser. If this
direct data collection isn't feasible, shift your measurement point
progressively further away from the user in the system. For example, you can use
the load balancer or frontend service as the measurement point. This approach
helps you identify and address issues before those issues can significantly
impact your users.
Analyze user journeys
To understand how users interact with your system, you can use tracing tools
like
Cloud Trace
.
By following a user's journey through your application, you can find bottlenecks
and latency issues that might degrade the user's experience. Cloud Trace
captures detailed performance data for each
hop
in your service architecture.
This data helps you identify and address performance issues more efficiently,
which can lead to a more reliable and satisfying user experience.
Set realistic targets for reliability
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you define reliability goals that are technically feasible for your
workloads in Google Cloud.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Design your systems to be just reliable enough for user happiness. It might
seem counterintuitive, but a goal of 100% reliability is often not the most
effective strategy. Higher reliability might result in a significantly higher
cost, both in terms of financial investment and potential limitations on
innovation. If users are already happy with the current level of service, then
efforts to further increase happiness might yield a low return on investment.
Instead, you can better spend resources elsewhere.
You need to determine the level of reliability at which your users are happy,
and determine the point where the cost of incremental improvements begin to
outweigh the benefits. When you determine this level of
sufficient
reliability
, you can allocate resources strategically and focus on features and
improvements that deliver greater value to your users.
Recommendations
To set realistic reliability targets, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Accept some failure and prioritize components
Aim for high availability such as 99.99% uptime, but don't set a target of 100%
uptime. Acknowledge that some failures are inevitable.
The gap between 100% uptime and a 99.99% target is the allowance for failure.
This gap is often called the
error budget
. The error budget can help you take
risks and innovate, which is fundamental to any business to stay competitive.
Prioritize the reliability of the most critical components in the system.
Accept that less critical components can have a higher tolerance for failure.
Balance reliability and cost
To determine the optimal reliability level for your system, conduct thorough
cost-benefit analyses.
Consider factors like system requirements, the consequences of failures, and
your organization's risk tolerance for the specific application. Remember to
consider your
disaster recovery metrics
,
such as the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).
Decide what level of reliability is acceptable within the budget and other
constraints.
Look for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs without compromising
essential reliability features.
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to plan, build, and manage resource redundancy, which
can help you to avoid failures.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
After you
decide the level of reliability
that you need, you must design your systems to avoid any
single points of failure
.
Every critical component in the system must be replicated across multiple
machines, zones, and
regions
.
For example, a critical database can't be located in only one region, and a
metadata server can't be deployed in only one single zone or region. In those
examples, if the sole zone or region has an outage, the system has a global
outage.
Recommendations
To build redundant systems, consider the recommendations in the following
subsections.
Identify failure domains and replicate services
Map out your system's
failure domains
,
from individual VMs to regions, and design for redundancy across the failure
domains.
To ensure high availability, distribute and replicate your services and
applications across multiple zones and regions. Configure the system for
automatic failover to make sure that the services and applications continue to
be available in the event of zone or region outages.
For examples of multi-zone and multi-region architectures, see
Design reliable infrastructure for your workloads in Google Cloud
.
Detect and address issues promptly
Continuously track the status of your failure domains to detect and address
issues promptly.
You can monitor the current status of Google Cloud services in all regions
by using the
Google Cloud Service Health dashboard
.
You can also view incidents relevant to your project by using
Personalized Service Health
.
You can use load balancers to detect resource health and automatically route
traffic to healthy backends. For more information, see
Health checks overview
.
Test failover scenarios
Like a fire drill, regularly simulate failures to validate the effectiveness of
your replication and failover strategies.
For more information, see
Simulate a zone outage for a regional MIG
and
Simulate a zone failure in GKE regional clusters
.
Take advantage of horizontal scalability
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you use horizontal scalability. By using
horizontal scalability, you can help ensure that your workloads in
Google Cloud can scale efficiently and maintain performance.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Re-architect your system to a horizontal architecture. To accommodate growth in
traffic or data, you can add more resources. You can also remove resources when
they're not in use.
To understand the value of horizontal scaling, consider the limitations of
vertical scaling.
A common scenario for vertical scaling is to use a MySQL database as the
primary database with critical data. As database usage increases, more RAM and
CPU is required. Eventually, the database reaches the memory limit on the host
machine, and needs to be upgraded. This process might need to be repeated
several times. The problem is that there are hard limits on how much a database
can grow. VM sizes are not unlimited. The database can reach a point when it's
no longer possible to add more resources.
Even if resources were unlimited, a large VM can become a single point of
failure. Any problem with the primary database VM can cause error responses or
cause a system-wide outage that affects all users. Avoid single points of
failure, as described in
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
.
Besides these scaling limits, vertical scaling tends to be more expensive. The
cost can increase exponentially as machines with greater amounts of compute
power and memory are acquired.
Horizontal scaling, by contrast, can cost less. The potential for horizontal
scaling is virtually unlimited in a system that's designed to scale.
Recommendations
To transition from a single VM architecture to a horizontal multiple-machine
architecture, you need to plan carefully and use the right tools. To help you
achieve horizontal scaling, consider the recommendations in the following
subsections.
Use managed services
Managed services remove the need to manually manage horizontal scaling. For
example, with Compute Engine managed instance groups (MIGs), you can add or
remove VMs to scale your application horizontally. For containerized
applications, Cloud Run is a serverless platform that can automatically
scale your stateless containers based on incoming traffic.
Promote modular design
Modular components and clear interfaces help you scale individual components as
needed, instead of scaling the entire application. For more information, see
Promote modular design
in the performance optimization pillar.
Implement a stateless design
Design applications to be stateless, meaning no locally stored data. This lets
you add or remove instances without worrying about data consistency.
Detect potential failures by using observability
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you proactively identify areas where errors and
failures might occur.
This principle is relevant to the
observation
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
To maintain and improve the reliability of your workloads in
Google Cloud, you need to implement effective observability by using
metrics, logs, and traces.
Metrics are numerical measurements of activities that you want to track
for your application at specific time intervals. For example, you might
want to track technical metrics like request rate and error rate, which can
be used as service-level indicators (SLIs). You might also need to track
application-specific business metrics like orders placed and payments received.
Logs are time-stamped records of discrete events that occur within an
application or system. The event could be a failure, an error, or a change
in state. Logs might include metrics, and you can also use logs for SLIs.
A trace represents the journey of a single user or transaction through a
number of separate applications or the components of an application. For
example, these components could be microservices. Traces help you to track
what components were used in the journeys, where bottlenecks exist, and how
long the journeys took.
Metrics, logs, and traces help you monitor your system continuously.
Comprehensive monitoring helps you find out where and why errors occurred. You
can also detect potential failures before errors occur.
Recommendations
To detect potential failures efficiently, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Gain comprehensive insights
To track key metrics like response times and error rates, use
Cloud Monitoring
and
Cloud Logging
.
These tools also help you to ensure that the metrics consistently meet the needs
of your workload.
To make data-driven decisions, analyze default service metrics to understand
component dependencies and their impact on overall workload performance.
To customize your monitoring strategy, create and publish your own metrics by
using the Google Cloud SDK.
Perform proactive troubleshooting
Implement robust error handling and enable logging across all of the components
of your workloads in Google Cloud. Activate logs like
Cloud Storage access logs
and
VPC Flow Logs
.
When you configure logging, consider the associated
costs
.
To control logging costs, you can configure
exclusion filters
on the log sinks to exclude certain logs from being stored.
Optimize resource utilization
Monitor CPU consumption, network I/O metrics, and disk I/O metrics to detect
under-provisioned and over-provisioned resources in services like
GKE, Compute Engine, and Dataproc. For a
complete list of supported services, see
Cloud Monitoring overview
.
Prioritize alerts
For alerts, focus on critical metrics, set appropriate thresholds to minimize
alert fatigue, and ensure timely responses to significant issues. This targeted
approach lets you proactively maintain workload reliability. For more
information, see
Alerting overview
.
Design for graceful degradation
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you to design your Google Cloud workloads
to fail gracefully.
This principle is relevant to the
response
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Graceful degradation is a design approach where a system that experiences a
high load continues to function, possibly with reduced performance or accuracy.
Graceful degradation ensures continued availability of the system and prevents
complete failure, even if the system's work isn't optimal. When the load returns
to a manageable level, the system resumes full functionality.
For example, during periods of high load, Google Search prioritizes results
from higher-ranked web pages, potentially sacrificing some accuracy. When the
load decreases, Google Search recomputes the search results.
Recommendations
To design your systems for graceful degradation, consider the recommendations
in the following subsections.
Implement throttling
Ensure that your replicas can independently handle overloads and can throttle
incoming requests during high-traffic scenarios. This approach helps you to
prevent cascading failures that are caused by shifts in excess traffic between
zones.
Use tools like
Apigee
to control the rate of API requests during high-traffic times. You can configure
policy rules to reflect how you want to scale back requests.
Drop excess requests early
Configure your systems to drop excess requests at the frontend layer to protect
backend components. Dropping some requests prevents global failures and enables
the system to recover more gracefully.With this approach, some users might
experience errors. However, you can minimize the impact of outages, in contrast
to an approach like
circuit-breaking
, where
all
traffic is dropped during an
overload.
Handle partial errors and retries
Build your applications to handle partial errors and retries seamlessly. This
design helps to ensure that as much traffic as possible is served during
high-load scenarios.
Test overload scenarios
To validate that the throttle and request-drop mechanisms work effectively,
regularly simulate overload conditions in your system. Testing helps ensure that
your system is prepared for real-world traffic surges.
Monitor traffic spikes
Use analytics and monitoring tools to predict and respond to traffic surges
before they escalate into overloads. Early detection and response can help
maintain service availability during high-demand periods.
Perform testing for recovery from failures
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you design and run tests for recovery in the
event of failures.
This principle is relevant to the
learning
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
To be sure that your system can recover from failures, you must periodically
run tests that include regional failovers, release rollbacks, and data
restoration from backups.
This testing helps you to practice responses to events that pose major risks to
reliability, such as the outage of an entire
region
.
This testing also helps you verify that your system behaves as intended during a
disruption.
In the unlikely event of an entire region going down, you need to fail over all
traffic to another region. During normal operation of your workload, when data
is modified, it needs to be synchronized from the primary region to the failover
region. You need to verify that the replicated data is always very recent, so
that users don't experience data loss or session breakage. The load balancing
system must also be able to shift traffic to the failover region at any time
without service interruptions. To minimize downtime after a regional outage,
operations engineers also need to be able to manually and efficiently shift user
traffic away from a region, in as less time as possible. This operation is
sometimes called
draining a region
, which means you stop the inbound traffic
to the region and move all the traffic elsewhere.
Recommendations
When you design and run tests for failure recovery, consider the
recommendations in the following subsections.
Define the testing objectives and scope
Clearly define what you want to achieve from the testing. For example, your
objectives can include the following:
Validate the recovery time objective (RTO) and the recovery point
objective (RPO). For details, see
Basics of DR planning
.
Assess system resilience and fault tolerance under various failure
scenarios.
Test the effectiveness of automated failover mechanisms.
Decide which components, services, or regions are in the testing scope. The
scope can include specific application tiers like the frontend, backend, and
database, or it can include specific Google Cloud resources like
Cloud SQL instances or GKE clusters. The scope must also specify any
external dependencies, such as third-party APIs or cloud interconnections.
Prepare the environment for testing
Choose an appropriate environment, preferably a staging or sandbox environment
that replicates your production setup. If you conduct the test in production,
ensure that you have safety measures ready, like automated monitoring and manual
rollback procedures.
Create a backup plan. Take snapshots or backups of critical databases and
services to prevent data loss during the test. Ensure that your team is prepared
to do manual interventions if the automated failover mechanisms fail.
To prevent test disruptions, ensure that your IAM roles,
policies, and failover configurations are correctly set up. Verify that the
necessary permissions are in place for the test tools and scripts.
Inform stakeholders, including operations, DevOps, and application owners,
about the test schedule, scope, and potential impact. Provide stakeholders with
an estimated timeline and the expected behaviors during the test.
Simulate failure scenarios
Plan and execute failures by using tools like
Chaos Monkey
.
You can use custom scripts to simulate failures of critical services such as a
shutdown of a primary node in a multi-zone GKE cluster or a disabled
Cloud SQL instance. You can also use scripts to simulate a region-wide
network outage by using firewall rules or API restrictions based on your scope
of test. Gradually escalate the failure scenarios to observe system behavior
under various conditions.
Introduce load testing alongside failure scenarios to replicate real-world
usage during outages. Test cascading failure impacts, such as how frontend
systems behave when backend services are unavailable.
To validate configuration changes and to assess the system's resilience against
human errors, test scenarios that involve misconfigurations. For example, run
tests with incorrect DNS failover settings or incorrect IAM
permissions.
Monitor system behavior
Monitor how load balancers, health checks, and other mechanisms reroute
traffic. Use Google Cloud tools like Cloud Monitoring and
Cloud Logging to capture metrics and events during the test.
Observe changes in latency, error rates, and throughput during and after the
failure simulation, and monitor the overall performance impact. Identify any
degradation or inconsistencies in the user experience.
Ensure that logs are generated and alerts are triggered for key events, such as
service outages or failovers. Use this data to verify the effectiveness of your
alerting and incident response systems.
Verify recovery against your RTO and RPO
Measure how long it takes for the system to resume normal operations after a
failure, and then compare this data with the defined RTO and document any
gaps.
Ensure that data integrity and availability align with the RPO. To test
database consistency, compare snapshots or backups of the database before and
after a failure.
Evaluate service restoration and confirm that all services are restored to a
functional state with minimal user disruption.
Document and analyze results
Document each test step, failure scenario, and corresponding system behavior.
Include timestamps, logs, and metrics for detailed analyses.
Highlight bottlenecks, single points of failure, or unexpected behaviors
observed during the test. To help prioritize fixes, categorize issues by
severity and impact.
Suggest improvements to the system architecture, failover mechanisms, or
monitoring setups. Based on test findings, update any relevant failover policies
and playbooks. Present a postmortem report to stakeholders. The report should
summarize the outcomes, lessons learned, and next steps. For more information,
see
Conduct thorough postmortems
.
Iterate and improve
To validate ongoing reliability and resilience, plan periodic testing (for
example, quarterly).
Run tests under different scenarios, including infrastructure changes, software
updates, and increased traffic loads.
Automate failover tests by using CI/CD pipelines to integrate reliability
testing into your development lifecycle.
During the postmortem, use feedback from stakeholders and end users to improve
the test process and system resilience.
Perform testing for recovery from data loss
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you design and run tests for recovery from data
loss.
This principle is relevant to the
learning
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
To ensure that your system can recover from situations where data is lost or
corrupted, you need to run tests for those scenarios. Instances of data loss
might be caused by a software bug or some type of natural disaster. After such
events, you need to restore data from backups and bring all of the services back
up again by using the freshly restored data.
We recommend that you use three criteria to judge the success or failure of this
type of recovery test: data integrity, recovery time objective (RTO), and
recovery point objective (RPO). For details about the RTO and RPO metrics, see
Basics of DR planning
.
The goal of data restoration testing is to periodically verify that your
organization can continue to meet business continuity requirements. Besides
measuring RTO and RPO, a data restoration test must include testing of the
entire application stack and all the critical infrastructure services with the
restored data. This is necessary to confirm that the entire deployed application
works correctly in the test environment.
Recommendations
When you design and run tests for recovering from data loss, consider the
recommendations in the following subsections.
Verify backup consistency and test restoration processes
You need to verify that your backups contain consistent and usable snapshots of
data that you can restore to immediately bring applications back into service.
To validate data integrity, set up automated consistency checks to run after
each backup.
To test backups, restore them in a non-production environment. To ensure your
backups can be restored efficiently and that the restored data meets application
requirements, regularly simulate data recovery scenarios. Document the steps for
data restoration, and train your teams to execute the steps effectively during a
failure.
Schedule regular and frequent backups
To minimize data loss during restoration and to meet RPO targets, it's
essential to have regularly scheduled backups. Establish a backup frequency that
aligns with your RPO. For example, if your RPO is 15 minutes, schedule backups
to run at least every 15 minutes. Optimize the backup intervals to reduce the
risk of data loss.
Use Google Cloud tools like Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL
automated backups, or Spanner backups to schedule and manage backups.
For critical applications, use near-continuous backup solutions like
point-in-time recovery (PITR) for Cloud SQL
or incremental backups for large datasets.
Define and monitor RPO
Set a clear RPO based on your business needs, and monitor adherence to the RPO.
If backup intervals exceed the defined RPO, use Cloud Monitoring to set up
alerts.
Monitor backup health
Use
Google Cloud Backup and DR service
or similar tools to track the health of your backups and confirm that they are
stored in secure and reliable locations. Ensure that the backups are replicated
across multiple
regions
for added resilience.
Plan for scenarios beyond backup
Combine backups with disaster recovery strategies like active-active failover
setups or cross-region replication for improved recovery time in extreme cases.
For more information, see
Disaster recovery planning guide
.
Conduct thorough postmortems
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you conduct effective postmortems after
failures and incidents.
This principle is relevant to the
learning
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
A postmortem is a written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken
to mitigate or resolve the incident, the root causes, and the follow-up actions
to prevent the incident from recurring. The goal of a postmortem is to learn
from mistakes and not assign blame.
The following diagram shows the workflow of a postmortem:
The workflow of a postmortem includes the following steps:
Create postmortem
Capture the facts
Identify and analyze the root causes
Plan for the future
Execute the plan
Conduct postmortem analyses after major events and non-major events like the
following:
User-visible downtimes or degradations beyond a certain threshold.
Data losses of any kind.
Interventions from on-call engineers, such as a release rollback or
rerouting of traffic.
Resolution times above a defined threshold.
Monitoring failures, which usually imply manual incident discovery.
Recommendations
Define postmortem criteria before an incident occurs so that everyone knows
when a post mortem is necessary.
To conduct effective postmortems, consider the recommendations in the following
subsections.
Conduct blameless postmortems
Effective postmortems focus on processes, tools, and technologies, and don't
place blame on individuals or teams. The purpose of a postmortem analysis is to
improve your technology and future, not to find who is guilty. Everyone makes
mistakes. The goal should be to analyze the mistakes and learn from them.
The following examples show the difference between feedback that assigns blame
and blameless feedback:
Feedback that assigns blame
: "We need to rewrite the entire
complicated backend system! It's been breaking weekly for the last three
quarters and I'm sure we're all tired of fixing things piecemeal.
Seriously, if I get paged one more time I'll rewrite it myself…"
Blameless feedback
: "An action item to rewrite the entire backend
system might actually prevent these pages from continuing to happen. The
maintenance manual for this version is quite long and really difficult to
be fully trained up on. I'm sure our future on-call engineers will thank us!"
Make the postmortem report readable by all the intended audiences
For each piece of information that you plan to include in the report, assess
whether that information is important and necessary to help the audience
understand what happened. You can move supplementary data and explanations to an
appendix of the report. Reviewers who need more information can request it.
Avoid complex or over-engineered solutions
Before you start to explore solutions for a problem, evaluate the importance of
the problem and the likelihood of a recurrence. Adding complexity to the system
to solve problems that are unlikely to occur again can lead to increased
instability.
Share the postmortem as widely as possible
To ensure that issues don't remain unresolved, publish the outcome of the
postmortem to a wide audience and get support from management. The value of a
postmortem is proportional to the learning that occurs after the postmortem.
When more people learn from incidents, the likelihood of similar failures
recurring is reduced.

Set realistic targets for reliability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you define reliability goals that are technically feasible for your
workloads in Google Cloud.
This principle is relevant to the
scoping
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
Design your systems to be just reliable enough for user happiness. It might
seem counterintuitive, but a goal of 100% reliability is often not the most
effective strategy. Higher reliability might result in a significantly higher
cost, both in terms of financial investment and potential limitations on
innovation. If users are already happy with the current level of service, then
efforts to further increase happiness might yield a low return on investment.
Instead, you can better spend resources elsewhere.
You need to determine the level of reliability at which your users are happy,
and determine the point where the cost of incremental improvements begin to
outweigh the benefits. When you determine this level of
sufficient
reliability
, you can allocate resources strategically and focus on features and
improvements that deliver greater value to your users.
Recommendations
To set realistic reliability targets, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Accept some failure and prioritize components
Aim for high availability such as 99.99% uptime, but don't set a target of 100%
uptime. Acknowledge that some failures are inevitable.
The gap between 100% uptime and a 99.99% target is the allowance for failure.
This gap is often called the
error budget
. The error budget can help you take
risks and innovate, which is fundamental to any business to stay competitive.
Prioritize the reliability of the most critical components in the system.
Accept that less critical components can have a higher tolerance for failure.
Balance reliability and cost
To determine the optimal reliability level for your system, conduct thorough
cost-benefit analyses.
Consider factors like system requirements, the consequences of failures, and
your organization's risk tolerance for the specific application. Remember to
consider your
disaster recovery metrics
,
such as the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).

Detect potential failures by using observability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the reliability pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you proactively identify areas where errors and
failures might occur.
This principle is relevant to the
observation
focus area
of reliability.
Principle overview
To maintain and improve the reliability of your workloads in
Google Cloud, you need to implement effective observability by using
metrics, logs, and traces.
Metrics are numerical measurements of activities that you want to track
for your application at specific time intervals. For example, you might
want to track technical metrics like request rate and error rate, which can
be used as service-level indicators (SLIs). You might also need to track
application-specific business metrics like orders placed and payments received.
Logs are time-stamped records of discrete events that occur within an
application or system. The event could be a failure, an error, or a change
in state. Logs might include metrics, and you can also use logs for SLIs.
A trace represents the journey of a single user or transaction through a
number of separate applications or the components of an application. For
example, these components could be microservices. Traces help you to track
what components were used in the journeys, where bottlenecks exist, and how
long the journeys took.
Metrics, logs, and traces help you monitor your system continuously.
Comprehensive monitoring helps you find out where and why errors occurred. You
can also detect potential failures before errors occur.
Recommendations
To detect potential failures efficiently, consider the recommendations in the
following subsections.
Gain comprehensive insights
To track key metrics like response times and error rates, use
Cloud Monitoring
and
Cloud Logging
.
These tools also help you to ensure that the metrics consistently meet the needs
of your workload.
To make data-driven decisions, analyze default service metrics to understand
component dependencies and their impact on overall workload performance.
To customize your monitoring strategy, create and publish your own metrics by
using the Google Cloud SDK.
Perform proactive troubleshooting
Implement robust error handling and enable logging across all of the components
of your workloads in Google Cloud. Activate logs like
Cloud Storage access logs
and
VPC Flow Logs
.
When you configure logging, consider the associated
costs
.
To control logging costs, you can configure
exclusion filters
on the log sinks to exclude certain logs from being stored.
Optimize resource utilization
Monitor CPU consumption, network I/O metrics, and disk I/O metrics to detect
under-provisioned and over-provisioned resources in services like
GKE, Compute Engine, and Dataproc. For a
complete list of supported services, see
Cloud Monitoring overview
.
Prioritize alerts
For alerts, focus on critical metrics, set appropriate thresholds to minimize
alert fatigue, and ensure timely responses to significant issues. This targeted
approach lets you proactively maintain workload reliability. For more
information, see
Alerting overview
.

The reliability pillar in the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides principles and recommendations to help you design, deploy, and manage
reliable workloads in Google Cloud.
This document is intended for cloud architects, developers, platform engineers,
administrators, and site reliability engineers.
Reliability
is a system's ability to consistently perform its intended
functions within the defined conditions and maintain uninterrupted service. Best
practices for reliability include redundancy, fault-tolerant design, monitoring,
and automated recovery processes.
As a part of reliability,
resilience
is the system's ability to withstand and
recover from failures or unexpected disruptions, while maintaining performance.
Google Cloud features, like
multi-regional deployments
,
automated backups, and disaster recovery solutions, can help you improve your
system's resilience.
Reliability is important to your cloud strategy for many reasons, including the
following:
Minimal downtime
: Downtime can lead to lost revenue, decreased
productivity, and damage to reputation. Resilient architectures can help
ensure that systems can continue to function during failures or recover
efficiently from failures.
Enhanced user experience
: Users expect seamless interactions with
technology. Resilient systems can help maintain consistent performance and
availability, and they provide reliable service even during high demand or
unexpected issues.
Data integrity
: Failures can cause data loss or data corruption.
Resilient systems implement mechanisms such as backups, redundancy, and
replication to protect data and ensure that it remains accurate and accessible.
Business continuity
: Your business relies on technology for critical
operations. Resilient architectures can help ensure continuity after a
catastrophic failure, which enables business functions to continue without
significant interruptions and supports a swift recovery.
Compliance
: Many industries have regulatory requirements for system
availability and data protection. Resilient architectures can help you to
meet these standards by ensuring systems remain operational and secure.
Lower long-term costs
: Resilient architectures require upfront
investment, but resiliency can help to reduce costs over time by preventing
expensive downtime, avoiding reactive fixes, and enabling more efficient
resource use.
Organizational mindset
To make your systems reliable, you need a plan and an established strategy.
This strategy must include education and the authority to prioritize reliability
alongside other initiatives.
Set a clear expectation that the entire organization is responsible for
reliability, including development, product management, operations, platform
engineering, and
site reliability engineering (SRE)
.
Even the business-focused groups, like marketing and sales, can influence
reliability.
Every team must understand the reliability targets and risks of their
applications. The teams must be accountable to these requirements. Conflicts
between reliability and regular product feature development must be prioritized
and escalated accordingly.
Plan and manage reliability holistically, across all your functions and teams.
Consider setting up a Cloud Centre of Excellence (CCoE) that includes a
reliability pillar. For more information, see
Optimize your organization's cloud journey with a Cloud Center of Excellence
.
Focus areas for reliability
The activities that you perform to design, deploy, and manage a reliable system
can be categorized in the following focus areas. Each of the reliability
principles and recommendations in this pillar is relevant to one of these focus
areas.
Scoping
: To understand your system, conduct a detailed analysis of
its architecture. You need to understand the components, how they work and
interact, how data and actions flow through the system, and what could go
wrong. Identify potential failures, bottlenecks, and risks, which helps you
to take actions to mitigate those issues.
Observation
: To help prevent system failures, implement
comprehensive and continuous observation and monitoring. Through this
observation, you can understand trends and identify potential problems
proactively.
Response
: To reduce the impact of failures, respond appropriately
and recover efficiently. Automated responses can also help reduce the
impact of failures. Even with planning and controls, failures can still occur.
Learning
: To help prevent failures from recurring, learn from each
experience, and take appropriate actions.
Core principles
The recommendations in the reliability pillar of the Well-Architected Framework are
mapped to the following core principles:
Define reliability based on user-experience goals
Set realistic targets for reliability
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy
Take advantage of horizontal scalability
Detect potential failures by using observability
Design for graceful degradation
Perform testing for recovery from failures
Perform testing for recovery from data loss
Conduct thorough postmortems
Note:

Google Cloud, see
