If you're building GWP-ASan as part of a compiler-rt/LLVM build, add it during. cmake configure time (e.g. ``cmake ... -DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\"...\"``). If. you're building GWP-ASan outside of compiler-rt, simply ensure that you. specify ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\"...\"`` when building. ``optional/options_parser.cpp``). - By defining a ``__gwp_asan_default_options`` function in one's program that. returns the options string to be parsed. Said function must have the following. prototype: ``extern C const char* __gwp_asan_default_options(void)``, with a. default visibility.

The width of the function minimum, or more generally,. the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives. information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often. called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M. is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. $\\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition . Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will. depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of. $\\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\\mbox{FCN}$ is. everywhere multiplied by a constant $\\beta$, then the errors will be. decreased by a factor $\\sqrt{\\beta}$. Additive constants do not change. the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit. confidence level. Assuming that the user knows what the normalization of their. $\\mbox{FCN}$ means, and also that they are interested in parameter. errors, the user can change the error definition which allows them to. define what they means by one error\", in terms of the change in the. $\\mbox{FCN}$ value which should be caused by changing one parameter. by one error\". If the $\\mbox{FCN}$ is the usual chisquare function.

If the $\\mbox{FCN}$ is a. chisquare, but the user wants two-standard-deviation errors, then. FCNBase::up() should return $= 4.0$, etc. Note that in the usual case where M is being used to perform a fit to. some experimental data, the parameter errors will be proportional to the. uncertainty in the data, and therefore meaningful parameter errors. cannot be obtained unless the measurement errors of the data are known.

Therefore I added the function TGraphPainter::PaintGraphMultiErrors and included a corresponding line in the TGraphPainter::PaintHelper function. **Drawing / Painting options**. To be able to define different drawing options for the multiple error dimensions the option string can consist of multiple blocks separated by semicolons. The painting method separates the options in multiple options for each y error dimension and one for basic painting and the x errors. In case there are <= NErrorDimensions blocks given, the first block is used for basic painting and for the first dimension of y errors. Y error dimensions without an individual block are painted with “”. Tn case there are NErrorDimensions + 1 given, the first block is used only for basic painting. The remaining blocks are distributed over the y error dimensions In case there are > NErrorDimensions + 1 blocks given an error is returned. All drawing options of TGraphAsymmErrors are implemented. For explanation of the drawing options see TGraphPainter::PaintGraphAsymmErrors. Additionally one can specify x0 or y0 to skip points with x = 0 or y = 0 The Draw option s=%f can be used to multiply the corresponding x errors with %f. This is useful in combination with e.g. option 2 if the boxes are supposed to have only half the width of the bin, in this case the option would be s=0.5. Per default the Fill and Line Styles of the Graph are being used for all error dimensions. To use the specific ones add the draw option s to the first block.

The ``cppyy-backend`` module contains two areas:. * A patched copy of cling. * Wrapper code. Package structure. -----------------. .. _package-structure:. There are four PyPA packages involved in a full installation, with the. following structure::. (A) _cppyy (PyPy). / \\. (1) cppyy (3) cppyy-backend -- (4) cppyy-cling. \\ /. (2) CPyCppyy (CPython). The user-facing package is always ``cppyy`` (1). It is used to select the other (versioned) required packages, based on the. python interpreter for which it is being installed. Below (1) follows a bifurcation based on interpreter. This is needed for functionality and performance: for CPython, there is the. CPyCppyy package (2). It is written in C++, makes use of the Python C-API, and installs as a Python. extension module. For PyPy, there is the builtin module ``_cppyy`` (A). This is not a PyPA package. It is written in RPython as it needs access to low-level pointers, JIT hints,. and the ``_cffi_backend`` backend module (itself builtin). Shared again across interpreters is the backend, which is split in a small. wrapper (3) and a large package that contains Cling/LLVM (4). The former is still under development and expected to be updated frequently. It is small enough to download and build very quickly. The latter, however, takes a long time to build, but since it is very stable,. splitting it off allows the creation of binary wheels that need updating. only infrequently (expected about twice a year).

Monotonic stores can. be DSE'ed in some cases, but it's tricky to reason about, and not especially. important. It is possible in some case for DSE to operate across a stronger. atomic operation, but it is fairly tricky. DSE delegates this reasoning to. MemoryDependencyAnalysis (which is also used by other passes like GVN). * Folding a load: Any atomic load from a constant global can be constant-folded,. because it cannot be observed. Similar reasoning allows sroa with. atomic loads and stores. Atomics and Codegen. ===================. Atomic operations are represented in the SelectionDAG with ``ATOMIC_*`` opcodes. On architectures which use barrier instructions for all atomic ordering (like. ARM), appropriate fences can be emitted by the AtomicExpand Codegen pass if. ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()`` returns true. The MachineMemOperand for all atomic operations is currently marked as volatile;. this is not correct in the IR sense of volatile, but CodeGen handles anything. marked volatile very conservatively. This should get fixed at some point. One very important property of the atomic operations is that if your backend. supports any inline lock-free atomic operations of a given size, you should. support *ALL* operations of that size in a lock-free manner. When the target implements atomic ``cmpxchg`` or LL/SC instructions (as most do). this is trivial: all the other operations can be implemented on top of those. primitives. However, on many older CPUs (e.g. ARMv5, SparcV8, Intel 80386) there. are atomic load and store instructions, but no ``cmpxchg`` or LL/SC. As it is. invalid to implement ``atomic load`` using the native instruction, but. ``cmpxchg`` using a library call to a function that uses a mutex, ``atomic. load`` must *also* expand to a library call on such architectures, so that it. can remain atomic with regards to a simulta',\n",

If no other means are used to avoid problems, and the compilation is successful, directly adding the same name to the std will potentially lead to many surprises. . If I understand correctly, the same is true for `std::string_view`. See `RStringView.hxx`:. ```C++. if defined(R__HAS_STD_STRING_VIEW) || R__MSVC_LANG >= 201703L || __cplusplus >= 201703L. include <string_view>. else. if defined(R__HAS_STD_EXPERIMENTAL_STRING_VIEW). include <experimental/string_view>. else. include RWrap_libcpp_string_view.h\". endif. ```. There is also a feature test macro. If someone uses C++17 and links to the ROOT compiled by C++14, they might encounter the same issue. I think it is a better practice to change a namespace (such as `cxx20::span`, `cxx17::string_view`, etc.) and provide the corresponding implicit conversion when the standard matches. In this way, users will not be disturbed to use normally, and these features are also available inside ROOT. The only symmetry break is in the API. Because the features exposed are not those of the standard library, users may need to manually convert them in some cases, so implicit conversion should be provided. . For example:. ```C++. if __cplusplus >= 202002L. include <span>. endif. namespace cxx20 {. constexpr std::size_t dynamic_extent =. if __cplusplus >= 202002L. std::dynamic_extent;. else. /* something */;. endif. template<class T, std::size_t Extent = dynamic_extent>. class span {. // ... here is the normal implementation. if __cplusplus >= 202002L. public:. constexpr operator std::span<T, Extent>() noexcept;. constexpr span(const std::span<T, Extent>& other) noexcept;. constexpr span& operator=(const std::span<T, Extent>& other) noexcept;. endif. // ... here is the normal implementation, too. };. }. ```.

       "       'I'm quite baffled every time I come in contact with it, how you guys manage to survive with such a testing infrastructure. :confused: I did have a fork of [roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest) from a long time ago. https://github.com/krasznaa/roottest. What I didn't have was it being up to date with the main repository. Plus, did I see correctly in your copy-pasted error message that the CI complained about not finding a branch in my roottest fork with the same name as the branch that I opened this PR from? :confused: What the heck? Is it really expected that one would create a branch in both repositories to make a modification to ROOT? After some deliberation I updated the PR as you can see. The setup that you guys have with `ROOTConfig.cmake` being generated twice, and one of them possibly being used already during the main configuration is... unique... (Just so that I stay PC...) I've seen similar configurations being used for header-only libraries in the past, but never for anything that needed an actual build before becoming usable. In any case, making `ROOTConfig.cmake` skip `find_dependency(Vdt)` if `VDT::VDT` is already available as a target, was the most robust thing that I could come up with...',\n",
       "       'NEON's setup for vmlal_u32 is a little more complicated than it is on SSE2, AVX2, and VSX. While PMULUDQ and VMULEUW both perform a mask, VMLAL.U32 performs an upcast. To do the same operation, the 128-bit Q register needs to be split into two 64-bit D registers, performing this operation:: [ a | b ] | ---------. .-------- | | x | | .--------- --------. | [ a & 0xFFFFFFFF | b & 0xFFFFFFFF ],[ a >> 32 | b >> 32 ] Due to significant changes in aarch64, the fastest method for aarch64 is completely different than the fastest method for ARMv7-A. ARMv7-A treats D registers as unions overlaying Q registers, so modifying D11 will modify the high half of Q5. This is similar to how modifying AH will only affect bits 8-15 of AX on x86. VZIP takes two registers, and puts even lanes in one register and odd lanes in the other. On ARMv7-A, this strangely modifies both parameters in place instead of taking the usual 3-operand form. Therefore, if we want to do this, we can simply use a D-form VZIP.32 on the lower and upper halves of the Q register to end up with the high and low halves where we want - all in one instruction. vzip.32 d10, d11 @ d10 = { d10[0], d11[0] }; d11 = { d10[1], d11[1] } Unfortunately we need inline assembly for this: Instructions modifying two registers at once is not possible in GCC or Clang's IR, and they have to create a copy. aarch64 requires a different approach. In order to make it easier to write a decent compiler for aarch64, many quirks were removed, such as conditional execution. NEON was also affected by this. aarch64 cannot access the high bits of a Q-form register, and writes to a D-form register zero the high bits, similar to how writes to W-form scalar registers (or DWORD registers on x86_64) work. The formerly free vget_high intrinsics now require a vext (with a few exceptions) Additionally, VZIP was replaced by ZIP1 and ZIP2, which are the equivalent of PUNPCKL* and P'],\n",
