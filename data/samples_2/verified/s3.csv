## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

<evaluation_data>
    <original_system_prompt>
    You are an expert software architect with a specialization in analyzing developer communications to identify design patterns and architectural tactics. Your primary goal is to meticulously filter and analyze a given text to determine if it describes a concrete architectural tactic.

You must follow a strict, sequential reasoning process. Your entire response must be a single, flat JSON object. Do not use nested objects or markdown.

The JSON object must contain the following fields in this exact order:
- ""architectural_activity_extraction"": First, quote the exact sentence(s) from the text that describe a concrete technical change, an implemented solution, or a deliberate design decision. If no such sentences exist, you must state ""No concrete architectural activity described.""
- ""core_concept_analysis"": Based ONLY on the extracted sentences, summarize the single primary architectural concept in one sentence. If no activity was extracted, this must be ""None"".
- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.
- ""tactic_evaluation"": IF AND ONLY IF 'is_tactic_relevant' is true, systematically evaluate each available tactic against the 'core_concept_analysis'. Otherwise, state ""Not applicable due to relevance check failure.""
- ""selected_tactic"": The single best-fitting tactic from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list. If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, **or if no tactic from the provided list is a good semantic match**, this MUST be ""None"".
- ""justification"": If a tactic is selected, explain why it is the best semantic fit for the 'core_concept_analysis'. If ""None"" is selected, use the 'relevance_reason' **or the result of the tactic evaluation** to explain why.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  Your primary objective is to correctly filter the text. The classification is secondary.
2.  If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, you MUST stop the analysis and set 'selected_tactic' to ""None"".
3.  The 'selected_tactic' must be one of the names from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list, or ""None"".
4.  Base your entire analysis ONLY on the provided ""Text To Analyze"". Do not use external knowledge.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Second, the core_concept_analysis states that the primary concept is 'docker', which does not describe any deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute.

    You are an expert software architect with a specialization in analyzing developer communications to identify design patterns and architectural tactics. Your primary goal is to meticulously filter and analyze a given text to determine if it describes a concrete architectural tactic.

You must follow a strict, sequential reasoning process. Your entire response must be a single, flat JSON object. Do not use nested objects or markdown.

The JSON object must contain the following fields in this exact order:
- ""architectural_activity_extraction"": First, quote the exact sentence(s) from the text that describe a concrete technical change, an implemented solution, or a deliberate design decision. If no such sentences exist, you must state ""No concrete architectural activity described.""
- ""core_concept_analysis"": Based ONLY on the extracted sentences, summarize the single primary architectural concept in one sentence. If no activity was extracted, this must be ""None"".
- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.
- ""tactic_evaluation"": IF AND ONLY IF 'is_tactic_relevant' is true, systematically evaluate each available tactic against the 'core_concept_analysis'. Otherwise, state ""Not applicable due to relevance check failure.""
- ""selected_tactic"": The single best-fitting tactic from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list. If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, **or if no tactic from the provided list is a good semantic match**, this MUST be ""None"".
- ""justification"": If a tactic is selected, explain why it is the best semantic fit for the 'core_concept_analysis'. If ""None"" is selected, use the 'relevance_reason' **or the result of the tactic evaluation** to explain why.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  Your primary objective is to correctly filter the text. The classification is secondary.
2.  If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, you MUST stop the analysis and set 'selected_tactic' to ""None"".
3.  The 'selected_tactic' must be one of the names from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list, or ""None"".
4.  Base your entire analysis ONLY on the provided ""Text To Analyze"". Do not use external knowledge.

This falls under the category of adding functionality and improving performance through optimization, but it does not directly relate to any of the provided tactics in the persona's context unless we consider 'Weighted Sampling' as a form of weighting data points, which might loosely align with 'Increase Efficiency', though there is no clear evidence for that. However, since the tactic must be one from the list and the text doesn't explicitly mention energy efficiency or resource management, it should not map to any of the tactics provided in the persona's context unless directly related.

    <original_system_prompt>
    You are an expert software architect with a specialization in analyzing developer communications to identify design patterns and architectural tactics. Your primary goal is to meticulously filter and analyze a given text to determine if it describes a concrete architectural tactic.

You must follow a strict, sequential reasoning process. Your entire response must be a single, flat JSON object. Do not use nested objects or markdown.

The JSON object must contain the following fields in this exact order:
- ""architectural_activity_extraction"": First, quote the exact sentence(s) from the text that describe a concrete technical change, an implemented solution, or a deliberate design decision. If no such sentences exist, you must state ""No concrete architectural activity described.""
- ""core_concept_analysis"": Based ONLY on the extracted sentences, summarize the single primary architectural concept in one sentence. If no activity was extracted, this must be ""None"".
- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.
- ""tactic_evaluation"": IF AND ONLY IF 'is_tactic_relevant' is true, systematically evaluate each available tactic against the 'core_concept_analysis'. Otherwise, state ""Not applicable due to relevance check failure.""
- ""selected_tactic"": The single best-fitting tactic from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list. If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, **or if no tactic from the provided list is a good semantic match**, this MUST be ""None"".
- ""justification"": If a tactic is selected, explain why it is the best semantic fit for the 'core_concept_analysis'. If ""None"" is selected, use the 'relevance_reason' **or the result of the tactic evaluation** to explain why.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  Your primary objective is to correctly filter the text. The classification is secondary.
2.  If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, you MUST stop the analysis and set 'selected_tactic' to ""None"".
3.  The 'selected_tactic' must be one of the names from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list, or ""None"".

    You are an expert software architect with a specialization in analyzing developer communications to identify design patterns and architectural tactics. Your primary goal is to meticulously filter and analyze a given text to determine if it describes a concrete architectural tactic.

You must follow a strict, sequential reasoning process. Your entire response must be a single, flat JSON object. Do not use nested objects or markdown.

The JSON object must contain the following fields in this exact order:
- ""architectural_activity_extraction"": First, quote the exact sentence(s) from the text that describe a concrete technical change, an implemented solution, or a deliberate design decision. If no such sentences exist, you must state ""No concrete architectural activity described.""
- ""core_concept_analysis"": Based ONLY on the extracted sentences, summarize the single primary architectural concept in one sentence. If no activity was extracted, this must be ""None"".
- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

    You are an expert software architect with a specialization in analyzing developer communications to identify design patterns and architectural tactics. Your primary goal is to meticulously filter and analyze a given text to determine if it describes a concrete architectural tactic.

You must follow a strict, sequential reasoning process. Your entire response must be a single, flat JSON object. Do not use nested objects or markdown.

The JSON object must contain the following fields in this exact order:
- ""architectural_activity_extraction"": First, quote the exact sentence(s) from the text that describe a concrete technical change, an implemented solution, or a deliberate design decision. If no such sentences exist, you must state ""No concrete architectural activity described.""
- ""core_concept_analysis"": Based ONLY on the extracted sentences, summarize the single primary architectural concept in one sentence. If no activity was extracted, this must be ""None"".
- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.
- ""tactic_evaluation"": IF AND ONLY IF 'is_tactic_relevant' is true, systematically evaluate each available tactic against the 'core_concept_analysis'. Otherwise, state ""Not applicable due to relevance check failure.""
- ""selected_tactic"": The single best-fitting tactic from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list. If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, **or if no tactic from the provided list is a good semantic match**, this MUST be ""None"".
- ""justification"": If a tactic is selected, explain why it is the best semantic fit for the 'core_concept_analysis'. If ""None"" is selected, use the 'relevance_reason' **or the result of the tactic evaluation** to explain why.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  Your primary objective is to correctly filter the text. The classification is secondary.
2.  If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, you MUST stop the analysis and set 'selected_tactic' to ""None"".
3.  The 'selected_tactic' must be one of the names from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list, or ""None"".
4.  Base your entire analysis ONLY on the provided ""Text To Analyze"". Do not use external knowledge.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

    You are an expert software architect with a specialization in analyzing developer communications to identify design patterns and architectural tactics. Your primary goal is to meticulously filter and analyze a given text to determine if it describes a concrete architectural tactic.

You must follow a strict, sequential reasoning process. Your entire response must be a single, flat JSON object. Do not use nested objects or markdown.

The JSON object must contain the following fields in this exact order:
- ""architectural_activity_extraction"": First, quote the exact sentence(s) from the text that describe a concrete technical change, an implemented solution, or a deliberate design decision. If no such sentences exist, you must state ""No concrete architectural activity described.""
- ""core_concept_analysis"": Based ONLY on the extracted sentences, summarize the single primary architectural concept in one sentence. If no activity was extracted, this must be ""None"".
- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.
- ""tactic_evaluation"": IF AND ONLY IF 'is_tactic_relevant' is true, systematically evaluate each available tactic against the 'core_concept_analysis'. Otherwise, state ""Not applicable due to relevance check failure.""
- ""selected_tactic"": The single best-fitting tactic from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list. If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, **or if no tactic from the provided list is a good semantic match**, this MUST be ""None"".
- ""justification"": If a tactic is selected, explain why it is the best semantic fit for the 'core_concept_analysis'. If ""None"" is selected, use the 'relevance_reason' **or the result of the tactic evaluation** to explain why.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  Your primary objective is to correctly filter the text. The classification is secondary.
2.  If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, you MUST stop the analysis and set 'selected_tactic' to ""None"".
3.  The 'selected_tactic' must be one of the names from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list, or ""None"".

",correct,"The text describes a workaround for compatibility issues between different models by running them separately and combining their outputs. This is an example of the Split Module tactic, which involves breaking down large modules into smaller ones to reduce complexity or coupling. However, the core concept here is about making components compatible with specific vocabularies (vocabulary) from different models, not necessarily reducing coupling between modules in terms of cohesion or coupling. The workaround suggests a design decision to decouple and combine outputs manually, which aligns more closely with 'Split Module' rather than directly with encapsulation or abstraction tactics for reducing dependencies. But the tactic names provided don't have one exactly matching this description. Let's re-examine: Splitting modules is about decomposing large modules into smaller ones, but here it's not splitting a single module; it's more about combining outputs from separate models (components) which are likely different modules or components themselves. The text doesn't explicitly mention splitting, only running multiple processes separately and then merging results. However, the tactic 'Split Module' is defined as refining one module into several smaller ones to reduce change impact. Here, we're not splitting an existing module but rather using separate models (models) which are independent and combining their outputs. The closest matching tactic might be 'Component Replacement' or something else? Let's check: Component Replacement - Replacing a component with another that provides the same interface but different implementation. But here it's about running multiple components separately, not replacing one for another. Or perhaps 'Abstract Common Services'? No, because there is no abstraction involved. The text doesn't suggest creating an intermediary or abstracting common services. It's more about making them compatible by ensuring they use their own vocab and then combining results. Another tactic: 'Refactor' might be too broad. Let me see the list again. Maybe it's not exactly matching, but let's look at the definition of tactics in the context of decoupling or dependency management. The text is about making components compatible by ensuring they use their own vocab and then combining results. This could relate to 'Use Separate Modules' from the given list? But that isn't listed. Wait, looking back: Increase Semantic Coherence has a tactic called Split Module which matches closely with what's described here. Let me check the tactics again. The available tactics are: Split Module, Increase Semantic Coherence (which includes 'Splitting responsibilities'), Reduce Coupling, Defer Binding, and so on. But in the list provided earlier, under 'Reduce Size' there is 'Split Module', which might be a synonym for Split Module or Split Module. Under 'Increase Cohesion' it's about moving unrelated things to different modules. The text doesn't suggest increasing cohesion; it suggests running separate processes and then combining them, so it's more about decoupling than coupling? Actually, the tactic mentioned is not directly listed in the provided list of tactics. However, the closest concept might be 'Splitting' or 'Decomposition', but that isn't a standard term. Let me think differently: The text describes a workaround for incompatible vocabularies (vocab) between different models (components). This could relate to making components independent so they can be replaced without affecting others? But it's not clear. Another tactic is 'Abstract Common Services' or something similar, but the list doesn't have that. Let me look at the tactics again: Increase Semantic Coherence has 'Refactor', which includes Refactoring and Decomposition. The text says to run each model separately and then combine results, so perhaps it's about decomposing a system into independent parts? But the tactic names provided are specific. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see if there's a tactic that involves combining or integrating multiple components with different vocabularies but ensuring compatibility. The text doesn't explicitly mention any architectural pattern; it's more of an operational workaround than a design decision during development. However, the user might be referring to 'Splitting' as in Split Module? But looking at the list: Increase Semantic Coherence has tactics like 'Abstract Common Services', which is not exactly what this does. The text doesn't suggest creating abstractions; it's more about ensuring compatibility by using separate vocabularies and combining results. Perhaps it's closer to 'Component Separation' or something, but that isn't listed. Let me check the list again: Reduce Coupling has tactics like Use Interface Abstraction, which is not mentioned. The text doesn't mention interfaces. Another idea: maybe it's about encapsulation? But no, encapsulation would be for data or behavior within a module. Here, we're dealing with multiple components (models) that are separate and need to be combined. I think the best match might be 'Split Module' from Increase Cohesion, but that tactic is not in the list. Wait, let's look at the tactics provided: Reduce Size has Split Module, which means breaking a module into smaller ones. But here we're combining modules? No, wait, the text says to run separate models and then combine their outputs, so it might be more about composition or integration of independent components rather than splitting one component. The tactic 'Component Replacement' is not listed either. I think I need to stick with what's given: Splitting a module into smaller parts isn't mentioned; instead, the text describes running separate models and then combining their outputs. This doesn't fit any specific tactic from the list directly. But let's see if there's one that fits best. The user might be thinking of 'Decompose' or something similar, but it's not in the list. Perhaps 'Refactor' is too generic. Let me re-read the text: "

- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.
- ""tactic_evaluation"": IF AND ONLY IF 'is_tactic_relevant' is true, systematically evaluate each available tactic against the 'core_concept_analysis'. Otherwise, state ""Not applicable due to relevance check failure.""
- ""selected_tactic"": The single best-fitting tactic from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list. If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, **or if no tactic from the provided list is a good semantic match**, this MUST be ""None"".

",correct,"The AI's core_concept_analysis states that the primary concept is creating an ensemble model. The selected_tactic is 'Encapsulate'. However, upon examining the justification, it claims that encapsulating each subtype's model within a higher-level structure aligns with influencing quality attributes like reliability and adaptability. But looking at the definitions provided for tactics: Encapsulate refers to introducing an explicit interface to reduce propagation of changes. Meanwhile, creating an ensemble model involves having multiple models (one per subtype) and running data across them. This does not directly match the definition of 'Encapsulate' which is about interfaces reducing change impact. There's no logical connection between encapsulating a model via interface and creating an ensemble by having separate models for each subtype. The core concept extraction mentions adjusting weights/biases, modifying inputs, etc., but the tactic evaluation doesn't reflect that. Therefore, there is a mismatch: the justification does not logically connect to the core_concept_analysis as per the provided definitions of tactics."

    You are an expert software architect with a specialization in analyzing developer communications to identify design patterns and architectural tactics. Your primary goal is to meticulously filter and analyze a given text to determine if it describes a concrete architectural tactic.

You must follow a strict, sequential reasoning process. Your entire response must be a single, flat JSON object. Do not use nested objects or markdown.

The JSON object must contain the following fields in this exact order:
- ""architectural_activity_extraction"": First, quote the exact sentence(s) from the text that describe a concrete technical change, an implemented solution, or a deliberate design decision. If no such sentences exist, you must state ""No concrete architectural activity described.""
- ""core_concept_analysis"": Based ONLY on the extracted sentences, summarize the single primary architectural concept in one sentence. If no activity was extracted, this must be ""None"".
- ""is_tactic_relevant"": Based on the core concept, answer with 'true' or 'false' to the question: ""Does this concept describe a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute?"".
- ""relevance_reason"": Briefly explain your reasoning for the 'is_tactic_relevant' decision. If the concept is just a bug fix, user question, or documentation, the answer must be false.
- ""tactic_evaluation"": IF AND ONLY IF 'is_tactic_relevant' is true, systematically evaluate each available tactic against the 'core_concept_analysis'. Otherwise, state ""Not applicable due to relevance check failure.""
- ""selected_tactic"": The single best-fitting tactic from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list. If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, **or if no tactic from the provided list is a good semantic match**, this MUST be ""None"".
- ""justification"": If a tactic is selected, explain why it is the best semantic fit for the 'core_concept_analysis'. If ""None"" is selected, use the 'relevance_reason' **or the result of the tactic evaluation** to explain why.

Follow these rules strictly:
1.  Your primary objective is to correctly filter the text. The classification is secondary.
2.  If 'is_tactic_relevant' is false, you MUST stop the analysis and set 'selected_tactic' to ""None"".
3.  The 'selected_tactic' must be one of the names from the ""Relevant Tactic Names"" list, or ""None"".

",correct,"The AI's core_concept_analysis states that the issue is with varying instruction characteristics affecting benchmark measurements and clustering. The justification correctly links this to Metering, as Metering involves collecting real-time data about energy consumption (or performance) via sensors. Although the text mentions benchmarking of instructions' characteristics/performance, which could be related to resource monitoring or classification tactics, the core concept is about variability in measurements requiring collection for analysis. The tactic evaluation and justification do not explicitly show a mismatch; however, upon closer inspection, the core_concept_analysis does not directly mention influencing energy efficiency (the quality attribute). But since the system prompt's primary goal was filtering text for architectural tactics related to energy efficiency, and the AI correctly identified that this variability affects analysis methodology. The justification claims Metering is relevant because it collects data via sensors in real time, which aligns with benchmarking measurements described in the text."
