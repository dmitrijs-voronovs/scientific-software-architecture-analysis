You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

",High-Level Explanation or Guide,incorrect,"My verdict is incorrect because the ground truth category for this text is High-Level Explanation or Guide, but the first AI's decision to keep it was correct according to its own reasoning. However, upon closer inspection of the source data, I classified it as a High-Level Explanation or Guide since it discusses design choices and trade-offs in the context of Makefile modifications. The AI correctly identified that this text should not be eliminated due to substantial explanatory prose about 'why' aspects (rationale for changes). But wait, let's recheck: according to the Stage 0 filter rubric provided by me as auditor, which prioritizes high-level human discussions and conceptual explanations relevant to software architecture, I must first independently classify. The text is a patch description with technical details but also explains the rationale behind changes (e.g., 'This will facilitate installing fastp via package managers', 'a slightly cleaner way'). It does not contain code snippets in prose form; it's more like a commit message or change log explanation. However, my rubric specifically says to eliminate low-level implementation comments that only describe what without why. This text describes both what (changes to Makefile) and why (rationale for changes). Therefore, I would classify this as 'High-Level Explanation' because it explains the design choices even briefly. The AI's reasoning aligns with my classification: they noted substantial explanatory prose about rationale. But wait, in Step 2 of my verification script, I must compare the first AI's decision with my ground truth category and check if its reasoning is sound. In this case, both match - so why did I say incorrect? Let me think again. The original prompt for the AI was different from mine. As a senior auditor following the Stage 0 filter rubric (which is more restrictive than the core principle in the original prompt), my ground truth classification must be based solely on that rubric. According to the rubric, KEEP categories are: Interactive Communication and High-Level Explanation or Guide. The text here is not interactive communication but a patch description with explanation of changes. It does explain 'why' (rationale for design choices). So I would classify it as High-Level Explanation -> KEEP category. Therefore, correct decision should be to_eliminate: false. And the AI's reasoning correctly supports that. But wait, in my initial response above, I said incorrect because I thought there was a mismatch? Let me reevaluate strictly by the auditor rubric. The text is primarily about changes made to Makefile for software architecture purposes (installation via package managers). It explains design choices and trade-offs briefly. So it fits into High-Level Explanation or Guide -> KEEP category. The AI correctly decided not to eliminate it, so evaluation should be correct. However, in my previous response I concluded incorrect because of a misinterpretation? Let's fix that. Upon reclassification by the auditor rubric: This text is an explanation of changes made for software architecture reasons (portability and simplicity). It discusses design choices ('slightly cleaner way') with rationale. Therefore, it should be kept as per KEEP category High-Level Explanation or Guide. The AI also classified it correctly in their reasoning. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let's correct: the evaluation is correct because both my ground truth classification and the AI's decision align on keeping this text."

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

For example, `failed_quality_filter`, `failed_too_short` etc. * for PE data, if unpaired reads are not stored (by giving --unpaired1 or --unpaired2), the failed pair of reads will be put together. If one read passes the filters but its pair doesn't, the `failure reason` will be `paired_read_is_failing`. process only part of the data. If you don't want to process all the data, you can specify `--reads_to_process` to limit the reads to be processed. This is useful if you want to have a fast preview of the data quality, or you want to create a subset of the filtered data. do not overwrite exiting files. You can enable the option `--dont_overwrite` to protect the existing files not to be overwritten by `fastp`. In this case, `fastp` will report an error and quit if it finds any of the output files (read1, read2, json report, html report) already exists before. split the output to multiple files for parallel processing.

    <sentence>FASTP output fails to align using STAR; Hi, I have tried to trim and filter reads by length using Fastp, but to no avail. . The program runs successfully, but my downstream alignment results is near-zero aligment percentage (using STAR, a popular RNA-seq aligner) . I cannot see any problem in Fastp's output FASTQ format, and using other programs the same samples are successfuly aligned after trimming and length filtering. . Any input on the matter would be appreciated, once this is resolved I would like to incorporate Fastp in all my analysis pipelines.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.

13,"output left aligned variant representation for indels; Hello,. I want to suggest here to left-aligne indel in the DeepVariant output VCF / gVCF to avoid the issue described below. I'm running DeepVariant v1.1.0 on a set of samples sequenced with Illumina 2x150 paired-end reads. My workflow right now includes calling variant using DV and then merge individual gVCFs using GLnexus as described in your best-practices for multi-sample VCF. Inspecting the resulting cohort VCF I've noticed that the representation of indels in repetitive / homopolymer regions is not normalized to the leftmost position and this generates odd situations downstream. Essentially, the multi-sample VCF, would contain 2 different variants that, when left-aligned downstream using for example bcftools norm, become the same locus generating duplicated vars with different genotypes. I didn't notice this issue with recent versions of GATK so I suppose they left-align indels in the output VCF. See the example below:. These are 2 indel variants in my multi-sample VCF:. ```. chr3 105259621 chr3_105259621_T_TTA T TTA. chr3 105259623 chr3_105259623_A_ATA A ATA. ```. As you can see in the screenshot, the actual locus is a repetitive region with TA repeats, so the exact location of a TA insertion in the stretch can not be known. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51458073/134807481-94191333-32bc-4249-ac11-b265711e435e.png). When I apply bcftools norm, it changes the second one to the leftmost position, making it identical to the first one (which is the expected behavior). So in the end I have 2 duplicated vars in my VCF, each with different genotypes: . ```. chr3 105259621 chr3_105259621_T_TTA T TTA. chr3 105259621 chr3_105259623_A_ATA T TTA. ```. This situation creates troubles for downstream analysis and segregation, even if probably most of these variants can be discarded since they are likely artifacts. The problem does not affect many single allele variants (just 51 out of 24054518 in my ","

- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

output left aligned variant representation for indels; Hello,. I want to suggest here to left-aligne indel in the DeepVariant output VCF / gVCF to avoid the issue described below. I'm running DeepVariant v1.1.0 on a set of samples sequenced with Illumina 2x150 paired-end reads. My workflow right now includes calling variant using DV and then merge individual gVCFs using GLnexus as described in your best-practices for multi-sample VCF. Inspecting the resulting cohort VCF I've noticed that the representation of indels in repetitive / homopolymer regions is not normalized to the leftmost position and this generates odd situations downstream. Essentially, the multi-sample VCF, would contain 2 different variants that, when left-aligned downstream using for example bcftools norm, become the same locus generating duplicated vars with different genotypes. I didn't notice this issue with recent versions of GATK so I suppose they left-align indels in the output VCF. See the example below:.

- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

    <reasoning>This text appears to be a system log or performance metrics output from executing bioinformatics tools (trimmomatic and fastp). It contains raw data about resource usage, hardware specifications, software versions, and execution times. There is no substantial explanation of the 'why' or 'how' behind these observations. The final question seems to be asking for an explanation regarding thread limits in algorithms, but it is embedded within a context that describes system configurations and outputs without providing any rationale or discussion about design choices or technical concepts. Since this does not meet Principle #1 (lacking explanatory substance) or Principle #2 (not clear human communication with intent), it should be eliminated as unambiguous noise.</reasoning>

",Low-Level Implementation Comment,incorrect,"My verdict is incorrect because the ground truth category for this text snippet is 'Low-Level Implementation Comment', but the first AI's decision to eliminate was correct, and its reasoning aligns with eliminating it as noise. However, according to the Stage 0 filter rubric, a low-level implementation comment should be eliminated if it lacks explanation of 'why' or 'how'. In this case, the text does contain a question about thread limits in algorithms, which could potentially explain why there is an upper limit of 16 threads (despite being embedded in technical output). The AI's reasoning focused on the lack of substantial explanation elsewhere but missed that the final part has a substantive question. Therefore, while the majority might be noise, the presence of this specific inquiry makes it eligible for keeping under the rubric's tie-breaker principle."

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.
