You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.

The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by in(). For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by setting strm-&gt;next_in and strm-&gt;avail_in. If that input is exhausted, then in() will be called.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

",False,"This text appears to be a compilation log and an error message from the linker during the build process of a program called fastp. It includes multiple g++ commands with flags and source file paths, followed by undefined reference errors for functions like gzbuffer and gzoffset, which are likely related to zlib compression library usage in C++. The final line is a question asking for suggestions on how to fix these errors. This content contains both technical details about the build process (what was compiled) and an error analysis that explains why the compilation failed due to missing references to specific functions from the zlib library. Since it includes explanations of 'why' the build might be failing, specifically pointing out undefined references which implies a potential issue with linking or missing libraries, this qualifies as high-value explanatory text under Principle #1.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 &amp; 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

It also includes context about restoring a GitHub repository version (v0.20.0) with explanatory details regarding the change in policy for future releases. The presence of personal commentary ('I appreciate your help') and specific actions (replying to email, unsubscribing) confirms it is human-authored.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.
