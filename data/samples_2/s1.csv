Deflate is a widely used compression standard that can be used standalone, it also forms the basis of gzip and zlib compression formats. Igzip supports the following flush features: No Flush: The default method where no special flush is performed. Sync flush: whereby isal_deflate() finishes the current deflate block at the end of each input buffer. The deflate block is byte aligned by appending an empty stored block. Full flush: whereby isal_deflate() finishes and aligns the deflate block as in sync flush but also ensures that subsequent block's history does not look back beyond this point and new blocks are fully independent. Igzip also supports compression levels from ISAL_DEF_MIN_LEVEL to ISAL_DEF_MAX_LEVEL. Igzip contains some behavior configurable at compile time. These configurable options are: IGZIP_HIST_SIZE - Defines the window size. The default value is 32K (note K represents 1024), but 8K is also supported. Powers of 2 which are at most 32K may also work. LONGER_HUFFTABLES - Defines whether to use a larger hufftables structure which may increase performance with smaller IGZIP_HIST_SIZE values.

63,security,"Hi @ekofman , . thanks for reporting this! It seems like you're using the example from the WGS case study. From my experience, suppose you on a 4-core machine, if you specify a $numShards bigger than 4 (say, 64), `parallel` will actually still just run 4 at a time. Therefore, it might run 0-3 first. And when they finished, `parallel` will proceed with the range of 4-7, etc. Because of that, if you run 64 shards on 4-core machine, you won't see all 64 jobs started at the same time. Can you first confirm whether that's the case for you? . In your case, if somehow all 64 `make_examples` started on the same machine that 4 cores, it is possible that the machine starts becoming resource constrained and swapping a lot, therefore nothing will finish. But the first thing will be to check whether `parallel` handles this for you (which is my experience in the past). @ekofman , please let me know what you observe. And, it'll also be useful to know how many cores are on your machine, and how much RAM. If you can check your system resources while you're running to see what resource might be exhausted, that will also be useful to know. If your BAM file is sharable / public, I'm also happy to run a few test runs myself. I expect changing $numShards should work, so I'd really like to know what went wrong here and fix it. Thanks! The GCP runner code that @pgrosu mentioned is actually a separate example. The GCP runner config is evolving over time as well, so it's by no means the best (or only) config that we recommend. But it's a useful example to see how to orchestrate these jobs on multiple machines on Google Cloud.

By trying out the new version you can help us. converge quickly to a stable version that can then become the new. pro version. If you are a new user we would advice you to try the. new version. - The *pro* (production) version is a version we feel comfortable with. to exposing to a large audience for serious work. The change rate of. this version is much lower than for the new version, it is about 3. to 6 months. - The *old* version is the previous pro version that people might need. for some time before switching the new pro version. The old change. rate is the same as for pro. Installing Precompiled Binaries. The binaries are available for downloading from. <https://root.cern/install/>.

The default integration engine for the numeric convolution is the adaptive Gauss-Kronrod method, which empirically seems the most robust for this task. You can override the convolution integration settings via the RooNumIntConfig object reference returned by the convIntConfig() member function By default the numeric convolution is integrated from -infinity to +infinity through a <pre>x -> 1/x</pre> coordinate transformation of the tails. For convolution with a very small bandwidth it may be advantageous (for both CPU consumption and stability) if the integration domain is limited to a finite range. The function setConvolutionWindow(mean,width,scale) allows to set a sliding window around the x value to be calculated taking a RooAbsReal expression for an offset and a width to be taken around the x value. These input expression can be RooFormulaVars or other function objects although the 3d scale argument scale multiplies the width RooAbsReal expression given in the 2nd argument, allowing for an appropriate window definition for most cases without need for a RooFormulaVar object: e.g. a Gaussian resolution PDF do setConvolutionWindow(gaussMean,gaussSigma,5) Note that for a wide Gaussian the -inf to +inf integration may converge more quickly than that over a finite range!

This simplifies handling of C++ scope specifiers and allows efficient backtracking without the need to re-parse and resolve nested-names and typenames. It will mainly be called when we expect to treat identifiers as typenames (if they are typenames). For example, in C we do not expect identifiers inside expressions to be treated as typenames so it will not be called for expressions in C. The benefit for C/ObjC is that a typename will be annotated and Actions.getTypeName will not be needed to be called again (e.g. getTypeName will not be called twice, once to check whether we have a declaration specifier, and another one to get the actual type inside ParseDeclarationSpecifiers).

""TryAnnotateTypeOrScopeToken - If the current token position is on a typename (possibly qualified in C++) or a C++ scope specifier not followed by a typename, TryAnnotateTypeOrScopeToken will replace one or more tokens with a single annotation token representing the typename or C++ scope respectively. This simplifies handling of C++ scope specifiers and allows efficient backtracking without the need to re-parse and resolve nested-names and typenames. It will mainly be called when we expect to treat identifiers as typenames (if they are typenames). For example, in C we do not expect identifiers inside expressions to be treated as typenames so it will not be called for expressions in C. The benefit for C/ObjC is that a typename will be annotated and Actions.getTypeName will not be needed to be called again (e.g. getTypeName will not be called twice, once to check whether we have a declaration specifier, and another one to get the actual type inside ParseDeclarationSpecifiers). This returns true if an error occurred. Note that this routine emits an error if you call it with ::new or ::delete as the current tokens, so only call it in contexts where these are invalid.""

""Compile macro inside temp build directory; Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. Compiled libraries of a ROOT macro often end up in the same folder, taking some extra space, and I remove then later by hand to avoid polluting too much source code directories. It makes also files in a folder with many scripts, harder to found, as two of every three is dummy (.so, .d). Describe the solution you'd like. It would be nice to have an option or flag t in [TSystem::CompileMacro](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTSystem.html#ac557d8f24d067a9b89d2b8fb261d7e18) that automatically:. - Outputs the compiled macro to the default temp directory using [std::temp_directory_path](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/temp_directory_path). - It gives this file a hash-generated filename that is path-specific, to avoid that two macros called the same way overwrite each other. . The easiest way for this would be to remove all slashes from the full filename and transforms it to underscores. For example: . `root -l my/full/path/to/folder/my_macro.C+t`. should give:. `/tmp/my_full_path_to_folder_my_macro.C_so`. Or alternatively, if a new flag is not wanted, that this could be specified via the rootrc. Also, if /tmp/ is not wanted, it could maybe be instead a user-config directory (https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10148). Describe alternatives you've considered. Using. `gSystem->SetBuildDir(""/tmp/"");`. in my `rootlogon.C`. But this does not solve the overwrite problem.

For comparison, you can see what is reported from precisionFDA (when running DeepVariant on my samples) for the [provided .bam alignment](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3435) or the [BWA-MEM re-aligned comparison](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3436). There are two numbers because a “*partial*” recovery just checks for the presence of a variant (either heterozygous or homozygous). Due to formatting differences (such as with indels), I didn’t feel comfortable showing comparisons between variant callers on my page with notes/code on my [Genos Exome sample](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Genos_Exome), but I think this is OK when using the same variant caller on different samples.

That said, I found the comment about backward compat of *ABI* strange. The backward compatibility of _API_ is indeed more appealing (assuming we don't want to make this an internal API completely). To keep the API compatible, we can always provide both the old and new API (where the old implementation is just a shim to the new API).

In addition to the distinction between function and module passes, passes can be. divided into transform and analysis passes.

We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) specifically in thymic T cells. The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.","

This means that, with effort, the LLVM. optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code. * LLVM debug information does not prevent optimizations from. happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,. tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of. the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate. information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information. is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with. ``-O0 -g`` and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify. the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with. ``-O3 -g`` gives you full debug information that is always available and. accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call. elimination and inlining), but you might l""

For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects. and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost. Similarly, this is why pybind11 is so slow: its code generation is the C++. compiler's template engine, so complex path selection and specialization is. very hard to do in a performance-portable way. In cppyy, a great deal of attention has gone into built-in specialization. paths, which drives its performance. For example, basic inheri""

""Set the internal buffer size used by this library's functions. The default buffer size is 8192 bytes. This function must be called after gzopen() or gzdopen(), and before any other calls that read or write the file. The buffer memory allocation is always deferred to the first read or write. Two buffers are allocated, either both of the specified size when writing, or one of the specified size and the other twice that size when reading. A larger buffer size of, for example, 64K or 128K bytes will noticeably increase the speed of decompression (reading). The new buffer size also affects the maximum length for gzprintf(). gzbuffer() returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure, such as being called too late.""

116,interoperability,"o the. source code. MC/DC Instrumentation. ---------------------. When instrumenting for Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) using the. clang option ``-fcoverage-mcdc``, users are limited to at most **six** leaf-level. conditions in a boolean expression. A warning will be generated for boolean. expressions that contain more than six, and they will not be instrumented for. MC/DC. Also, if a boolean expression is embedded in the nest of another boolean. expression but separated by a non-logical operator, this is also not supported. For example, in ``x = (a && b && c && func(d && f))``, the ``d && f`` case. starts a new boolean expression that is separated from the other conditions by. the operator ``func()``. When this is encountered, a warning will be generated. and the boolean expression will not be instrumented. Switch statements. -----------------. The region mapping for a switch body consists of a gap region that covers the. entire body (starting from the { in switch (...) {', and terminating where the. last case ends). This gap region has a zero count: this causes gap areas in. between case statements, which contain no executable code, to appear uncovered. When a switch case is visited, the parent region is extended: if the parent. region has no start location, its start location becomes the start of the case.

""o the. source code. MC/DC Instrumentation. ---------------------. When instrumenting for Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) using the. clang option ``-fcoverage-mcdc``, users are limited to at most **six** leaf-level. conditions in a boolean expression. A warning will be generated for boolean. expressions that contain more than six, and they will not be instrumented for. MC/DC. Also, if a boolean expression is embedded in the nest of another boolean. expression but separated by a non-logical operator, this is also not supported. For example, in ``x = (a && b && c && func(d && f))``, the ``d && f`` case. starts a new boolean expression that is separated from the other conditions by. the operator ``func()``. When this is encountered, a warning will be generated. and the boolean expression will not be instrumented. Switch statements. -----------------. The region mapping for a switch body consists of a gap region that covers the. entire body (starting from the { in switch (...) {', and terminating where the. last case ends). This gap region has a zero count: this causes gap areas in. between case statements, which contain no executable code, to appear uncovered. When a switch case is visited, the parent region is extended: if the parent. region has no start location, its start location becomes the start of the case. This is used to support switch statements without a ``CompoundStmt`` body, in. which the switch body and the single case share a count. For switches with ``CompoundStmt`` bodies, a new region is created at the start. of each switch case. Branch regions are also generated for each switch case, including the default. case.
