We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) specifically in thymic T cells. The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.","

Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection.

These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates.

I could train a NER model for spacy's en_core_web_lg pipeline using the generated config file, but I ran into this error when I used the config file for en_core_sci_lg:. ✔ Created output directory: en_core_sci_lg_model. ℹ Saving to output directory: en_core_sci_lg_model. ℹ Using CPU. =========================== Initializing pipeline ===========================. /home/boognish/mambaforge/envs/microsporidia_nlp/lib/python3.9/site-packages/spacy/util.py:865: UserWarning: [W095] Model en_core_sci_lg (0.5.0) was trained with spaCy v3.2 and may not be 100% compatible with the current version (3.4.1).

These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string.

""Hi, so this is an issue with something I have done wrong with including the vocab file that I haven't had time to figure out properly. That being said, we should be able to work around it.

After doing those two things you should have the missing file, and be able to continue. Hopefully I'll figure out the correct solution at some point, but please do let me know if this works for you or not. Side note: I notice a warning about using different versions of spacy. You should make sure the version of spacy you are using is the right version for the version of scispacy you are using. So, either upgrade scispacy or downgrade spacy.""

DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA.

Currently, two defaults are available:. > - Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). > - Medical Subject Headings (MESH). But the readme lists a few other ontologies as well (and they do seem to be handled in the code). Second higher level question: I'm interested in your reasons for using specifically 3-gram tf-idf vectorization for ANN for candidate generation? Did you publish a paper or something I could read? I would like to experiment with using pre-trained word embeddings instead, but it seems like a rather obvious idea, so I'm curious if there are reasons you didn't do that in the first place? Related to that, if I wanted to generate an index based on word embeddings - how expensive is the generation of the ANN index?

""Entity Linker - documentation issues and questions; Hello,. I am experimenting with the entity linkers and I have a couple of questions/comments. If you prefer I can make separate issues for each of them but I think it's clearer to have a single issue. First small question: Is the documentation for the linkers and candidate generators outdated? The docstring for CandidateGenerator says. > A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available:. > - Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). > - Medical Subject Headings (MESH). But the readme lists a few other ontologies as well (and they do seem to be handled in the code). Second higher level question: I'm interested in your reasons for using specifically 3-gram tf-idf vectorization for ANN for candidate generation? Did you publish a paper or something I could read? I would like to experiment with using pre-trained word embeddings instead, but it seems like a rather obvious idea, so I'm curious if there are reasons you didn't do that in the first place? Related to that, if I wanted to generate an index based on word embeddings - how expensive is the generation of the ANN index? I only have limited computing capabilities available, and the default value for the number of threads in https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/3d153ddad1f11f000f961f7a92c0d862b93c0973/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L396. > num_threads = 60 set based on the machine. Worries me a little. I don't want to spend a lot of time preparing this only to find out that the training is way too expensive to be done in a reasonable time. Thanks in advance!""

""An FASTA reader backed by in-memory ReferenceSequence protos. FASTA files store information about DNA/RNA/Amino Acid sequences: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format An InMemoryFastaReader provides the same API as GenomeReferenceFAI but doesn't fetch its data from an on-disk FASTA file but rather fetches the bases from an in-memory cache containing ReferenceSequence protos. In particular the GetBases(Range(chrom, start, end)) operation fetches bases from the tuple where chrom == chromosome, and then from the bases where the first base of bases starts at start. If start > 0, then the bases string is assumed to contain bases starting from that position in the region. For example, the record ('1', 10, ACGT') implies that GetBases(ranges.make_range('1', 11, 12)) will return the base C', as the A base is at position 10. This makes it straightforward to cache a small region of a full chromosome without having to store the entire chromosome sequence in memory (potentially big!).""

The paper we compare against (https://aclanthology.org/P18-1010.pdf) uses a different string similarity measure for the candidate generation. Character trigram similarity is a pretty common string similarity measure, which is why we choose to use it. The intention is really that a further entity linker that takes into account the context of the mention rather than just the mention string itself should be used.

Figure 3 shows the recall curve as we increase the number of candidates with our candidate generator. We did not dive into what remains in that last bit of recall and whether word embeddings could help. The paper we compare against (https://aclanthology.org/P18-1010.pdf) uses a different string similarity measure for the candidate generation. Character trigram similarity is a pretty common string similarity measure, which is why we choose to use it. The intention is really that a further entity linker that takes into account the context of the mention rather than just the mention string itself should be used. If I were going to experiment, I would probably start by experimenting with reranking the candidates we generate to increase precision, rather than improving the candidate generator to increase recall. 3. Sorry, I don't really remember the compute profile of creating the index. We use nmslib (https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) though, so you might be able to find some more information there.""

The solution described (`nmslib_knn_with_zero_vectors`) is a wrapper that addresses the issue of zero vectors causing crashes.

However, without more details about what `nmslib_knn_with_zero_vectors` does internally, it's hard to say if this is an architectural mechanism specifically for integrability or just a bug fix.","The text states that the wrapper addresses the issue of crashes caused by zero vectors. While it doesn't explicitly state *how* (e.g., by validating inputs, transforming them, etc.), there's an implicit causal link: the problem is that `ann_index.knnQueryBatch` crashes with zero vectors, and the solution (`nmslib_knn_with_zero_vectors`) prevents this crash by handling those cases appropriately. This link is direct enough to consider it evidence of a mechanism.","The rubric for integrability states: 'ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined'. The described mechanism (`nmslib_knn_with_zero_vectors` as a wrapper) suggests that the system has designed an interface or abstraction layer to handle problematic inputs from one component (the `ann_index.knnQueryBatch`) when used by other parts of the system. This reduces direct coupling and makes it easier to combine components without immediate crashes, thus supporting integrability.",True,"The text describes a specific solution (`nmslib_knn_with_zero_vectors` wrapper) that addresses a problem (crash with zero vectors). While not explicitly detailed as an architectural mechanism for integrability, the existence of this wrapper demonstrates a design choice to isolate and handle failures from one component when used by others.

The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased. Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta, IL-8, and MCP-1 in leukocytes. Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI.","

To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased. Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta, IL-8, and MCP-1 in leukocytes. Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI.","

70,security,"Induction of cytokine expression in leukocytes by binding of thrombin-stimulated platelets. BACKGROUND: Activated platelets tether and activate myeloid leukocytes. To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased. Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta, IL-8, and MCP-1 in leukocytes. Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI.","

The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus.

The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.","

Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.""

To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased.

We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) specifically in thymic T cells. The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.","

""Payload Management APIs (Cloned from absl::Status) A payload may be attached to a status to provide additional context to an error that may not be satisfied by an existing `tsl::error::Code`. Typically, this payload serves one of several purposes: It may provide more fine-grained semantic information about the error to facilitate actionable remedies. It may provide human-readable contexual information that is more appropriate to display to an end user. A payload consists of a [key,value] pair, where the key is a string referring to a unique type URL and the value is an object of type `absl::Cord` to hold the contextual data. The type URL should be unique and follow the format of a URL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) and, ideally, provide some documentation or schema on how to interpret its associated data.

28,energy efficiency,"Defective survival and activation of thymocytes in transgenic mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV. We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) specifically in thymic T cells. The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.","

Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.""

To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation.

Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1.

It's not really a problem that 0.2.4 contains them (just a miscommunication between Daniel and I), and maybe it's actually a good thing given this problem. 2. https://support.prodi.gy/t/error-assigning-label-id-when-combining-custom-ner-model-from-prodigy-with-spacy-dependency-parsing-model/1444/2 This seems to be a similar problem. Basically what I think is happening is that spacy assumes that all NER labels are in the vocabulary - here they are not, because the vocabs are different. You might find that just adding the literal strings the NER model needs for its labels to the vocabulary of the one for the parser/tagger works.""

To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased.

I read your [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07669) and I'm excited that the rule-based segmenter module is not usually needed due to the in-domain dependency parser training. However, I noticed some recurrent errors that I want to share with you, since they occur on the aforementioned, widely used BioNLP corpus. I collected many examples that I'm reporting here, and that can be summarized as:. - Oversplitting after +/- or at the dot in p50.c-rel"". - Undersplitting after a capital letter followed by a dot (e.g., kappa B., kinase A., Cya.). You can also find attached a list of other less common errors I screened ([other_errors.txt](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/files/3111859/other_errors.txt)), but I think even just identify a solution for and/or handling these cases would be great since they represent the majority of errors (~75%) in the BioNLP09 corpus! . What would you recommend for handling these cases? Are they easily manageable by adding tokenization rules or you suggest to have a custom module to workaround the problem? Thank you very much indeed! Alan. _____. **Oversplitting after +/-""**. Example 1. - PDBu + iono induced equally high IL-2 levels in both groups and, when stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the IL-2 secretion by neonatal cells was undetectable and adult cells produced low amounts of IL-2 (mean 331 +/-. - 86 pg/ml). Example 2. - The addition of anti-CD28 mAb to anti-CD3-stimulated cells markedly increased IL-2 production in both cell types, but levels of IL-2 in neonatal T cells remained clearly lower than those of adult T cells (respective mean values: 385 +/-. - 109 pg/ml and 4494 +/-. - 1199 pg/ml).

",The text is describing a solution (a mechanism) that involves adding a Makefile shell for generating components. It also mentions using `cached_path` and storing data in an S3 bucket as part of ensuring availability.,"This describes an architectural mechanism because it talks about implementing a specific pattern to handle the absence of data downloads, which is designed to achieve resilience (a quality attribute). The mention of `cached_path` function indicates a design choice for handling potential failures in data access.","The link between the mechanism and availability is direct. By storing all necessary data in an S3 bucket and using `cached_path`, the system avoids having to download data, which could be a point of failure (e.g., network issues). This reduces the chance of outages due to missing or unavailable data sources.","The described mechanism matches the Inclusion Criteria for availability. Specifically, it aligns with 'Caching for Resilience' because `cached_path` is used to retrieve cached data from an S3 bucket when needed, ensuring that even if primary data sources are down or unavailable, the system can still access necessary data through caching.",True,"The text describes a mechanism (using `cached_path` and storing data in an S3 bucket) explicitly designed to prevent availability issues by avoiding direct downloads. This matches the Inclusion Criteria for 'Caching for Resilience' as it ensures system operation even if primary sources are unavailable, thus addressing the quality attribute of availability directly."
