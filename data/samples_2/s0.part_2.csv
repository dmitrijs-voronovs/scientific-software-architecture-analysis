For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. duplication rate evaluation. By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_accuracy level | hash buffer number | buffer size | memory usage | speed | |. |- | - | - | - | - | - |. | 1 | 1 | 1G | 1G | ultra-fast | default for no-dedup mode |. | 2 | 1 | 2G | 2G | fast | |. | 3 | 2 | 2G | 4G | fast | default for dedup|. | 4 | 2 | 4G | 8G | fast | |. | 5 | 2 | 8G | 12G | fast | |. | 6 | 3 | 8G | 24G | moderate | |. deduplication.

",False,"This appears to be a list of features or tasks being addressed in the context of genetic data processing (likely referring to bioinformatics tools). While it is structured as bullet points, each item describes an action ('Revise overlap detection', 'PE correction', etc.) that requires explanation. The phrase 'Support average quality score filter' and 'Count polyX' suggest technical implementation details which may be part of a design discussion or code documentation explaining the rationale behind these changes. However, without explicit context about why these features are being implemented (e.g., to improve accuracy, efficiency, etc.), it is ambiguous whether this constitutes an explanation.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.
