Core Concept: A mechanism for capturing exceptions in code execution (specifically wrapping main() functions) to handle them by exiting without stacktraces, while allowing other exceptions to propagate normally. This is a deliberate design decision intended to influence error handling behavior and program exit conditions.

Available Tactics:
- Split Module
- Increase Semantic Coherence
- Encapsulate
- Use an Intermediary
- Restrict Dependencies
- Refactor
- Abstract Common Services
- Component Replacement
- Compile-time Parameterization
- Aspects
- Configuration-time Binding
- Resource Files
- Runtime Registration
- Dynamic Lookup
- Interpret Parameters
- Startup Time Binding
- Name Servers
- Plug-ins
- Publish-Subscribe
- Shared Repositories
- Polymorphism

Evaluating each tactic:
1. Split Module: This involves dividing a module into smaller ones, which doesn't match the described activity of wrapping code to handle exceptions.
2. Increase Semantic Coherence: Focuses on moving responsibilities for better cohesion, not directly related to exception handling or program exit control.
3. Encapsulate: Involves introducing an interface to reduce propagation of changes, but here we're dealing with explicit exception handling and program termination, which is more about error management than encapsulation.
4. Use an Intermediary: Aims to break dependencies by using a mediator, not directly applicable to the described context manager for exceptions.
5. Restrict Dependencies: About controlling module interactions, unrelated to this specific exception wrapping mechanism.
6. Refactor: General term for restructuring code without changing behavior significantly; while this could be seen as a refactor, it's more specifically about error handling and exit control than general refactoring tactics.
7. Abstract Common Services: Involves creating abstract services once, not relevant to the described exception-based program termination mechanism.
8. Component Replacement: Binding values at compile time or build time by replacing components; this is about value binding, while our text describes a function that wraps code and handles exceptions differently.
9. Compile-time Parameterization: Binds values at compile time through parameters; again, focused on configuration rather than the described exception handling mechanism.
10. Aspects: A cross-cutting concern technique for modularizing concerns like logging or security, not directly matching this specific context manager approach to exceptions.
11. Configuration-time Binding: Involves binding values at deployment time through config files; our text doesn't mention configuration but rather a tuple of allowed_exceptions and an exit value, which is more about runtime decision based on exception type.",None,"The core concept analysis describes a specific mechanism for handling exceptions by wrapping code to capture certain exceptions and exit without stacktraces. This does not directly match any of the provided tactics from the 'Reduce Size of a Module', 'Increase Cohesion', or 'Defer Binding' categories. While it could be argued that this is a form of encapsulation (by limiting its use to main() and providing controlled access), the primary intent here is exception handling, which isn't covered by any tactic in the list. The tactics provided are mostly about modularization, dependency restriction, or deferring bindings for configuration values, but not specifically for managing exceptions with program termination as described."

In such cases, Deepvariant has a tendency to ditch apparently at random (Sample1 Chrom3:20456 called, Sample2 same position not called, despite obvious evidence from mapping and support from long reads). Probably because it didn't learn what to do with so many SNPs. You know the issue because of your mosquito blog spot. And I have seen other issues (including mine) talking about that. The issue is to have a gold standard like in human, or trio data like in the mosquito, you need specific conditions, it seems difficult to imagine this could be doable with, let's say, a deep sea coral (just random example, I don't actually know what's their genome like). . Could a synthetic dataset help here? What if we feed Deepvariant a genome we made up based on what we can observed visually? I am aware if we make an error it will learn errors, but I wanted your opinion, because the lack of high quality reference dataset for many species, seems to be a serious limitation for this kind of program. Thanks a lot. Since it's not the first time I bring this out, I understand if you would simply close this. Have a good week everyone.""

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

This is necessary because the labeling algorithm is very expensive as a function of the number of input variants, so to avoid excessive runtime we break up our potentially large list of candidate and truth variants into smaller groups (max number controlled by max_group_size) based on a maximum distance allowed between the closest variants within the group. The current algorithm is a simple greedy one; we effectively merge the two variant lists together, make groups greedily on that list until either the maximum number of elements of a specific type (i.e., max_group_size of 2 implies we can have up to two candidate variants or truth variants within a group) or we encounter a variant further away from the closest variant within the current group than allowed by max_separation. Args: candidates: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of candidate variants on the same chromosome. truths: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of truth variants on the same chromosome. max_group_size: int >= 0. The maximum number of variants of a specific type allowed within a group. max_separation: int >= 0. The maximum distance, in basepairs, allowed between the closest variants within a group. max_gt_options_product: int >= 0. The maximum number of combinations of genotypes (product of all genotypes in the group). force_group_within_bp: int >= 0. Variants within this many bps will be forced to be put in the same group. This is to ensure that we do not decouple candidates and truths in variant-dense regions. This value can be set to -1 for unit-test purposes. Setting -1 will not force any grouping of variants.

This is necessary because the labeling algorithm is very expensive as a function of the number of input variants, so to avoid excessive runtime we break up our potentially large list of candidate and truth variants into smaller groups (max number controlled by max_group_size) based on a maximum distance allowed between the closest variants within the group. The current algorithm is a simple greedy one; we effectively merge the two variant lists together, make groups greedily on that list until either the maximum number of elements of a specific type (i.e., max_group_size of 2 implies we can have up to two candidate variants or truth variants within a group) or we encounter a variant further away from the closest variant within the current group than allowed by max_separation. Args: candidates: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of candidate variants on the same chromosome. truths: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of truth variants on the same chromosome. max_group_size: int >= 0. The maximum number of variants of a specific type allowed within a group. max_separation: int >= 0. The maximum distance, in basepairs, allowed between the closest variants within a group. max_gt_options_product: int >= 0. The maximum number of combinations of genotypes (product of all genotypes in the group). force_group_within_bp: int >= 0. Variants within this many bps will be forced to be put in the same group. This is to ensure that we do not decouple candidates and truths in variant-dense regions. This value can be set to -1 for unit-test purposes. Setting -1 will not force any grouping of variants. Returns: A list of grouped variants in 2-tuples, such as: [(candidates1, truth_variants1), ...] where each tuple contains the candidate and truth variants for that group. Raises: ValueError: if any of the inputs are malformed.""

## Text To Analyze:
""Checkpointing / resuming analysis; **Have you checked the FAQ? https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/docs/FAQ.md**:. **Describe the issue:**. I am struggling to get DeepTrio to run to completion on a small dataset. It completes at the end of call_variants.py but my system just collapses when at postprocess_variants. Through using --dry_run=true, I'm able to keep going only after being sufficiently confident the last step has completed without error. So in short, is it possible to re-run the wrapper command and have the analysis pipeline pick up where it left off? . **Setup**. - Operating system: Rocky Linux 8. - DeepVariant version: 1.6. - Installation method (Docker, built from source, etc.): through Docker. - Type of data: (sequencing instrument, reference genome, anything special that is unlike the case studies?) illumina, 151bp, same reference as case studies. - RAM 64 GB. - CPUs 32 (c6i.8xlarge). **Steps to reproduce:**. - Command:. - Error trace: (if applicable). **Does the quick start test work on your system?** Yes they do. they complete because they are small. . Please test with https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.10/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md. Is there any way to reproduce the issue by using the quick start? **Any additional context:**. Unfortunately, i cant run it on g4dn.8xlarge available to me since that EC2 running Amazon Linux 2, and GPU DeepVariant seems to need Ubuntu. In short, a step_x_completed sentinel file at end of each step would be great IMO. . Thanks,. -Daniel""

This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.

- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""Samples k elements with uniform probability from an iterable. Selects a subset of k elements from n input elements with uniform probability without needing to hold all n elements in memory at the same time. This implementation has max space complexity O(min(k, n)), i.e., we allocate up to min(k, n) elements to store the samples. This means that we only use ~n elements when n is smaller than k, which can be important when k is large. If n elements are added to this sampler, and n <= k, all n elements will be retained. If n > k, each added element will be retained with a uniform probability of k / n. The order of the k retained samples from our n elements is undefined. In particular that means that the elements in the returned list can occur in a different order than they appeared in the iterable. More details about reservoir sampling (and the specific algorithm used here called Algorithm R) can be found on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling#Algorithm_R Args: iterable: Python iterable.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start with gz"". The gzip format is different from the zlib format. gzip is a gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream. This library can optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well. The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory and on communications channels. The gzip format was designed for single- file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib. The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash even in case of corrupted input.""

- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction

- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

"" gVCF files as output from DeepVariant [[doc](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.5/docs/deepvariant-gvcf-support.md)]:. gVCF files are required as input for analyses that create a set of variants in a cohort of individuals, such as cohort merging or joint genotyping. 1. Training data:. All models are trained with a benchmarking-compatible strategy: That is, *we never train on any data from the HG002 sample, or from chromosome 20 from any sample.*. * Whole genome sequencing model:. We used training data from both genome sequencing data as well as exome sequencing data. - WGS data:. - HG001: 1 from PrecisionFDA, and 8 replicates from Verily. - HG005: 2 from Verily. - WES data:. - HG001: 11 HiSeq2500, 17 HiSeq4000, 50 NovaSeq. - HG005: 1 from Oslo University. In order to increase diversity of training data, we also used the `downsample_fraction` flag when making training examples. * Whole exome sequencing model:. We started from a trained WGS model as a checkpoint, then we continue to train only on WES data above. We also use various downsample fractions for the training data. 1. DeepVariant now provides deterministic output by rounding QUAL field to one digit past the decimal when writing to VCF. 1. Update the model input data representation from 7 channels to 6. * Removal of Op-Len (CIGAR operation length) as a model feature. In our tests this makes the model more robust to input that has different read lengths. * Added [an example for visualizing examples](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.5/docs/visualizing_examples.ipynb). 1. Add a post-processing step to variant calls to eliminate rare inconsistent haplotypes [[description](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.5/deepvariant/haplotypes.py#L29-L41)]. 1. Expand the excluded contigs list to include common problematic contigs on GRCh38 [[GitHub issue](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/37)]. 1. It is now possible to run [DeepVariant workflows on GCP](https://cloud.google.com""

- Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules, so it doesn't fit.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: This involves moving responsibilities to different modules. Here, the change is about modifying input data representation and features, which isn't directly about responsibility shifting or module boundaries.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction mentioned.
- Use an Intermediary: Not using any intermediary for binding values.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text doesn't restrict dependencies; it's more about what data is used.
- Refactor: This involves factoring out common responsibilities. The change described (removing Op-Len, changing channels) could be seen as refactoring the model by simplifying its input features and training strategy.
- Abstract Common Services: Not mentioned in the text; no abstract services created.

From Reduce Coupling tactics:
- Component Replacement: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement. The change is about data representation, not binding values.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Again, about parameterizing at compile time, which isn't what's described here.
- Aspects: Not applicable as no aspect-based approach mentioned.

- Runtime Registration: Not runtime binding of values.
- Dynamic Lookup: Not used.
- Interpret Parameters: Not interpreting parameters at runtime.
- Startup Time Binding: Not binding during startup.
- Name Servers: No name servers involved.

- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.

- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

",Otherwise you get corrupt cache entries if the download gets interrupted.,"The primary architectural concept is a method for handling incomplete or corrupted downloads by ensuring that files are only copied to the cache after full completion, thus preventing corruption due to partial transfers.",True,This concept addresses fault tolerance and data integrity by implementing a mechanism to avoid corrupting the system's cache with partially downloaded files. It is intended to influence quality attributes such as reliability and availability.,"Evaluating against the core concept: The text describes a method for ensuring that cached entries are not corrupted during interrupted downloads. This involves checking the completion of an operation before proceeding, which aligns with tactics focused on fault detection or prevention. Specifically, it resembles 'Condition Monitoring' (which checks conditions to prevent faults) and 'Exception Prevention' (preventing exceptions by ensuring proper handling). However, Condition Monitoring is more about ongoing system health checks, while this text describes a specific recovery step for incomplete operations. It also relates to 'Retry', but the text does not explicitly mention retrying; it focuses on avoiding corruption. The closest match might be 'Condition Monitoring' or 'Exception Prevention'. But let's compare with all relevant tactics.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

",An **error** will not appear when these are mismatched because of how InceptionV3 works.,"The warning message indicates that the input image height is not matching between different components, and it explains that this discrepancy does not cause an error due to the way InceptionV3 operates.",True,The concept involves a deliberate design decision related to fault handling by specifying conditions under which errors do not appear despite mismatches in input parameters. This influences system quality attributes such as reliability and correctness.,"Evaluating the core concept against relevant tactics:
- The core concept is about how an error does not occur due to a mismatch, specifically mentioning InceptionV3.
  - Checking 'Ping/Echo': Not mentioned or related.
  - Checking 'Monitor': No mention of monitoring components.
  - Checking 'Heartbeat': No heartbeat mechanism described.
  - Checking 'Timestamp': No timestamp usage for fault detection.
  - Checking 'Sanity Checking': The warning is about input validation, which could be a form of sanity checking but not explicitly stated as such in the text.
  - Checking 'Condition Monitoring': Not directly related to monitoring conditions; it's more about handling discrepancies.
  - Checking 'Voting': No voting logic involved.
  - Checking 'Exception Detection': The warning is detecting an input mismatch, which could be considered exception detection but not explicitly called out as a tactic in the text.
  - Checking 'Self-Test': Not mentioned; no self-testing of components.

Relevant tactics for fault handling include: Active Redundancy, Passive Redundancy, Spare, Exception Handling, Rollback, Retry, Ignore Faulty Behavior, Degradation, Reconfiguration. The core concept is about the absence of an error due to a mismatch in input parameters and how InceptionV3 handles it.

Looking at 'Exception Handling': It involves handling detected exceptions using information to mask the fault. Here, there's no explicit mechanism for masking or handling the exception; instead, the warning points out that errors don't appear because of the design (InceptionV3).

'Ignore Faulty Behavior': This tactic calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious. The core concept is not about ignoring faulty behavior but rather about how the system does not produce an error due to mismatched parameters.

'Self-Test': Components can run procedures to test themselves, which doesn't match as there's no self-testing mentioned.

'Predictive Model': Used with monitors for predictive fault handling, not applicable here.

The core concept is about the system's behavior in the face of a mismatch: it does not produce an error. This could be related to 'Exception Prevention' or 'Ignore Faulty Behavior', but let's see if any tactic directly matches.

However, note that the warning message itself is part of the text and might indicate a fault handling mechanism (like logging) which isn't in the list. The key point is how InceptionV3 works without producing errors despite mismatches.",None,"The core concept extracted from the text involves an input mismatch not causing an error due to the design of InceptionV3, but this does not directly match any of the provided tactic names. The closest might be 'Exception Prevention' or 'Ignore Faulty Behavior', however, upon closer inspection, these tactics are about preventing errors or ignoring them respectively, while here it's more about a specific component (InceptionV3) being designed to tolerate mismatches without erroring out. There is no explicit tactic in the list that describes this behavior as a deliberate design decision for fault handling."

However, note that `call_variants` does not support output sharding, so the actual speedup might be limited by the postprocessing step.
- Scheduling: The text doesn't describe task allocation or scheduling in detail.
- Brokering: Not mentioned; no matching requests with providers based on energy info.
- Service Adaptation: No dynamic switching of resources for better efficiency is described.
- Increase Efficiency: This tactic involves improving time/memory performance to enhance energy efficiency. The text mentions that the rearchitecture and use of TensorFlow improved performance, and there's a note about using 4-8 CPUs with one GPU being efficient. However, it doesn't explicitly state an improvement in algorithmic efficiency for critical algorithms.
- Reduce Overhead: This involves co-location or removing intermediaries to reduce overhead. The text mentions that `postprocess_variants` needs all outputs and is single-threaded, requiring significant memory, which might be seen as high overhead. But the rearchitecture aims to reduce this overhead by being built on TensorFlow (which can manage resources efficiently) and having a more efficient configuration for variant calling.",Increase Efficiency,"The core concept analysis indicates that DeepVariant was rearchitected with open source in mind, built on TensorFlow, and increased variant calling. The tactic 'Increase Efficiency' best fits because the primary intent is to improve performance (speedup) by using a more optimized architecture (rearchitected) and leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities for better resource utilization and efficiency."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","After initially encountering a failure, successive Next() calls will continue to return the same error--we cannot advance further.","The text describes a behavior where once a failure is encountered, subsequent operations consistently return that error and prevent further progress.",True,"This concept involves handling or reacting to an error condition in a system, which directly relates to fault tolerance and influencing the quality attribute of recoverability or robustness.","The core concept is about maintaining consistency with errors after initial failure. Comparing this to available tactics: Condition Monitoring (checks conditions to prevent faults) doesn't fit as it's proactive; Exception Handling (handles detected exceptions) might be relevant but the text describes a persistent error state rather than handling mechanism; Rollback could involve reverting, but here no reversion is mentioned; Retry assumes transient fault and may succeed on retry, not matching this description of consistent failure.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

However, `Bound Execution Times` is about limiting time for processing events or tasks, which doesn't perfectly match NLP task performance here. Let's reconsider: The core concept involves a trade-off in recall and precision by using an extended set of patterns. This isn't explicitly bounding execution times but rather adjusting the detection rules to influence quality attributes. None of the tactics directly address this specific NLP context except perhaps `Increase Resource Efficiency` or others, but they don't fit well.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

",We have made a number of improvements to the methodology as well.

The change is not just fixing a bug or updating documentation but represents a fundamental shift in how data is structured, which can impact performance.","Now evaluating each tactic against the core concept: 'Increase Semantic Coherence' - This involves moving responsibilities to different modules for better side-effect reduction, but our text doesn't mention changing module structures. The change described (multi-channel tensor) seems more about data representation than responsibility shifting. However, note that the tactic definitions are provided and we must use them as given.

Looking at available tactics: 
- Split Module: Not mentioned in the text.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: Text doesn't indicate moving responsibilities between modules.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface change mentioned.
- Use an Intermediary: No intermediary introduced.
- Restrict Dependencies: No dependency restrictions discussed.
- Refactor: The text mentions improvements but not specifically factoring out common services. It talks about changing the data representation, which might be a form of refactoring but let's see if there's a better fit.
- Abstract Common Services: This is about abstracting similar services to reduce modification costs, but our change doesn't seem to involve creating an abstract service for variant calling steps.

Defer Binding tactics:
- Component Replacement: Not applicable as no binding through replacement.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No compile-time binding mentioned.
- Aspects: Aspect-based techniques not indicated here.
- Configuration-time Binding: No configuration changes described.
- Resource Files: No resource files used for binding.
- Runtime Registration: The change is about data representation, which might be a runtime decision but the tactic definitions are about binding values (like parameters or services) at different times. Our core concept doesn't match this directly.
- Dynamic Lookup: Not relevant as no dynamic service lookup.
- Interpret Parameters: No parameter interpretation for binding.
- Startup Time Binding: The change is not about binding during startup, but a design decision in the methodology.
- Name Servers: Not applicable.
- Plug-ins: No plug-in mechanism introduced.
- Publish-Subscribe: This involves messaging patterns and isn't relevant to data representation changes.
- Shared Repositories: Not mentioned; it's about how data is stored or accessed, but our change is internal to the variant calling process.
- Polymorphism: The text doesn't mention using polymorphism for binding values at runtime. It talks about a multi-channel tensor which might be implemented with different types (polymorphic) but that seems secondary.",Abstract Common Services,"The core concept involves changing the data representation to encode more information in a structured way, which can be seen as abstracting or generalizing the way read data is handled.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

After browsing around a bit, I discovered that this issue was solved for some through installing the .whl separately. So, I download the whl from the [GCloud bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant/packages/tensorflow/) and executed `sudo python2.7 pip install <name of .whl file>` through the terminal. It ran, just to tell me “.dist-info directory not found”. I think this might be due to some inconsistency in the packages installed through the build-prereq.sh script, because I can see that all the packages that it installed (e.g. numpy) are for Python 3.5, but the Tensorflow version it's trying to get is for cp27 (Python 2.7). Not sure about where to go from here, would love some assistance :). System details. OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Python interpreters: Default with Ubuntu (2.7 and 3.5.2). Deep Variant version: Installed it today from the main repo, so probably r0.4.1. Thank you""

","""The biggest change was to move away from RGB-encoded (3-channel) pileup images and instead represent the aligned read data using a multi-channel tensor data layout.""",This describes changing the representation of data in the system by moving from an RGB-based format to a multi-channel tensor layout.,True,"The core concept involves altering how data is represented, which can influence quality attributes like performance (by enabling more efficient processing) and accuracy (by better encoding relevant information).","Evaluating the tactics against the core concept of changing data representation to multi-channel tensor layout:

- Ping/Echo: Not directly related as it's about reachability.
- Monitor: This is a general fault detection, not specific to data representation change.
- Heartbeat: Periodic message exchange for fault detection, doesn't match.
- Timestamp: Event sequencing, unrelated.
- Sanity Checking: General validity check, might be tangentially related but the core concept isn't about checking operations.
- Condition Monitoring: Prevents faulty behavior by monitoring conditions; here we're changing representation which is a different approach.
- Voting: Detects inconsistencies via multiple components with same input/output; not applicable.
- Exception Detection: Detecting system conditions, but this change is more about data modeling than fault detection.
- Self-Test: Components testing themselves, unrelated to the described activity.

Recovery tactics:
- Active Redundancy: Not relevant as no redundancy or parallel processing mentioned.
- Passive Redundancy: No active/passive setup in the text.
- Spare: Cold sparing not indicated.
- Exception Handling: The change is about data representation, not handling exceptions directly.
- Rollback: Reverting to previous state; this is a forward progress with new model.
- Software Upgrade: This tactic involves upgrading code. In our analysis, we see that the methodology was improved and moved to multi-channel tensor layout, which implies an upgrade or change in the system's processing method. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention updating the software itself but rather changing how data is represented and trained on more samples.
- Retry: Transient fault assumption; not relevant here as it's a model improvement.
- Ignore Faulty Behavior: Not applicable.
- Degradation: Dropping less critical functions; this change enhances capabilities, so false.
- Reconfiguration: Recovers from failures by reassigning responsibilities. The core concept is about changing the data representation and training methodology to improve performance and accuracy, which aligns with a broader system reconfiguration rather than just recovering from faults.

Prevention tactics:
- Removal from Service: Not mentioned in the text.
- Transactions: Ensures atomicity etc., not relevant here as it's about model architecture change.
- Predictive Model: This is related to using models for prediction, but our core concept isn't explicitly about predictive modeling. The tactic involves proactive fault avoidance via monitoring and prediction, while the described activity is a reactive improvement based on testing results.
- Exception Prevention: Techniques to prevent exceptions; this text describes changes that improve accuracy which can indirectly help in preventing errors, but it's not directly stated as prevention tactics.
- Increase Competence Set: This tactic expands what states a program can handle. The core concept of using multi-channel tensor layout and training on more samples allows the model to better generalize (handle more cases) and thus increase its competence set for different data types. However, this is about improving generalization through training, not necessarily expanding operational states.

Other tactics:
- Non-Stop Forwarding: Splits control/data planes; unrelated.",None,"The core concept involves changing the data representation to a multi-channel tensor layout and using more diverse training samples. This does not directly match any of the provided tactic names, as it is primarily about improving model performance through architectural changes (like inception-v3) and better data encoding for machine learning purposes.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

","In order to avoid loading spacy models repeatedly, we'll save references to them, keyed by the options we used to create the spacy model, so any particular configuration only gets loaded once.",The primary architectural concept is caching or memoization of resources (spacy models) based on their configuration to avoid redundant loading and improve efficiency.,True,"This describes a deliberate design decision intended to influence performance by reducing the overhead associated with repeatedly loading spacy models, thereby improving resource utilization and potentially decreasing latency.","Evaluating each tactic against the core concept of caching resources:
- Manage Sampling Rate: Not relevant as it deals with data capture frequency.
- Limit Event Response: Not directly related to caching; focuses on event processing rate.
- Prioritize Events: Focuses on event importance, not resource caching.
- Reduce Overhead: This is a broad tactic that could include the described activity. The text specifically mentions saving references to avoid repeated loading, which reduces overhead by eliminating intermediaries or redundant operations.
- Bound Execution Times: Not directly about caching; focuses on time limits for processing.
- Increase Resource Efficiency: This might be relevant as it aims to improve algorithms and decrease latency, but the specific activity described is more about resource sharing (caching) than algorithm improvement. However, by reducing loading overhead, it does increase efficiency.
- Increase Resources: Not applicable; this tactic adds resources rather than managing existing ones through caching.
- Introduce Concurrency: Focuses on parallel processing, not directly on caching.
- Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations: This involves having multiple replicas for computation, which is different from the described single cache mechanism. The text does not mention multiple copies but a shared reference keyed by configuration.
- Maintain Multiple Copies of Data: Similar to above, this tactic keeps multiple data copies for access reasons, whereas the text describes saving references (likely in memory) to avoid loading, so it's more about caching than replication.
- Bound Queue Sizes: Deals with queue management, not resource caching.
- Schedule Resources: Focuses on scheduling strategies, unrelated to caching.",Reduce Overhead,"The core concept of the text is to cache spacy model references based on configuration keys to avoid repeated loading. This directly reduces overhead by minimizing the number of expensive operations (loading models) and aligns with the tactic 'Reduce Overhead' which states: 'Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.'

- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.

- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

9,availability,"dow. windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in the zlib header of the compressed stream. windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits determines the window size. inflate() will then process raw deflate data, not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format such as zip. Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats. For most applications, the zlib format should be used as is. Note that comments above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits. windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding. Add 32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will return a Z_DATA_ERROR). If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32. inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure. msg is set to null if there is no error message. inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression will be done by inflate(). (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is deferred until inflate() is called.","

- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

""dow. windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in the zlib header of the compressed stream. windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits determines the window size. inflate() will then process raw deflate data, not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format such as zip. Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats. For most applications, the zlib format should be used as is. Note that comments above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits. windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding. Add 32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will return a Z_DATA_ERROR). If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32. inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure. msg is set to null if there is no error message. inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression will be done by inflate(). (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is deferred until inflate() is called.""

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

1. **Split Module**: The text does not mention splitting modules into smaller ones; it focuses on runtime improvements without indicating modular decomposition.
2. **Increase Semantic Coherence**: While there might be some refactoring for better structure, the primary goal here is performance optimization (speeding up execution), not necessarily increasing semantic coherence or reducing side effects.
3. **Encapsulate**: The text does not describe introducing an explicit interface to reduce propagation of changes; it's about runtime speedups and optimizations.
4.  **Use an Intermediary** : No mention of breaking dependencies with intermediaries like proxies or adapters.
5. **Restrict Dependencies**: There is a change in how components are run (on Cloud TPUs), but this doesn't explicitly restrict dependencies; it might involve new ones for TPU support.
6. **Refactor**: The text mentions optimizations and changes, which could include refactoring, but the primary intent seems to be performance-related rather than general code improvement or reducing duplication.
7. **Abstract Common Services** : No indication of implementing services in an abstract form; it's about specific runtime bindings for TensorFlow components.
8. **Component Replacement**: Updating TensorFlow version and using Cloud TPUs could involve replacing components, but the description is more about configuration changes than explicit replacement.
9. **Compile-time Parameterization**: The text does not describe binding values at compile time through parameterization; all mentioned optimizations are runtime-related or deployment-related.
10. **Aspects** : No mention of using aspects for cross-cutting concerns or compile-time binding.
11. **Configuration-time Binding**: There might be some configuration involved (like the flag), but it's not explicitly stated as a deliberate design decision at configuration time; the focus is on runtime improvements.
12. **Resource Files** : No mention of using resource files for binding values during startup or initialization.
13. **Runtime Registration** : The changes are about optimizing existing code, not necessarily registering new services dynamically.
14. **Dynamic Lookup**: Not mentioned; the optimizations seem to be static adjustments rather than runtime discovery mechanisms.
15. **Interpret Parameters**: There is a flag that controls the window selector model (`-ws_use_window_selector_model`), which might involve interpreting parameters at runtime, but this seems more like configuration than parameter interpretation for binding values.
16. **Startup Time Binding** : The text mentions optimizations during startup (like `make_examples` running faster due to initialization changes), so there is some relevance here.
17. **Name Servers**: Not mentioned; no indication of using name servers for runtime binding.
18. **Plug-ins**: No mention of adding plug-in capabilities or using them for runtime binding.
19. **Publish-Subscribe** : Not relevant to the described changes, which are about performance and optimization within DeepVariant's components.
20. **Shared Repositories** : The text does not describe sharing repositories as a way to bind values at runtime.
21. **Polymorphism**: There is no mention of using polymorphism for binding or changing behavior based on type; the changes are about specific implementations and optimizations.",None,"Although there are several tactics listed, none from the provided list ('Split Module', 'Increase Semantic Coherence', etc.) directly matches the core concept of performance improvements through runtime bindings or optimizations.

1. **Metering**: The extracted sentence talks about training data for improving accuracy but doesn't involve collecting real-time energy usage data. So, not relevant.
2. **Static Classification** and **Dynamic Classification**: These are about classifying devices based on characteristics or transient conditions to determine energy consumption. But the text is about training a model for better accuracy in variant calling, not directly about device classification for energy purposes.
3. **Vertical Scaling** and **Horizontal Scaling**: The text mentions using a machine with 16 vCPUs and one GPU accelerator (nvidia-tesla-p100). This could be seen as resource allocation but the focus is on training accuracy, not necessarily scaling up or down for performance or energy reasons.
4. **Scheduling** and **Brokering**: These involve task allocation or matching service requests with providers based on energy information. The text doesn't mention scheduling tasks or brokering services; it's about a specific machine setup for training.
5. **Service Adaptation**: This is about dynamically switching resources to ones that offer better efficiency. In the text, they are using a specific GPU machine but not adapting during runtime based on energy efficiency changes.
6. **Increase Efficiency** and **Reduce Overhead**: The core concept involves improving accuracy (a quality attribute) through training. However, these tactics specifically mention increasing time/memory performance or reducing computational overhead for energy reasons. While the improvement in F1 score might imply better resource utilization, it's not explicitly stated as being done to increase efficiency or reduce overhead.",None,"The core concept is about improving accuracy through custom training using specific resources (GPU). None of the tactics directly match this because they are all focused on energy-related aspects: metering, classification for energy purposes, scaling for resource allocation, scheduling/brokering based on energy, service adaptation for efficiency, and increase/reduce efficiency or overhead. The text does not mention any quality attribute related to energy consumption; it's about accuracy in variant calling.

- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Manage Sampling Rate, Limit Event Response, Prioritize Events, Reduce Overhead, Bound Execution Times, Increase Resource Efficiency, Increase Resources, Introduce Concurrency, Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations, Maintain Multiple Copies of Data, Bound Queue Sizes, Schedule Resources

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

","The text describes a concrete technical change: 'Download to temporary file, then copy to cache dir once finished.' This is an implemented solution for handling potential corruption during downloads.",This concept involves managing resource usage by ensuring data integrity through the use of temporary files and delayed copying.,True,"The core concept addresses a deliberate design decision to influence system quality attributes, specifically focusing on reliability or correctness by preventing corrupt cache entries during interrupted downloads. This is not merely a bug fix but an architectural pattern for handling resource management and data integrity.","Now evaluating the tactics against the core concept of managing resources with emphasis on data integrity:

1. Manage Sampling Rate: Not relevant, as it deals with frequency reduction.
2. Limit Event Response: Focuses on event processing rate, not directly related to this download management.
3. Prioritize Events: About ranking events, no mention here.
4. Reduce Overhead: General idea of reducing resources, but the specific action is about file handling and data integrity.
5. Bound Execution Times: Not mentioned in the text.
6. Increase Resource Efficiency: The text doesn't describe improving algorithms for efficiency; it's more about a procedural change to handle interruptions.
7. Control Resource Demand (Manage Sampling Rate): No, as explained above.
8. Limit Event Response: Already considered.
9. Prioritize Events: Not relevant.
10. Reduce Overhead: The text doesn't indicate reducing overhead through intermediaries; it's about a specific sequence to avoid corruption.

Now evaluating Manage Resources tactics:

7. Increase Resources: No, the text does not suggest adding more resources.
8. Introduce Concurrency: Not mentioned, no parallel processing involved.
9. Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations: The text doesn't involve multiple replicas for computation.
10. Maintain Multiple Copies of Data: This tactic involves keeping copies to reduce contention, but the described action is about using a temporary file and then copying once finished – this is more about atomicity or safe state transition rather than maintaining multiple copies.
11. Bound Queue Sizes: Not relevant, no queues mentioned.
12. Schedule Resources: No scheduling discussed.",Bound Execution Times,"The core concept involves ensuring that the download process completes fully before copying to cache, which implicitly bounds the execution time of the critical section (the copy operation) by requiring completion of the download first. However, this is not explicitly about bounding execution times but rather a method to ensure atomicity and prevent partial states."

- Split Module: The text does not describe splitting modules or separating responsibilities.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: This involves moving representations to improve purpose alignment. However, it's more about data structure change than responsibility assignment.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction mentioned.
- Use an Intermediary: Not using any intermediary for the representation change.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text doesn't mention restricting dependencies between modules.
- Refactor: This could be a candidate as it involves restructuring data representation, but refactor is typically about removing duplication and improving structure. However, in this context, it's more specific to machine learning model improvements rather than general refactoring.
- Abstract Common Services: The change is not about abstracting services but changing the data encoding method.

",The text describes a potential change: 'might be cool to adapt to the GC' and also mentions that currently it depends on gc content with a fixed default.,The core concept is about adapting the dependency or parameter of the low complexity filter based on the gc content (Genome Composition) dynamically rather than having a fixed value.,True,"The concept involves changing how values are bound in order to better handle different contexts, which influences quality attributes like flexibility and correctness by allowing adaptation at runtime or configuration time.","Now evaluating the core concept against each tactic:

1. Split Module: This is about dividing a module into smaller ones. The text doesn't mention splitting modules, so it's not relevant.
2. Increase Semantic Coherence: This involves moving responsibilities to different modules for better focus. The text talks about adapting an existing dependency, which isn't directly about coherence or refactoring for side effects reduction.
3. Encapsulate: This is about introducing interfaces to reduce propagation of changes. The text doesn't mention encapsulation or explicit interfaces.
4. Use an Intermediary: Not mentioned in the text; it's about breaking dependencies with intermediaries.
5. Restrict Dependencies: This involves limiting which modules interact. The text suggests adapting a dependency, not restricting it.
6. Refactor: Factoring out common services to reduce duplication. While there might be some refactoring involved if we change how parameters are handled, the core concept is about binding values dynamically based on gc content, not necessarily factoring out services.
7. Abstract Common Services: This involves creating abstract forms for similar services. The text doesn't mention abstraction or multiple modules with common responsibilities.

Defer Binding tactics:
8. Component Replacement: Binding at compile time via replacement scripts. Not relevant here as the change is about runtime adaptation, not compile-time binding through replacements.
9. Compile-time Parameterization: Binding values at compile time by parameterizing code. The text suggests a dynamic or conditional approach based on gc content, which isn't fixed during compilation.
10. Aspects: A way to modularize concerns and apply them cross-cutting. Not directly related; the change is about adjusting parameters, not applying aspects.
11. Configuration-time Binding: Binding at deployment time through configuration files or settings. The text mentions adapting based on gc content, which could be done via configuration if we set it dynamically during setup, but it's more likely to be runtime-based as gc content might vary per instance.
12. Resource Files: Using external resource files for binding values. Not mentioned; the change is about logic in code or parameters.
13. Runtime Registration: Binding values at runtime by registering them. The text doesn't specify registration, but it implies a dynamic adjustment based on gc content.
14. Dynamic Lookup: Similar to runtime registration, looking up services dynamically. Again, not explicitly mentioned.
15. Interpret Parameters: This tactic involves binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters. The core concept of adapting the filter's parameter (the 30% threshold) based on gc content fits well with this. It suggests that instead of a fixed value, we interpret or adjust it dynamically according to input.",Interpret Parameters,"The selected tactic is 'Interpret Parameters' because the core concept involves adjusting the parameter (the 30% threshold) at runtime based on the gc content. This directly matches the idea of binding values by interpreting parameters, which allows for dynamic adaptation rather than a fixed value."

The core concept is about adding regularization to layers during model fine-tuning. This does not directly match any of the tactics listed for reducing size or increasing cohesion. However, looking at Defer Binding tactics: Configuration-time Binding involves binding values at deployment time; Runtime Registration and others involve runtime binding. The text describes updating a model's configuration and reloading it with regularizers to influence future changes (robustness). This aligns most closely with 'Runtime Registration' as the function registers new losses, or possibly 'Component Replacement' if we consider replacing the layer behavior.",Runtime Registration,"The core concept involves updating a model's configuration and reloading it so that newly created losses are registered. This matches the Defer Binding tactic of Runtime Registration, which binds values at runtime through registration."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.

- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.

- Metering: Not mentioned, no resource monitoring or classification.

- Dynamic Classification: No dynamic models for energy consumption.
- Vertical Scaling: The text mentions scaling by updating TensorFlow and using Cloud TPUs, which could be seen as vertical scaling (changing the capacity of existing hardware).

Also, running on Cloud TPUs might imply horizontal scaling if multiple TPU units are involved, but here it's a single change.
- Horizontal Scaling: The text does mention using additional servers or resources (Cloud TPUs) for scaling up, but the primary focus is on performance and efficiency gains rather than explicitly adding more machines.

- Brokering: No matching service requests with providers based on energy characteristics.
- Service Adaptation: Not mentioned, no dynamic switching of computational resources. However, the change to run on Cloud TPUs could be seen as adapting services (inference and training) to a different hardware platform that might offer better performance/efficiency.

- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

19,energy efficiency,"inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back interface for input and output. This is potentially more efficient than inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer. inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large buffers. inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns. inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer. inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw deflate stream with each call. inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the allocated state. A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write ","

This is potentially more efficient than inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer. inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large buffers. inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns. inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer. inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw deflate stream with each call. inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the allocated state. A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write ""

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.

- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- Split Module: The text does not describe splitting into multiple modules.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: This involves moving responsibilities to reduce side effects; no such action is described here.
- Encapsulate: Introduces an interface to limit changes propagating, but this text doesn't mention interfaces or explicit boundaries.
- Use an Intermediary: Breaks dependencies with intermediaries not mentioned in the text.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text restricts references within a fixed window, which is about limiting data scope rather than module interactions directly.
- Refactor: Involves factoring out common responsibilities; no refactoring or moving code is described here.
- Abstract Common Services: Not applicable as there's no mention of abstracting services.
- Component Replacement: No build-time replacement mentioned.
- Compile-time Parameterization: The binding happens at runtime, not compile time.
- Aspects: Aspect-based binding isn't indicated in the text.
- Configuration-time Binding: This would involve deployment configuration; here it's a design choice within code structure.
- Resource Files: Not using resource files for this purpose.
- Runtime Registration: The array is fixed at 64K, but references are bound by maintaining only last 32K strings. It might be considered as runtime binding due to the window mechanism.
- Dynamic Lookup: No dynamic lookup mentioned; it's a static structure with modulo operation.
- Interpret Parameters: Not interpreting parameters for binding values.
- Startup Time Binding: The array size is fixed, but references are limited by maintaining only last 32K strings. This could be seen as initialization or setup time decision.
- Name Servers: No name servers involved.
- Plug-ins: Not using plug-in mechanisms.
- Publish-Subscribe: Not related to messaging patterns.
- Shared Repositories: The array is private and not shared for binding purposes.
- Polymorphism: This involves runtime type checking; the text describes a fixed-size array with modulo operation, which doesn't suggest polymorphic behavior.",None,"The core concept of limiting an array's size by maintaining references only to recent data does not directly match any tactic from the provided list.

- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
