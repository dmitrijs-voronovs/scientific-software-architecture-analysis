However, note that Tailor Interface specifically mentions adding or removing capabilities such as translation or buffering, while this text is about changing the underlying algorithm's behavior and output format (via a parameter).

The core concept is about adding or removing capabilities from an interface to influence its behavior., This matches the 'Tailor Interface' tactic definition: ""Adds or removes capabilities to an interface, such as translation, buffering, or hiding particular functions from untrusted users."" It also aligns with the 'Orchestrate' tactic which involves coordinating and sequencing services. However, the primary focus here is on modifying the interface's capabilities., The text describes a component that implements a feature using SpaCy Matcher and adjusts parameters for recall and precision. This directly relates to tailoring an interface by changing how it processes data or presents results., There might be orchestration involved in coordinating the hyponym detection, but the explicit action is on the interface of the HyponymDetector class., The core concept was identified as: ""The implementation uses a control mechanism that adds or removes capabilities from an interface to influence its behavior."" This fits 'Tailor Interface' more precisely than other tactics. Other relevant tactic names are not directly mentioned, but based on definitions, only these three were provided for consideration., Let's compare with the available tactics:, - Discover Service: Involves locating a service at runtime through a directory service. Not present in this text; no mention of searching or directories., - Orchestrate: Uses control mechanism to coordinate services. The text mentions coordinating the invocation of particular services, but it is not clear if there are multiple services being coordinated here. It seems more like implementing a single component's functionality rather than orchestrating between services., - Tailor Interface: Adds or removes capabilities from an interface. This matches closely as we see adjustments to parameters affecting recall and precision.",Tailor Interface,"The selected tactic is 'Tailor Interface' because the core concept involves modifying the functionality of a component by adjusting its parameters (e.g., `extended=True`) which changes what it does or how it presents information, directly aligning with adding or removing capabilities from an interface. The other tactics are not as relevant: Discover Service deals with service location at runtime; Orchestrate is about coordinating multiple services."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Increase Semantic Coherence - No mention of moving responsibilities or reducing side effects.
Encapsulate - Not introducing an interface for changes.
Use an Intermediary - No intermediary introduced.
Restrict Dependencies - This is actually adding a dependency (supporting Python 3.12) rather than restricting.
Refactor - The text mentions fixing and updating code, but it's not clear if this constitutes refactoring to reduce duplication in the architectural sense.
Abstract Common Services - Not mentioned.
Component Replacement - Updating scipy might be considered component replacement, but nmslib is replaced with nmslib-metabrainz which could be a form of intermediary or dependency change. However, Component Replacement typically binds values at compile time or build time through replacement, and here it's more about updating libraries for compatibility.

This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

Orchestrate - This tactic coordinates multiple services. The text does not mention coordinating services but rather updating and replacing components for compatibility.

Discover Service involves locating services at runtime; here it's just dependency updates without explicit service discovery changes.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

",* Changed window selector to use a linear decision model for choosing realignment candidates. This can be controlled by a flag `-ws_use_window_selector_model` which is now on by default.,"The change involves modifying the window selector component to utilize a new algorithm (linear decision model) and making it active by default, likely to improve performance or accuracy through optimized runtime behavior.",True,"This concept describes a deliberate design decision intended to influence a quality attribute. Specifically, the change in window selector's implementation is designed to enhance performance (as mentioned earlier) and possibly other attributes like maintainability by introducing a configurable default state.","The core concept involves changing an algorithm within a component for better runtime performance and accuracy. This aligns with tactics that involve modifying or replacing components, particularly those focused on optimizing performance through changes in algorithms or services.

Looking at the available tactics:
- Split Module: Not relevant as there's no mention of splitting modules.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: The change is about algorithmic improvement for performance, not necessarily increasing coherence between responsibilities.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction mentioned.
- Use an Intermediary: No intermediary introduced to break dependencies.
- Restrict Dependencies: Not relevant as the text doesn't discuss restricting interactions.
- Refactor: The change involves replacing a component's algorithm, which could be considered refactoring if it factors out common services or improves structure. However, the tactic 'Refactor' is defined as factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication. In this text, there's no mention of extracting common responsibilities; instead, a specific component (window selector) is being changed.
- Abstract Common Services: This change doesn't abstract services but replaces the algorithm within one service with another for performance reasons.

Defer Binding tactics:
- Component Replacement: The window selector might be replaced by a new implementation, but it's not clear if this constitutes replacement or just an update. However, the tactic definition says 'Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.' This doesn't match as no binding is being changed.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Not relevant; no mention of compile-time changes.
- Aspects: No aspect-based approach mentioned.
- Configuration-time Binding: The change introduces a flag that controls the behavior, which could be seen as configuration-time binding if it's set at deployment time. However, the tactic is about binding values (like parameters or services), and this text describes changing an algorithm in a component, not necessarily binding values.
- Resource Files: Not relevant; no resource files are used for binding.
- Runtime Registration: No runtime registration of components mentioned.
- Dynamic Lookup: This involves looking up services at runtime. The change is about implementing a new model within the window selector itself, which might be considered as changing how it operates (like dynamic behavior) but not necessarily through lookup. However, the tactic definition says 'Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for services.' Here, no service binding via lookup.
- Interpret Parameters: This involves interpreting parameters to bind values. The change uses a flag (`-ws_use_window_selector_model`) which might be interpreted as a parameter, but it's not clear if this is the primary method of influencing the behavior or just one aspect. Also, the tactic definition says 'Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.' In this case, the window selector now has an algorithm that can be influenced by a flag (which could be seen as a parameter), so there might be some overlap.
- Startup Time Binding: No binding during startup mentioned; it's about changing the component's behavior.
- Name Servers: Not relevant for service binding via name servers.
- Plug-ins: The change is not through plug-in mechanism but an internal update to the window selector.
- Publish-Subscribe: This pattern isn't used here.
- Shared Repositories: No shared repositories mentioned.
- Polymorphism: The change doesn't involve polymorphic behavior; it's a specific algorithm implementation.",Abstract Common Services,"The core concept involves changing the window selector to use a linear decision model, which is an improvement in its internal logic. This fits with 'Abstract Common Services' because by refining this component (which might be part of a service) and giving it better performance through algorithmic changes, we're effectively abstracting or generalizing the common functionality for that purpose. However, note that the tactic definition says 'Implementing similar services once in a more general (abstract) form.' Here, only one specific window selector is being changed, not multiple similar ones. But given the lack of better fit and the fact that it's an internal optimization, this seems to be the closest match among the available tactics."

Tailor Interface - This involves adding capabilities like buffering or hiding functions by modifying interfaces. In this context, splitting can be seen as tailoring the interface for handling large data by breaking it into chunks (buffering) and controlling access through file naming mechanisms.",Tailor Interface,"The 'Tailor Interface' tactic is selected because the text describes adding capabilities to handle large datasets, specifically by splitting output files in different ways which can be considered as tailoring the interface for efficient data processing. The other tactics don't fit: Discover Service isn't about locating services but managing data partitioning; Orchestrate involves coordinating external services, not applicable here."

5,availability,"inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back interface for input and output. This is potentially more efficient than inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer. inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large buffers. inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns. inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer. inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw deflate stream with each call. inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the allocated state. A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.

## Text To Analyze:
""inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back interface for input and output. This is potentially more efficient than inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer. inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large buffers. inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns. inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer. inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw deflate stream with each call. inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the allocated state. A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write ""

""Pin scispacy to 2.1.x; The current models are not compatible with spacy 2.2. Pinning the scispacy version until we can upgrade to 2.2 and release new models.""
",Pinning the scispacy version until we can upgrade to 2.2 and release new models.,"The text describes a deliberate design decision to restrict the version of a dependency (scispacy) by pinning it, likely to maintain compatibility with existing components while deferring updates.",True,This concept involves making a deliberate choice about how dependencies are handled in order to influence system quality attributes such as stability or compatibility during changes.,"Evaluating the core concept against available tactics:
- Split Module: Not relevant, no splitting mentioned.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: Not directly addressed; pinning is more about dependency management than restructuring for better coherence.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction or encapsulation discussed.
- Use an Intermediary: The text does not indicate the use of an intermediary to break dependencies.
- Restrict Dependencies: This matches closely as it involves limiting which versions a module can interact with by pinning, thus restricting dependencies explicitly.
- Refactor: No refactoring activities described; this is about version control.
- Abstract Common Services: Not mentioned or implied in the text.
- Component Replacement: The text does not involve replacing components but rather fixing a dependency version.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Pinning happens at setup time, not compile time.
- Aspects: No aspect-based approach described.
- Configuration-time Binding: This could be related if pinning is done via configuration files, but the text specifies it as a command (pin scispacy) which might be closer to build or deployment scripts rather than explicit configuration. However, in many systems, pinning versions can be considered a form of binding at setup time.
- Resource Files: Not using resource files for version control.
- Runtime Registration: Version pinning is done before runtime, not dynamically during execution.
- Dynamic Lookup: Opposite; this is static pinning.
- Interpret Parameters: No interpretation involved in the text.
- Startup Time Binding: Pinning occurs at setup time, which might be considered a form of binding but typically startup time refers to dynamic loading or configuration. Here it's fixed version dependency.
- Name Servers: Not relevant; no network services mentioned.
- Plug-ins: Not related to plugins for functionality extension.
- Publish-Subscribe: No messaging pattern involved.
- Shared Repositories: The text is about pinning a library, not sharing data structures or repositories.
- Polymorphism: Version pinning does not relate to runtime polymorphic behavior.",Restrict Dependencies,"The core concept of deliberately restricting the scispange version by pinning it aligns with 'Restrict Dependencies' from the available tactics. This tactic is intended to influence quality attributes such as stability and compatibility, which matches the text's focus on preventing incompatibilities until new models are released."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- Split Module: Not relevant, no module splitting mentioned.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No mention of moving responsibilities for coherence.
- Encapsulate: The issue is about installation location affecting dependencies, not introducing an interface to reduce coupling.
- Use an Intermediary: Not applicable, the text doesn't describe breaking a dependency with an intermediary.
- Restrict Dependencies: This tactic involves controlling which modules interact. Here, the problem is about where packages are installed and copied, so it's more about adjusting installation behavior than restricting dependencies.
- Refactor: The change isn't about factoring out common services but rather fixing an existing issue related to package locations.
- Abstract Common Services: Not relevant, no abstraction or reuse of services mentioned.
- Component Replacement: This involves replacing a component. Here, the user is not replacing anything but adjusting installation and possibly requesting a fix.
- Compile-time Parameterization: The issue occurs at runtime (version 0.7.2) due to changed install location, so it's not about compile-time binding.
- Aspects: Not mentioned or relevant here.
- Configuration-time Binding: This tactic involves binding values during deployment configuration.

- The activity described is a configuration change in a system component.
- This aligns with tactics that involve binding values at different times or through different mechanisms.

Available relevant tactics from the list include: Configuration-time Binding, Runtime Registration, etc., but note that the tactic definitions provided are for 'Defer Binding' category.",None,"The core concept is about changing a configuration parameter (model name) to use different BERT models. However, this does not match any of the defined tactics directly because:
- The tactics listed under Defer Binding are about binding values at compile time or runtime for things like model names, but they require specific conditions.

Looking at the available tactic definitions:
- Configuration-time Binding: This is part of 'Defer Binding' and involves binding at deployment time. However, in this text there's no mention of changing configuration files during deployment.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Involves parameterizing code at compile time, but here it's a runtime change (or potential).

The closest defined tactic might be 'Component Replacement', which is under Defer Binding and involves binding values by replacing components. However, the definition of Component Replacement says: ""Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles."" This does not match because:
- The change described (replacing model name) appears to be done via configuration files or parameters during setup, which is more like runtime binding.

Another candidate is 'Resource Files' but that's about using resource files for binding at startup. Not directly applicable here.

Given the lack of a direct match and the fact that this change might simply be replacing one component with another without any explicit architectural decision to defer or abstract binding, it does not fit into any of the provided tactic names."

- Split Module: Not relevant, as no splitting or modularization is described.

- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction mentioned.
- Use an Intermediary: Not indicated, no intermediary introduced for dependency breaking.
- Restrict Dependencies: The change is about data representation, not restricting dependencies.
- Refactor: The text describes a rearchitecture and improvement in methodology, which involves changing how data is represented. This could be considered refactoring as it factors out the old RGB approach and replaces it with a tensor-based one for better accuracy.
- Abstract Common Services: Not relevant, no common services being abstracted or factored out.
- Component Replacement: The change might involve replacing the way data is handled, but not necessarily through component replacement in build scripts.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No compile-time binding mentioned; it's about changing the representation itself.
- Aspects: Not indicated as an aspect-based approach.
- Configuration-time Binding: This tactic involves binding values at deployment time, while the change is a fundamental rearchitecture of data handling, not value binding.
- Resource Files: The change doesn't use resource files for binding; it's about data structure modification.
- Runtime Registration/Dynamic Lookup/Startup Time Binding: These are about runtime binding, but this change seems to be done at design time or during development (rearchitected with open source release in mind). It's not clear if the multi-channel tensor is bound dynamically.
- Interpret Parameters: Not relevant; no parameters being interpreted for value binding.
- Name Servers/Plug-ins/Publish-Subscribe: These are about runtime binding mechanisms, but this change is a data representation shift, not using these patterns.
- Shared Repositories: This tactic involves shared repositories at runtime, while the core concept is about changing how data is stored and processed internally.",Refactor,"The selected tactic is Refactor because it describes moving away from an old method (RGB-encoded pileup images) to a new one (multi-channel tensor data layout). This change factors out the previous representation by introducing a more general and efficient way of encoding aligned read data, which aligns with the definition of Refactor: 'Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.'

A payload consists of a [key,value] pair, where the key is a string referring to a unique type URL and the value is an object of type `absl::Cord` to hold the contextual data. The type URL should be unique and follow the format of a URL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) and, ideally, provide some documentation or schema on how to interpret its associated data. For example, the default type URL for a protobuf message type is type.googleapis.com/packagename.messagename"". Other custom wire formats should define the format of type URL in a similar practice so as to minimize the chance of conflict between type URLs. Users should ensure that the type URL can be mapped to a concrete C++ type if they want to deserialize the payload and read it effectively. To attach a payload to a status object, call `Status::SetPayload()`, passing it the type URL and an `absl::Cord` of associated data. Similarly, to extract the payload from a status, call `Status::GetPayload()`. You may attach multiple payloads (with differing type URLs) to any given status object, provided that the status is currently exhibiting an error code (i.e. is not OK). TODO: Use absl::Cord for payload value type. The Payload-related APIs are cloned from absl::Status. Returns the payload of a status given its unique `type_url` key, if present.""
","A payload may be attached to a status object to provide additional context to an error that may not be satisfied by an existing `tsl::error::Code`.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""Clears the error and end-of-file flags for file. This is analogous to the clearerr() function in stdio. This is useful for continuing to read a gzip file that is being written concurrently.""
",Cleared the error and end-of-file flags for file.,"This describes an operation to reset or clear specific state indicators (error and EOF flags) in order to allow continued reading of data, likely as part of handling concurrent writes or ensuring proper stream management.",True,"The concept involves a deliberate design decision intended to influence the quality attribute by managing system state to prevent errors during concurrent operations. Clearing flags is an action taken to reset conditions and allow continued processing, which can be seen as part of fault prevention or handling.","Based on core_concept_analysis: 'Cleared the error and end-of-file flags for file.' This concept relates to managing state in a system component. It involves resetting indicators that might otherwise cause incorrect behavior during concurrent data processing.

Available tactics considered:
- Detect Faults: The action of clearing flags is not primarily about detecting faults but rather preventing issues by ensuring the correct state before proceeding with operations.
- Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: Clearing flags can be a preparatory step to reset conditions, which aligns somewhat with recovery mechanisms. However, it's more focused on prevention or handling than full fault recovery.
- Prevent Faults: This tactic directly involves preventing faults by clearing indicators that might lead to errors in concurrent scenarios.",Increase Competence Set,"The core concept is about managing state (clearing error and EOF flags) to allow continued reading of a gzip file being written concurrently. While it resembles fault prevention, the action itself doesn't expand the competence set but rather ensures that existing operations can proceed without errors by resetting conditions. However, among the available tactics, 'Increase Competence Set' is about expanding operational states, which might not be the best fit here. The text describes a specific operation to clear flags for file handling, which could be part of fault prevention or condition monitoring but doesn't directly match any tactic in the list except perhaps 'Exception Prevention'. But since 'Exception Prevention' isn't listed and we must choose from the provided names, let's reevaluate.

Looking at the core concept: clearing state indicators to allow continued operation. This is more about ensuring that a component can handle its normal operations without being tripped by errors or EOF conditions. It doesn't involve multiple components voting, preparing for fail-over with spares, or preventing exceptions from occurring in general but specifically resetting flags.

The closest tactic might be 'Exception Prevention' if it were available, but since the list provided does not include that exact name (though similar tactics are listed elsewhere), we must stick to the given names. The text doesn't explicitly describe a deliberate design decision for fault prevention or detection; it's more of an implementation detail or a specific function call.

Given the constraints and the available tactic names, 'Increase Competence Set' does not seem appropriate because the action is about resetting existing conditions rather than expanding what states the system can handle. However, let's consider if there's any other tactic that fits better:
- Condition Monitoring: The clearing of flags might be part of a monitoring strategy to reset and check conditions.
- Exception Handling: Clearing an error flag could be seen as handling an exception by masking it or resetting its effect.

But the text doesn't explicitly mention these. It's simply describing what was done in code. Since we must choose from the provided list, and 'Increase Competence Set' is not a good fit (as it implies expanding competence to handle more states), I think there might be no tactic that perfectly matches this description.

However, upon closer inspection of the core concept: clearing error and EOF flags for file. This can be interpreted as part of fault prevention by ensuring that the system doesn't get stuck in an erroneous state when reading concurrently written data. The 'Exception Prevention' tactic is not listed, but there's a similar one called 'Predictive Model' which isn't relevant here.

Let's look at the available tactics again:
- Prevent Faults: Includes 'Removal from Service', 'Transactions', etc., none of which directly match clearing flags. However, 'Exception Prevention' is not in this list either.
- Detect Faults: Clearing flags doesn't detect faults but rather prevents them or handles their effects by resetting the state.

Given that the text describes a specific action (clearing flags) and it's part of handling concurrent writes to avoid errors, I think 'Exception Prevention' would be the best fit if it were available. But since it is not in the list, we must choose from what's there or set to None.

But wait, let's check the system prompt: The tactic names are provided and we must select one of them OR None. In this case, 'Increase Competence Set' doesn't fit because clearing flags isn't about expanding competence but ensuring existing operations work correctly. Similarly, other tactics like 'Retry', 'Ignore Faulty Behavior', etc., don't directly apply.

Perhaps the text is describing a fault prevention mechanism by resetting conditions to allow continued operation without errors. This could be loosely related to 'Condition Monitoring' or even 'Self-Test', but those are not in the list.

Since none of the tactics seem to perfectly match, and we must choose one from the provided list OR None, I think it's appropriate to set selected_tactic to None because no tactic name directly corresponds to this action. However, let's double-check if any tactic might be a stretch:
- Condition Monitoring: The clearing of flags is part of monitoring or resetting conditions.
- Exception Handling: Clearing an error flag could be masking the fault by removing its effect."

","In order to avoid loading spacy models repeatedly, we'll save references to them, keyed by the options we used to create the spacy model, so any particular configuration only gets loaded once.","The primary architectural concept is caching data or objects (in this case, spacy models) based on their configuration keys to avoid redundant loading and improve efficiency.",True,This describes a deliberate design decision intended to influence performance by reducing the overhead of repeatedly loading the same model. It directly addresses resource usage and execution time optimization.,"Now, evaluating each tactic against the core concept:
- Manage Sampling Rate: This is about capturing data less frequently, not relevant.
- Limit Event Response: About processing events at a limited rate, not matching.
- Prioritize Events: Not related to event prioritization.
- Reduce Overhead: The text describes reducing overhead by avoiding repeated loading of models. This tactic involves removing intermediaries or unnecessary steps in the process.
- Bound Execution Times: While improving efficiency might help with execution times, the core concept is about caching and not directly bounding time.
- Increase Resource Efficiency: This could be related as it improves algorithms to decrease latency, but the text specifically talks about saving references (caching) rather than algorithm improvement. However, caching can improve resource efficiency by reducing load on resources.
- Increase Resources: Not relevant, no increase in hardware or resources mentioned.
- Introduce Concurrency: No parallel processing discussed.
- Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations: This tactic involves having multiple replicas for computation to reduce contention. The text does not mention maintaining multiple copies; it's about caching a single reference based on keys.
- Maintain Multiple Copies of Data: Caching models can be seen as maintaining multiple copies, but the key is that they are keyed by configuration options, so it's more like one copy per unique key rather than multiple independent copies. However, this tactic typically refers to data replication for access speed or fault tolerance.
- Bound Queue Sizes: Not related to queues.
- Schedule Resources: No scheduling mentioned.",Reduce Overhead,"The core concept is caching models based on configuration keys to avoid repeated loading. This reduces the overhead by eliminating redundant operations, aligning with the 'Reduce Overhead' tactic which aims to decrease resource consumption in processing an event stream or similar tasks."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32. inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure. msg is set to null if there is no error message. inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression will be done by inflate(). (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is deferred until inflate() is called.""
","The text describes a change in the way windowBits parameter is used: it can be zero, negative values for raw inflate, or greater than 15 with additional flags. It also mentions that inflateInit2 does not process header information and defers this to inflate(), which handles actual decompression.","The text describes a design decision to defer the processing of compressed data headers until runtime by using the inflate() function for decompression, rather than having inflateInit2 handle them.",True,This concept involves deferring certain operations (header decoding) to runtime through specific functions and parameters. It is a deliberate design decision intended to influence quality attributes such as flexibility or maintainability by allowing different compressed formats without changing the core decompression logic.,"Evaluating against available tactics:
- Split Module: Not mentioned, no splitting of modules.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: The text discusses parameters and behavior but doesn't explicitly move responsibilities to reduce side effects.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction discussed.
- Use an Intermediary: Not applicable; the change is in parameter handling without introducing a new intermediary.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text mentions that inflateInit2 does not perform decompression, but it doesn't explicitly restrict dependencies. It's more about deferring functionality.
- Refactor: No mention of factoring out common responsibilities or assigning them an appropriate home.
- Abstract Common Services: Not mentioned; no abstracting similar services once in a general form.
- Component Replacement: The change is not through replacement but by parameterization and function behavior.",Defer binding,"The core concept involves deferring the processing of header information until runtime. This aligns with tactics that defer binding, such as using functions or parameters to bind values at different times (compile-time, configuration-time, etc.). The text specifically states that inflateInit2 does not process headers and defers this to inflate(), which is a form of runtime binding for the decompression behavior based on the windowBits parameter. This fits under 'Defer Binding' as it allows flexibility in handling compressed data formats without changing the core logic."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

2,energy efficiency,"s. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:. ```. >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1. AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA. >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2. AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT. >polyA.

""s. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:. ```. >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1. AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA. >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2. AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT. >polyA.

","The text describes how to specify adapter sequences for PE data in the `fastp` tool, including options like `-a`, `--adapter_sequence`, and `--detect_adapter_for_pe`. It also mentions built-in adapters and a FASTA file option.",Specifying or detecting adapter sequences dynamically based on input type (PE) to trim adapters from sequencing reads.,True,"The concept involves dynamic decision-making for resource adaptation, specifically trimming computational overhead in data processing by using adapter information.","Evaluating the core concept against available tactics:
- The core concept is about specifying or detecting adapters to trim them from PE data.
- This aligns with 'Service Adaptation' (dynamically switching resources for better efficiency) and 'Reduce Overhead' (removing intermediaries). However, it's more specific to trimming adapters in sequencing tools rather than general resource adaptation.",Reduce Overhead,"The core concept involves specifying or detecting adapter sequences to trim them from PE data. This directly relates to reducing computational overhead and energy demands by removing unnecessary intermediaries (adapters) that might be present in the data, thus aligning with 'Reduce Overhead'. While it could loosely relate to 'Service Adaptation', the primary focus here is on trimming adapters for efficiency, which fits better with 'Reduce Overhead' from the Resource Adaptation category."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.
