","The text describes installation methods for a package called nmslib or scispaCy, including various pip and conda commands, instructions on setting up virtual environments using Mamba, and details about loading models.","The goal is to provide multiple ways to install the software, ensuring compatibility with different systems and configurations while minimizing potential errors during setup.","Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing code size. No Match.
Increase Semantic Coherence: There's no discussion about moving unrelated responsibilities to separate modules for better side-effect prevention. No Match.
Encapsulate: While setting up a virtual environment might act as an encapsulation mechanism, the tactic definition specifically refers to introducing interfaces to reduce change propagation, which isn't directly addressed here. The text focuses on installation rather than internal structure changes. No Match.
Use an Intermediary: Not applicable; no mention of breaking dependencies with intermediaries like adapters or proxies in this context. No Match.
Restrict Dependencies: Installation instructions don't explicitly restrict module interactions but set up isolated environments which can indirectly help by containing the dependency scope. However, it's not a direct application as per tactic definition. No Match.
Refactor: The text doesn't involve factoring out common responsibilities from modules or assigning them elsewhere for duplication reduction. It's about installation commands and procedures. No Match.
Abstract Common Services: Not mentioned; no indication of creating abstract services to reduce modification costs in the context of installation. No Match.
Component Replacement: This tactic involves binding values at compile time via replacement, but the text describes runtime installations or configurations (e.g., pip install with flags). The methods are for deployment/initialization, not static build-time replacements. No Match.
Compile-time Parameterization: Installation is done at runtime or initialization, not compile time. Tactic requires parameter binding during compilation. No Match.
Aspects: Aspect-oriented programming isn't discussed in the text; it's about installation and environment setup. No Match.
Configuration-time Binding: The text mentions setting up virtual environments (like Mamba) which might be considered configuration at deployment, but the tactics listed under defer binding are more specific to value binding during compile or runtime steps not directly tied to software architecture internals. However, using resource files or other config methods for installation isn't covered by this tactic's definition in the context provided. No Match.
Resource Files: Not mentioned; no use of external configuration files for installation purposes described here. No Match.
Runtime Registration: Installation commands are executed at runtime but they don't register services dynamically within the system architecture, just set up dependencies externally. The text is about installing a library, not internal service binding. No Match.
Dynamic Lookup: This involves runtime lookup of services, which isn't part of the installation process described; it's more about how to use the installed software. No Match.
Interpret Parameters: While some pip commands include flags (like CFLAGS), these are compile-time or build-time settings for compilation options, not runtime interpretation in an architectural sense. The tactic is defined as binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters, but here it's more about configuration during setup. No Match.
Startup Time Binding: Installation might occur at startup time if done via scripts that run on launch, but the text doesn't specify such a mechanism for the software architecture itself; it's about installing dependencies before running the code. The tactic is about binding values during startup, which could be relevant if we consider environment setup as part of the application start, but in this context, it's separate from core architectural changes. No Match.
Name Servers: Not related to installation or dependency management mentioned here; no use of name servers for service discovery. No Match.
Plug-ins: The text doesn't discuss runtime loading of plug-in modules via an API as a way to extend functionality dynamically. It focuses on installation, not plugin architecture. No Match.
Publish-Subscribe: This is about decoupling components through messaging patterns, which isn't addressed in the installation context. No Match.
Shared Repositories: Not mentioned; no indication of sharing configuration or state between modules during installation. The text talks about installing a library that might be used by multiple applications but doesn't specify shared repositories for binding values at runtime. No Match.
Abstract Common Services (again?): Wait, the list has 'Abstract Common Services' under defer binding? Let me check: In the available tactics section, it's listed as part of Defer Binding category with definition about abstracting common services to reduce modification costs. But in Increase Cohesion, there is a tactic called Abstract Common Services that factors out responsibilities and assigns them an appropriate home. There seems to be duplication or confusion between categories.

Looking back at the user prompt: The 'Relevant Tactic Names' are provided for each quality attribute separately? No, let's read carefully:

User Prompt says: ""Based on the rules in the system prompt, analyze the following available tactics and text and provide the JSON output.""

Then lists: 
- Split Module (for Reduce Size)
- Increase Semantic Coherence (for Increase Cohesion)
- Then a list for Reduce Coupling with multiple tactics.
- And then Defer Binding with its own set of tactics including some that might overlap, like 'Abstract Common Services' is listed in both Increase Cohesion and Defer Binding categories? That's confusing.

In the available tactics section:

Under ""Reduce Coupling"" -> ""Restrict Dependencies"": ...
Then under ""Defer Binding"" -> ""Abstract Common Services"": ... which says: Implementing similar services once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs. This is actually about abstracting common functionalities, not necessarily binding values at runtime.

But wait, the tactic names are duplicated? Let's see:

In Increase Cohesion tactics: ""Abstract Common Services"" with definition for cohesion.
In Defer Binding tactics: ""Abstract Common Services"" but now it says ""Implementing similar services once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs."" This seems like the same tactic name but different definitions? Or perhaps I misread.

Looking at the user prompt again:

## Relevant Tactic Names for this Quality Attribute
Split Module, Increase Semantic Coherence, Encapsulate, Use an Intermediary, Restrict Dependencies, Refactor, Abstract Common Services, Component Replacement, Compile-time Parameterization, Aspects, Configuration-time Binding, Resource Files, Runtime Registration, Dynamic Lookup, Interpret Parameters, Startup Time Binding, Name Servers, Plug-ins, Publish-Subscribe, Shared Repositories, Polymorphism

Then in the available tactics section:

It's grouped by quality attributes. Under Reduce Coupling: Encapsulate, Use an Intermediary, Restrict Dependencies, Refactor (which is about cohesion), Abstract Common Services.
Under Defer Binding: Component Replacement, Compile-time Parameterization, Aspects, Configuration-time Binding, Resource Files, Runtime Registration, Dynamic Lookup, Interpret Parameters, Startup Time Binding, Name Servers, Plug-ins, Publish-Subscribe, Shared Repositories, Polymorphism

But the tactic 'Abstract Common Services' appears in both lists. This might be an error or intentional? The definition under Increase Cohesion is: ""Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects."" and it's called ""Increase Semantic Coherence"".
Under Defer Binding, for 'Abstract Common Services', it says: ""Implementing similar services once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs."" This is actually closer to what would be under Increase Cohesion or perhaps even Reduce Coupling if we consider abstract interfaces reducing coupling. But the name is different.

In my analysis, I should stick to the provided list of tactic names and their definitions as given in the user prompt for classification.

Continuing with evaluation:

Polymorphism: The text doesn't mention using polymorphic behavior or runtime binding through inheritance/method overriding for value binding. It's about installation methods. No Match.",None,"The provided text describes various installation and configuration procedures, but none of the listed architectural tactics directly apply to these instructions as they pertain to software structure changes rather than deployment or setup mechanisms."

","The text describes a Python context manager that wraps main() code, catching specific exceptions and exiting quietly while propagating others normally.","The goal appears to be handling errors gracefully by preventing certain exceptions from causing stacktraces in user-facing binaries, specifically within the main() function. This suggests an architectural concern with managing error behavior for better user experience or program stability.","Split Module: The text does not mention splitting a module into smaller ones; it describes adding functionality to existing code structure (wrapping). -> No Match
Increase Semantic Coherence: There is no discussion of moving responsibilities between modules based on shared purpose. This tactic focuses on reducing side effects through better organization, which isn't evident here. -> No Match
Encapsulate: The text talks about wrapping exceptions and controlling exit behavior, but it doesn't introduce an explicit interface to reduce coupling by limiting interactions. It's more about error handling than encapsulation. -> No Match
Use an Intermediary: This tactic involves breaking dependencies with intermediaries (like a facade). The described function acts as a wrapper for main() code without introducing a new intermediary module or service; it modifies the existing flow. -> No Match
Restrict Dependencies: Not relevant, as there's no mention of restricting how modules interact with each other based on visibility/authorization rules. This is about exception handling. -> No Match

Component Replacement: This tactic binds values at compile time or build time via replacement. The text describes runtime behavior for exceptions and exit, not binding through replacements. -> No Match
Compile-time Parameterization: Not applicable; the described mechanism uses arguments passed at runtime (allowed_exceptions tuple) rather than compile-time parameters. -> No Match

Configuration-time Binding: The text does not mention binding values at deployment time through configuration files; the mechanism is hardcoded for main() and uses arguments passed to the function. -> No Match
Resource Files: Not relevant, as there's no use of external resource files (like config or data files) to bind behavior. The exceptions are defined via an argument tuple. -> No Match
Runtime Registration: This tactic involves binding at runtime through registration mechanisms. The text describes a static context manager that catches and handles exceptions based on predefined conditions without any dynamic registration process. -> No Match
Dynamic Lookup: Not applicable; the function does not use services or objects found dynamically (e.g., via service locators). It's about catching specific exception types, which is type-based at runtime but doesn't involve lookup for different services. -> No Match
Interpret Parameters: This tactic binds values by interpreting parameters at runtime. The text mentions that `allowed_exceptions` and `exit_value` are passed as arguments (parameters) to the function, so they are bound when the context manager is used. However, this is more about parameterization for configuration than a general architectural goal of binding values. -> No Match
Startup Time Binding: This involves binding during startup. The text does not specify that bindings happen at program start-up; it describes wrapping main() code which executes immediately upon program launch. Startup time might refer to initialization before the main function runs, but here the mechanism is applied within main(). -> No Match
Name Servers: Not relevant for this context manager's functionality, as no name servers are involved in binding values or services. This tactic typically applies to distributed systems with service discovery. -> No Match
Plug-ins: The text does not involve loading code dynamically at runtime through plug-in mechanisms (e.g., plugins loaded by a loader). It's about static exception handling within the main function. -> No Match
Publish-Subscribe: Not applicable; this is for decoupling components via messaging, which isn't related to error handling or wrapping exceptions here. -> No Match
Shared Repositories: This tactic binds values through shared data stores at runtime. The text does not mention any shared repositories being used to bind behavior. It's about direct exception handling in the main function. -> No Match
Polymorphism: This involves binding different implementations based on type or context at runtime, which is a form of Defer Binding. However, the described function doesn't use polymorphic dispatch; it uses simple tuple matching for exceptions and exits. There's no indication of multiple types being bound to a common interface via inheritance or interfaces. -> No Match",None,"The provided text describes an exception handling mechanism within Python main() functions, but none of the available tactics directly match its description as it doesn't involve splitting modules, increasing semantic coherence, reducing coupling through encapsulation or intermediaries, restricting dependencies, refactoring to remove duplication, abstracting common services, or deferring binding in a way that aligns with standard architectural patterns. The closest might be 'Interpret Parameters' due to the use of arguments (allowed_exceptions and exit_value), but this is not a strong match as it doesn't represent a core architectural goal like those listed."

- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""Classes that provide the interface for reading genomics data. `GenomicsReader` defines the core API supported by readers, and is subclassed directly or indirectly (via `DispatchingGenomicsReader`) for all concrete implementations. `TFRecordReader` is an implementation of the `GenomicsReader` API for reading `TFRecord` files. This is usable for all data types when encoding data in protocol buffers. `DispatchingGenomicsReader` is an abstract class defined for convenience on top of `GenomicsReader` that supports reading from either the native file format or from `TFRecord` files of the corresponding protocol buffer used to encode data of that file type. The input format assumed is dependent upon the filename of the input data. Concrete implementations for individual file types (e.g. BED, SAM, VCF, etc.) reside in type-specific modules in this package. The instantiation of readers may have reader-specific requirements documented there. General examples of the `iterate()` and `query()` functionality are shown below. ```python Equivalent ways to iterate through all elements in a reader. 1. Using the reader itself as an iterable object. kwargs = ... Reader-specific keyword arguments. with GenomicsReaderSubClass(output_path, **kwargs) as reader: for proto in reader: do_something(reader.header, proto) 2. Calling the iterate() method of the reader explicitly. with GenomicsReaderSubClass(output_path, **kwargs) as reader: for proto in reader.iterate(): do_something(reader.header, proto) Querying for all elements within a specific region of the genome. from third_party.nucleus.protos import range_pb2 region = range_pb2.Range(reference_name='chr1', start=10, end=20) with GenomicsReaderSubClass(output_path, **kwargs) as reader: for proto in reader.query(region): do_something(reader.header, proto) ```""

- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

Contains the paths to the data required for the entity linker. ef_search: int, optional (default = 200) Controls speed performance at query time. Max value is 2000, but reducing to around ~100 will increase query speed by an order of magnitude for a small performance hit.""

It focuses on configuration parameters for query speed. No Match.
Static Classification: There is no discussion of classifying devices or resources based on characteristics; the tactic involves benchmarking which isn't referenced here. No Match.
Dynamic Classification: Not applicable as there's no transient condition monitoring mentioned, and it requires real-time data collection not present in the text. No Match.
Vertical Scaling: The text talks about adjusting parameters for query performance but does not involve adding or removing resources dynamically to handle varying loads. It is more about tuning existing capabilities. No Match.
Horizontal Scaling: This tactic involves scaling by adding/removing servers, which isn't mentioned here as we're dealing with a single index loading and parameter adjustments. No Match.
Scheduling: The text does not involve allocating tasks over time or resources; it's about configuring an index for query performance. No Match.
Brokering: There is no mention of matching service requests to providers based on energy characteristics, so this doesn't apply. No Match.
Increase Efficiency: This tactic involves improving algorithm efficiency by optimizing critical algorithms or matching hardware best suited for tasks. The text discusses adjusting parameters (ef_search) that control the speed and accuracy trade-off in queries, which aligns with increasing time/memory performance to enhance energy efficiency. However, it's not explicitly about co-locating resources or reducing intermediaries but rather tuning an existing algorithm. There might be a match if we consider 'Increase Efficiency' as improving query performance through parameter adjustment.

Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: Active Redundancy - Not implemented as redundant nodes processing inputs simultaneously for this purpose, so No Match. Passive Redundancy - Not mentioned; no use of standby components with periodic updates here, so No Match. Spare - The text does not describe having cold or hot spares, but rather lazy initialization to avoid resource duplication until needed, which is different from spare tactics that explicitly maintain redundancy, so No Match.

Recover from Faults_Reintroduction: Shadow - Not used; no operation in shadow mode for recovery purposes mentioned here. State Resynchronization - Not discussed as part of fault recovery after a failure occurs, but rather about enabling parallel execution with isolated resources, so No Match. Escalating Restart - Not relevant to the described approach which is more about setup than recovery from failures during processing.

Prevent Faults: Removal from Service - Not mentioned; no action taken to remove components from service for fault prevention or handling here. Transactions - The text does not mention atomicity, consistency, etc., in message exchanges between distributed systems. It's about parallel execution of operations within a single process pool using the PoolExecutor API. Predictive Model - No indication that system conditions are monitored to predict future faults; it's more operational than preventative monitoring for fault prediction. Exception Prevention - The text does not describe techniques to prevent exceptions from occurring, but rather how to manage resources during parallel processing without explicitly preventing faults. Increase Competence Set - This tactic involves expanding the program's competence set of states to handle more cases normally. In this text, we're increasing the ability to run operations in parallel by using lazy initialization and post-fork setup, which is about operational efficiency rather than handling a wider range of states or exceptions.",None,"The described approach focuses on enabling efficient parallel execution through resource management techniques (lazy initialization and post-fork setup) but does not align with any specific architectural tactic from the provided list, as it is primarily about operational setup rather than fault detection or recovery."

","The text describes various methods for installing scispacy and its dependencies (nmslib), including using Mamba, pip install with flags, no-binary installation, git installation, upgrading pybind11, and setting up a virtual environment. It also mentions that some methods are unconfirmed and provides specific commands.",The text addresses the issue of installing scispacy and its dependencies in different ways to ensure compatibility and avoid errors during setup or operation.,"For each tactic, I will analyze if it applies based on the provided definitions.

- Split Module: The text does not discuss splitting modules; it's about installation methods. No Match.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: This is about moving responsibilities to reduce side effects. The text doesn't mention refactoring or changing module structures for coherence, but rather installation techniques. No Match.
- Encapsulate: Introduces an interface to limit change propagation. The text talks about virtual environments and dependency management (like using Mamba) which could be seen as encapsulation by isolating the environment. However, it's not explicitly defining interfaces or restricting dependencies within a module; it's more about system-level setup. No Match.
- Use an Intermediary: Breaks dependencies with intermediaries. The text uses Mamba (a package manager) to handle dependencies, which acts as an intermediary between the user and the complex installation process. This could be considered matching if we think of the environment setup as a form of intermediary. However, let's see if there's a better fit.
- Restrict Dependencies: Limits modules that interact with others. The text suggests using Mamba to create isolated environments, which restricts dependencies by containing them within the virtual environment. This seems applicable because it prevents conflicts from other system-wide packages.
- Refactor: Removes duplication and assigns common services elsewhere. Installation methods are not about code structure but about configuration or runtime binding. No Match.
- Abstract Common Services: Creates abstract forms to reduce modification costs. The text doesn't mention abstraction of services; it's about installation steps. No Match.
- Component Replacement: Binds values at compile time via build scripts. This is more about replacing components during build, not relevant here as the focus is on runtime or deployment-time installations. No Match.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Binds values at compile time through parameters. The text involves commands that are executed at different times (like startup), so it's not compile-time. No Match.
- Aspects: AOP for cross-cutting concerns, but the text is about installation and dependency management, no aspect-related code changes mentioned. No Match.
- Configuration-time Binding: Binds values during deployment via config files. The text uses commands (like pip install) which are not configuration files; they're direct instructions or scripts. However, some methods like using resource files could be considered if there were a file-based approach, but here it's command-line based. No Match.
- Resource Files: Uses external files for binding values at startup. The text doesn't mention any resource files being used for configuration during installation; all bindings are done via commands or environment setup. No Match.
- Runtime Registration: Binds values at runtime through registration mechanisms. Some methods like `pip install --no-binary :all:` might be considered, but it's more about how dependencies are built and installed rather than registered at runtime. The text doesn't describe a system that registers services dynamically during execution for binding purposes. No Match.
- Dynamic Lookup: Binds values by looking up services at runtime. This is not mentioned in the context of service lookup; installation methods don't involve dynamic service discovery or binding based on runtime conditions. No Match.
- Interpret Parameters: Binds values by interpreting parameters at runtime. The text doesn't show any parameter interpretation during execution for configuration purposes. Installation commands are static and direct. No Match.
- Startup Time Binding: Binds values during startup (e.g., via command-line or scripts). This could be a match because some installation methods involve steps that happen at startup, like activating the environment and then running pip install. However, let's see if there's something more specific.
- Name Servers: Not relevant to installation configuration; it's about runtime service discovery using name servers. No Match.
- Plug-ins: Binds values via plug-in mechanisms at runtime. The text doesn't mention loading plugins during execution for binding purposes. Installation is done via commands, not plugin systems. No Match.
- Publish-Subscribe: Not applicable to installation configuration; it's a messaging pattern. No Match.
- Shared Repositories: Binds values through shared data sources at runtime. This might relate if multiple components share the same repository during execution, but here we're talking about installation and dependency management, not runtime service binding via repositories. No Match.

Based on this analysis, the tactics that have a potential match are 'Use an Intermediary' (if Mamba is considered as intermediary) and 'Restrict Dependencies'. However, let's compare them to see which one fits better.",None,"The text describes installation methods for scispacy and its dependencies but does not explicitly discuss architectural tactics such as splitting modules or encapsulation in the context of code structure.

","The text describes the installation process of scispacy and its dependencies, including recommendations to use isolated Python environments (like virtualenv or conda), specific issues with installing nmslib on different operating systems and Python versions, and instructions for handling various cases.",The goal is to provide a reliable and secure installation method for scispacy by addressing potential difficulties in dependency management across multiple platforms and environments.,"For each tactic, I will analyze its applicability based on the text:

1. **Detect Intrusion**: The text does not mention any intrusion detection or malicious behavior patterns. It focuses on installation issues and workarounds.
   - Analysis: No match.
2. **Detect Service Denial**: Not related to service denial attacks; it's about dependency installation problems.
   - Analysis: No match.
3. **Verify Message Integrity**: The text does not discuss message integrity or hashing techniques for data verification.
   - Analysis: No match.
4. **Detect Message Delay**: Installation timing is mentioned, but no intent to detect man-in-the-middle attacks via delay.
   - Analysis: No match.
5. **Identify Actors**: Not applicable; the text does not involve identifying sources of external inputs or actors in a security context.
   - Analysis: No match.
6. **Authenticate Actors**: The text mentions using isolated environments and specific Python versions, but no authentication mechanism for users or systems.
   - Analysis: No match.
7. **Authorize Actors**: Not relevant; the focus is on installation dependencies, not access control.
   - Analysis: No match.
8. **Limit Access**: This could relate to restricting access during installation by using virtual environments, but it's more about preventing interference from other systems or users rather than limiting access post-installation.
   - Analysis: Partially applicable (virtualenv helps limit the environment), but not a strong match as per definitions.
9. **Limit Exposure**: The text recommends isolated environments to reduce exposure of dependencies and system resources, which aligns with minimizing attack surface during setup.
   - Analysis: Match.
10. **Encrypt Data**: No mention of encryption for data or communication in the context of installation issues.
    - Analysis: No match.
11. **Separate Entities**: The text does not discuss separating different components (like services) physically or logically beyond recommending virtual environments, which is a form of separation but not explicitly stated as such.
    - Analysis: Partially applicable (virtualenv separates the environment), but definitions require explicit separation for security reasons.
12. **Change Default Settings**: The text does not mention changing default settings to prevent attacks; it's about installation instructions and workarounds.
    - Analysis: No match.
13. **Revoke Access**: Not related, as there is no ongoing attack scenario mentioned in the context of installation.
    - Analysis: No match.
14. **Lock Computer**: The text does not describe locking a computer due to repeated failed attempts; it's about dependency issues and environment recommendations.
    - Analysis: No match.
15. **Inform Actors**: There is no mention of notifying personnel or systems when an attack is detected, which doesn't apply here as the context is installation problems, not attacks.

- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction

You can also find attached a list of other less common errors I screened ([other_errors.txt](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/files/3111859/other_errors.txt)), but I think even just identify a solution for and/or handling these cases would be great since they represent the majority of errors (~75%) in the BioNLP09 corpus! . What would you recommend for handling these cases? Are they easily manageable by adding tokenization rules or you suggest to have a custom module to workaround the problem? Thank you very much indeed! Alan. _____. **Oversplitting after +/-""**. Example 1. - PDBu + iono induced equally high IL-2 levels in both groups and, when stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the IL-2 secretion by neonatal cells was undetectable and adult cells produced low amounts of IL-2 (mean 331 +/-. - 86 pg/ml). Example 2. - The addition of anti-CD28 mAb to anti-CD3-stimulated cells markedly increased IL-2 production in both cell types, but levels of IL-2 in neonatal T cells remained clearly lower than those of adult T cells (respective mean values: 385 ""
","Alan reports on using the scispacy `en_core_sci_md` model for BioNLP09 corpus and observes improved sentence segmentation accuracy but identifies recurring errors, primarily oversplitting after +/- or at dots in abbreviations. He suggests that these cases (~75% of errors) are significant and proposes solutions like adding tokenization rules or creating a custom module.","The text describes the need to handle specific error cases (oversplitting and undersplitting) in sentence segmentation for the BioNLP09 corpus, indicating an architectural goal to improve accuracy by addressing these recurring issues effectively.","[{""tactic_name"": ""Ping/Echo"", ""analysis"": ""The text does not mention any asynchronous request/response mechanism between nodes.

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Text To Analyze:
""Pin scispacy to 2.1.x; The current models are not compatible with spacy 2.2. Pinning the scispacy version until we can upgrade to 2.2 and release new models.""
","The text discusses pinning a Python package 'scispacy' to an older version (2.1.x) due to incompatibility with newer versions of spaCy, specifically because current models are not compatible.","The goal is to maintain compatibility by preventing the use of incompatible components, likely to avoid breaking existing functionality or deployments.","Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules, so No Match.
Increase Semantic Coherence: Not related to semantic coherence or moving responsibilities, so No Match.
Encapsulate: No explicit interface is introduced, so No Match.
Use an Intermediary: No intermediary is mentioned, so No Match.
Restrict Dependencies: The text implies restricting the version of scispacy by pinning it, which could be a form of dependency restriction. However, the tactic 'Restrict Dependencies' in the list might not directly match this description as provided. Let's analyze further based on definitions.
Refactor: Refactoring typically involves restructuring code to improve design without changing behavior. Pinning a version is more about configuration than refactoring code itself, so No Match.
Abstract Common Services: Not mentioned or implied, so No Match.
Component Replacement: This tactic involves binding values by replacing components at build time. The text does not describe replacement but rather pinning to an older version until upgrade, which might be closer to a different form of binding (like configuration-time). So No Match.
Compile-time Parameterization: Not applicable as the pinning is done via dependency specification in package managers or setup files, not compile-time parameterization. No Match.
Aspects: Aspects are for cross-cutting concerns and compile-time weaving, not relevant here. No Match.
Configuration-time Binding: This involves binding at deployment time through configuration. Pinning a version might be considered as part of dependency management during setup or build, but the text does not specify it's done via configuration files; it's more about specifying in requirements. However, let's see if there's a closer match.
Resource Files: Not related to pinning packages. No Match.
Runtime Registration: Binding at runtime through registration is not what this text describes. Pinning happens before runtime. No Match.
Dynamic Lookup: This involves binding services dynamically at runtime, which doesn't fit the static pinning described. No Match.
Interpret Parameters: Not applicable; parameters are being interpreted in terms of version numbers? The tactic refers to binding values by interpreting parameters, but here it's about specifying a fixed version. No Match.
Startup Time Binding: This is part of Defer Binding category and involves binding during startup. Pinning scispacy might be done at the time of setting up the environment or deployment configuration, which could loosely relate if we consider that as binding at startup. However, pinning in requirements files typically happens much earlier than runtime.
Plug-ins: Not related to plug-ins; this is about fixed version dependencies. No Match.
Publish-Subscribe: This is for decoupling components via messaging patterns, not relevant here. No Match.
Shared Repositories: Not applicable as there's no mention of shared data stores or repositories. No Match.
Polymorphism: Binding at runtime through polymorphism doesn't match the static pinning approach. No Match.",None,"The text describes a version pinning to maintain compatibility, but none of the provided tactics directly address this specific issue as it relates more to dependency management than architectural refactoring or binding techniques."

[Follow the installation instructions for Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). 2. Create a Conda environment called scispacy with Python 3.9 (any version >= 3.6 should work):. ```bash. mamba create -n scispacy python=3.10. ```. 3. Activate the Mamba environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy. ```bash. mamba activate scispacy. ```. Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above. Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:. ```python. import spacy. nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""). doc = nlp(""Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.""). ```. Note on upgrading. If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, ""

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.

- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Increase Semantic Coherence: Not mentioned or relevant here; the focus is on installation methods. So No Match.
Encapsulate: The text talks about using virtual environments to isolate dependencies, which aligns with encapsulation by limiting interactions between components (like different Python versions). This could be a match for reducing coupling through isolation.
Use an Intermediary: Not directly addressed; the text uses pip and git but doesn't mention intermediaries. No Match.
Restrict Dependencies: The use of virtual environments like Mamba/Conda restricts dependencies by isolating the environment, so this is applicable here. This could be a match for reducing coupling.
Refactor: Refactoring isn't mentioned in the text; it's about installation. No Match.
Abstract Common Services: Not relevant to installation instructions. The text doesn't abstract services but provides binding methods. No Match.
Component Replacement: The text mentions installing via pip or from source, which could be seen as replacing components (like models) when upgrading scispaCy, so this might apply. However, the primary action is not replacement during setup but rather installation and dependency management.
Compile-time Parameterization: Not used in the described methods; everything happens at runtime or build time via pip commands. No Match.
Aspects: Aspect-oriented programming isn't referenced here. The text doesn't use aspects for binding values. No Match.
Configuration-time Binding: Configuration is mentioned briefly (e.g., upgrade instructions), but not as a tactic in the context of installation methods provided. No Match.
Resource Files: Not used; no resource files are involved in these bindings. No Match.

Dynamic Lookup: Not mentioned or relevant to service binding via installation commands. No Match.
Interpret Parameters: This could refer to interpreting command-line parameters for installation (e.g., CFLAGS), but the tactic definitions are more abstract than this specific use case. Let's see if it fits under Defer Binding principles by allowing runtime interpretation of values during setup. It might be a match, though not strongly.
Startup Time Binding: The text mentions installing via pip and then loading models, which happens at startup time for some bindings (like the one with CFLAGS). This could apply to binding dependencies when starting the application.
Name Servers: Not relevant; no name servers are used in installation. No Match.
Plug-ins: Plug-in mechanisms aren't discussed here. The text is about direct installation methods, not plugins. No Match.
Publish-Subscribe: Not applicable; this pattern isn't mentioned or implied by the installation tactics described. No Match.
Shared Repositories: This tactic involves sharing data at runtime via repositories, but the text doesn't describe such a mechanism for binding values during setup. It's about installing from specific sources (like GitHub) with version constraints. No Match.
Polymorphism: Not directly related to these installation methods; it's more about how models are loaded without specifying their internal structure changes due to different versions.

This makes it straightforward to cache a small region of a full chromosome without having to store the entire chromosome sequence in memory (potentially big!).""
","The text describes an InMemoryFfastaReader that uses ReferenceSequence protos stored in memory, providing similar functionality to GenomeReferenceFAI but accessing data from an in-memory cache instead of disk files. It allows caching small regions without storing the whole chromosome sequence.","The goal is to provide efficient access to genomic sequences by using an in-memory representation and caching mechanism, reducing I/O operations or memory footprint for large datasets.","Split Module: The text does not mention splitting a module into smaller ones. It describes the functionality of one specific reader class.
Increase Semantic Coherence: No discussion about moving responsibilities to different modules or improving internal consistency.
Encapsulate: There is an explicit interface (GetBases) mentioned, but no details on how it reduces propagation of changes through interfaces.
Use an Intermediary: Not applicable; the text does not describe breaking dependencies with intermediaries.
Restrict Dependencies: No mention of restricting which modules interact or depend on each other.
Refactor: The text describes functionality rather than refactoring common services out. It doesn't explicitly factor out code for reuse elsewhere.
Abstract Common Services: There is a reference to similar APIs, but no explicit abstract service implementation mentioned.
Component Replacement: This tactic involves replacing components at build time. The InMemoryFastaReader replaces the on-disk access with in-memory caching, which fits the description of component replacement (binding through replacement).
Compile-time Parameterization: No parameterization during compile time is discussed; binding happens dynamically based on cache content.
Aspects: Aspect-oriented programming isn't mentioned or implied by this text.
Configuration-time Binding: The functionality doesn't involve configuration files for binding values at deployment time.
Resource Files: Not using resource files to bind data, as the bases are stored in memory and accessed via an interface.
Runtime Registration: No registration process is described; it's a direct fetch from cache based on parameters.
Dynamic Lookup: This involves runtime lookup of services or objects. The GetBases operation directly accesses the tuple without dynamic service discovery.
Interpret Parameters: The text mentions interpreting parameters (e.g., start and end positions) to determine which part of the bases string to use, so this tactic seems applicable.
Startup Time Binding: No binding at startup time is described; it's done on-demand during operation.
Name Servers: Not mentioned or relevant here.
Plug-ins: The system doesn't appear to be extensible with plug-ins for different data sources.
Publish-Subscribe: This pattern isn't used in the description of this reader class.
Shared Repositories: No shared repositories are involved; each instance has its own cache.
Polymorphism: While there might be polymorphic behavior if multiple readers exist, it's not explicitly tied to binding values at runtime.",Component Replacement,"The InMemoryFastaReader replaces the on-disk GenomeReferenceFAI by providing an alternative implementation that uses in-memory caching instead of file access, aligning with the Component Replacement tactic which binds functionality through build-time or script-based replacement."

## Text To Analyze:
""File cache + test speedups; - Adds `file_cache.py`, a really simple file cache which lets you do . ```. from SciSpaCy.file_cache import cached_path. Looks in the cache for the dataset - if it's not there,. download it automatically. dataset = dataset_loading_function(cached_path(""https://...."")). ```. - Removes path modification to run the tests by making `tests/` a python module. - Adds two scripts `scripts/pylint.sh` and `scripts/mypy.sh` which run the linters with some nice formatting options. - Speeds up the test suite by about 10x(360s -> 24s on my macbook) by caching spacy model loading. . Loading the models takes up quite a bit of time (like a couple of seconds) and the parametrised tests load them independently. Perhaps a slightly better testing model would be to have classes with state, but this also works. Lmk if you don't like it or something, it means you have to be a little bit careful not to modify the state of global spacy `nlp`'s in the tests.""

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes a new feature for automatic acquisition of hyponyms from large text corpora using SpaCy Matcher. It explains that passing `extended=True` increases recall but decreases precision, and it produces a doc level attribute with tuples of extracted hyponym pairs. There is also mention of an Ontonotes Mixin fix by Yoav Goldberg to normalize dependency labels for different data formats.","The text focuses on implementing a new feature that extracts hyponyms from text corpora, specifically mentioning the use of SpaCy and its Matcher component. It highlights trade-offs in precision and recall when using extended patterns, indicating an effort to enhance functionality while managing performance or accuracy aspects. The mention of fixing data formats suggests addressing interoperability issues.","For each tactic, I will analyze if it applies based on the text summary.

1. **Discover Service**: This involves locating a service through searching a known directory at runtime. In the text, there is no mention of services being located or searched in a directory. The focus is on extracting hyponyms and fixing data formats, which are more about processing than discovery. Therefore, this tactic does not match.

2. **Orchestrate**: This uses a control mechanism to coordinate multiple services that might be unaware of each other. In the text, there is no indication of coordinating or orchestrating multiple services. The hyponym extraction process seems to be handled by a single component (HyponymDetector) and does not involve managing sequences of service invocations from different parts. Therefore, this tactic does not match.

3. **Tailor Interface**: This adds or removes capabilities to an interface, such as translation, buffering, or hiding functions. In the text, there is a mention of fixing data formats (Ontonotes Mixin) and normalizing dependency labels for consistency between corpora. This involves modifying how information is presented or accessed by adjusting the input/output format based on specific requirements (like different corpora). While not explicitly about interfaces in the traditional sense, it aligns with tailoring the interface to handle different data formats consistently.

- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.

This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1.

- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Use an Intermediary: Not directly addressed in the text; no mention of breaking dependencies with intermediaries like adapters or proxies.
Restrict Dependencies: The use of virtual environments (Mamba/Conda) restricts dependencies by isolating the environment and specifying Python versions. This is a clear match for restricting dependencies through visibility or authorization mechanisms.
Refactor: No discussion about removing duplication from modules, so No Match.
Abstract Common Services: Not mentioned in the text; no indication of abstracting services to reduce modification costs.
Component Replacement: The text does not mention replacing components with others during installation, but rather installing specific versions. However, it could be interpreted as binding different configurations (like models) at install time which might involve component replacement if we consider that different components are being bound based on the environment setup. But this is a stretch; the primary action isn't replacement.
Compile-time Parameterization: Installation methods don't bind values at compile time through parameters, so No Match.
Aspects: Not mentioned in the text; no aspect-based binding or crosscutting concerns addressed.
Configuration-time Binding: The installation via pip with specific flags might be considered configuration-time if we think of build scripts. But it's more about runtime dependency management. However, using virtual environments and specifying Python versions could be seen as part of deployment configuration.
Resource Files: Not mentioned; no use of resource files for binding values during startup or initialization.
Runtime Registration: The text does not describe registering bindings at runtime.
Dynamic Lookup: No mention of dynamic lookup services in the context of installation.
Interpret Parameters: Installation flags might be interpreted as parameters, but they are static and part of the command. Not a strong match for runtime interpretation.
Startup Time Binding: Setting up virtual environments during startup could be considered, but it's more about pre-installation setup. The text doesn't explicitly bind values at startup time.
Name Servers: No mention in the context of installation or dependency binding.
Plug-ins: Installation via git might involve loading plugins, but not directly described as such.
Publish-Subscribe: Not relevant to this text; no messaging patterns discussed.
Shared Repositories: The text does not discuss shared repositories for runtime binding.
Polymorphism: No indication that different behaviors are bound at runtime through polymorphism.",Restrict Dependencies,"The selected tactic is 'Restrict Dependencies' because the text explicitly mentions using virtual environments to isolate and specify dependencies, thereby reducing the probability of unintended interactions between modules."
