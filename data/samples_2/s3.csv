- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.

- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.

- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.

- **Reduce Size of a Module**: The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing their size. It talks about changing model inputs and features, but no explicit module reduction is described.
  Applicability: Low (No Match)

- **Increase Cohesion** under `Increase Semantic Coherence`: This tactic involves moving responsibilities to different modules if they don't serve the same purpose. The text mentions training data from various sources (WGS and WES) but does not indicate that unrelated responsibilities were moved or split for better coherence.
  Applicability: Low (No Match)

- **Reduce Coupling** under `Encapsulate`: This involves introducing an explicit interface to reduce propagation of changes. The text does not mention interfaces being introduced.
  Applicability: No

- **Reduce Coupling** under `Use an Intermediary`: Breaking dependencies with intermediaries is mentioned, but the text doesn't describe using such a mechanism explicitly.
  Applicability: Low (No Match)

- **Reduce Coupling** under `Restrict Dependencies`: The text mentions that training data excludes certain samples and chromosomes to reduce coupling. This could be seen as restricting dependencies by not including specific data, thus reducing the impact of changes related to those data.
  However, this is more about input restriction than general coupling reduction through interfaces or visibility controls.
  Applicability: Medium (No Match)

- **Reduce Coupling** under `Refactor`: Factoring out common responsibilities. The text mentions using downsample fractions for training examples and starting from a WGS checkpoint to train on WES, which could be seen as refactoring the model input handling.
  Applicability: Medium (No Match)

- **Reduce Coupling** under `Abstract Common Services`: Not explicitly mentioned in the text. The changes are about data representation rather than abstracting services.
  Applicibility: Low (No Match)

- **Defer Binding** under various methods: The text mentions deterministic output by rounding QUAL fields, which implies binding at a specific time to ensure consistency. Also, it talks about training on different datasets and using downsample fractions, but these are not explicitly deferred bindings.
  However, the use of checkpoints (starting from WGS model) could be seen as deferring some aspects until needed.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

This suggests a goal of minimizing runtime overhead and ensuring reliable access to required components without network dependencies.","Evaluating each tactic:

- **Reduce Size of a Module**: The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing their size, so this is a No Match.

- **Increase Cohesion**: There's no discussion about moving responsibilities between modules to reduce side effects. The focus is on pre-installation, which doesn't directly relate to cohesion in the traditional sense (grouping related functionalities). This is a No Match.

- **Reduce Coupling**:
  - *Encapsulate*: Not explicitly mentioned, but by making dependencies static through Dockerfile setup, coupling might be reduced. However, no direct encapsulation step described. Analysis shows potential reduction in coupling due to pre-installation.
  - *Use an Intermediary*: No intermediary is introduced or discussed for binding values. This is a No Match.
  - *Restrict Dependencies*: The user wants to restrict the runtime environment from accessing download capabilities, which aligns with this tactic by making dependencies explicit and controlled via Dockerfile. There's no mention of restricting through visibility/authorization, but pre-installation does control what's available at runtime. This is a Match.
  - *Refactor*: No refactoring or moving common responsibilities mentioned. The text focuses on installation method changes. This is a No Match.
  - *Abstract Common Services*: Not discussed; the user wants to avoid downloading by pre-installing, not necessarily abstracting services. This is a No Match.

- **Defer Binding**:
  Compile-time Parameterization: By using `RUN pip install` in Dockerfile instead of runtime download, values (like model paths) are bound at build time rather than runtime. The user's intent to pre-install via Dockerfile aligns with compile-time binding for the installation step.
  Configuration-time Binding: Not mentioned; no configuration files or deployment-time setup described.
  Runtime Registration/Binding: Explicitly avoided by wanting to prevent downloads, so this is a No Match.
  Dynamic Lookup: Opposite of what's desired (avoiding runtime lookup/download). This is a No Match.
  Interpret Parameters: Not relevant here. This is a No Match.
  Startup Time Binding: The user wants to avoid startup-time binding as well since they don't want downloads at runtime, but the Dockerfile `RUN` command binds dependencies during build (which is similar to compile time). However, the text doesn't explicitly describe this tactic's application in terms of startup binding. There might be a slight connection.
  Name Servers: Not mentioned or relevant. This is a No Match.
  Plug-ins: The user mentions adding pipes via Dockerfile command, but no plug-in mechanism for deferred binding. This is a No Match.
  Publish-Subscribe: Not related to the installation issue. This is a No Match.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults

It focuses on analyzing genomic data for variant detection, which is unrelated to resource monitoring.

Vertical Scaling: There is no discussion of adding or removing computational resources (like servers) to meet processing demands. The focus is on algorithmic improvements and model training.

Horizontal Scaling: No mention of scaling up by adding more servers or VMs; the text talks about adjusting parameters within a single system for better variant calling.

Scheduling: Not applicable, as there's no task allocation based on energy usage mentioned in the context of genomic analysis.

Brokering: The concept of matching service requests with providers is not relevant here. DeepVariant is an internal tool or model used by Google, and the text does not involve selecting different computational resources for energy reasons.

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

For example, if master is not sharded, none of the other specs can be sharded, and vice versa. They must all also have a consistent sharding (e.g., master is @10, then all others must be @10). Note that filespecs (except the master) may be None or any other False value, which are returned as-is in the output list. Args: shard: int >= 0. Our shard number. filespecs: list[str]. Contains all of the filespecs we want to resolve into shard-specific file paths. Returns: A list. The first element is the number of shards, which is an int >= 1 when filespecs contains sharded paths and 0 if none do. All subsequent returned values follow the shard-specific paths for each filespec, in order. Raises: ValueError: if any filespecs are inconsistent.""
",The text describes a function that resolves potentially sharded file specifications into concrete file paths based on a master specification and a given shard number.,"This text addresses the need to handle distributed systems with sharding, ensuring consistency in how files are accessed across multiple shards. The goal is likely to improve system reliability by preventing inconsistencies or errors related to sharded file specifications.","Detect Faults: This tactic involves identifying faults through mechanisms like heartbeat or echo. The text does not mention any fault detection mechanism; it focuses on transforming and constraining filespecs, which is more about ensuring consistency than detecting faults.
Monitor: A component that checks system health. The text describes a function with constraints but no monitoring of system components' health.
Heartbeat: Periodic message exchange for fault detection. Not mentioned in the text; it's about transforming specs, not exchanging messages.
Timestamp: Assigning timestamps to events for sequence checking. No mention here; the focus is on sharding and consistency checks.
Sanity Checking: Validating operations or outputs. The function does perform validity checks by constraining filespecs based on a master spec, so this could be applicable.
Condition Monitoring: Checking conditions to prevent faulty behavior. Not directly mentioned; it's about checking constraints but not monitoring system conditions in real-time.
Voting: Using multiple identical inputs for inconsistency detection. The text does not involve voting logic or multiple components with the same input.
Exception Detection: Detecting altered execution flow. No indication of detecting exceptions, only ensuring consistency and raising errors if inconsistent.
Self-Test: Components testing themselves. Not applicable here; it's about transforming external filespecs based on constraints.
Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: This category includes redundancy and prevention mechanisms. The function does not involve recovery or preparation for repair but focuses on transformation with consistency checks, which might prevent errors by ensuring uniformity.
Active Redundancy: Processing identical inputs in parallel. Not relevant; the text describes a single function resolving specs without multiple nodes processing simultaneously.
Passive Redundancy: Active members process input, passive spares update periodically. No redundancy mechanisms are described here.
Spare: Cold sparing for fail-over. Not mentioned or implied in this text.
Exception Handling: Masking faults after detection. The function raises a ValueError if inconsistent but does not handle exceptions by masking them; it's more about validation than handling.
Rollback: Reverting to previous state. No mention of reverting states, only transforming based on constraints.
Software Upgrade: Upgrading code without affecting service. Not applicable here.
Retry: Retrying operations for transient faults. The text does not suggest retrying the operation; it's about validation and transformation.
Ignore Faulty Behavior: Ignoring spurious messages. This is about ignoring invalid data, but in a distributed system context with sharding, which might be seen as preventing or handling errors rather than specifically ignoring faulty behavior.
Degradation: Maintaining critical functions by dropping less critical ones. Not mentioned; the function ensures consistency and does not degrade functionality.
Reconfiguration: Reassigning responsibilities after failure. No reassignment is described here.
Recover from Faults_Reintroduction: This involves reintroducing failed components or resynchronizing them. The text describes a transformation process but no recovery mechanism for faults, only prevention through constraints.
Shadow: Operating a failed component in shadow mode. Not applicable; the function does not involve operating previously failed components.

## Text To Analyze:
""e input TFRecord. The output here is a TFRecord of. CallVariantsOutput protos. `call_variants` doesn't directly support sharding its. outputs, but accepts a glob or shard-pattern for its inputs. `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and uses TensorFlow for evaluation. When evaluating a model in CPU mode, TensorFlow can make use of multiple cores,. but scaling is sub-linear. In other words, `call_variants` on a 64 core machine. is less than 8x faster than running on a 8 core machine. When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs. fewer CPUs. Based on a small number of experiments, currently the most efficient. configuration for `call_variants` on a GPU instance is 4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU. Compared to our setting in the [whole genome case study], we noticed a 2.5x. speedup on the call_variants step using a single P100 GPU and 8 CPUs. Note that. currently `call_variants` can only use one GPU at most. So it doesn't improve. the speed if you get a multiple-GPU machine. postprocess_variants. `postprocess_variants` reads all of the output TFRecord files from. `call_variants`, sorts them, combines multi-allelic records, and writes out a. VCF file. When [gVCF output](deepvariant-gvcf-support.md) is requested, it also. outputs a gVCF file which merges the VCF with the non-variant sites. Because `postprocess_variants` combines and sorts the output of `call_variants`,. it needs to see all of the outputs from `call_variants` for a single sample to. merge into a final VCF. `postprocess_variants` is single-threaded and needs a. non-trivial amount of memory to run (20-30 GB), so it is best run on a. single/dual core machine with sufficient memory. Updates on DeepVariant since precisionFDA truth challenge and bioRxiv preprint. The DeepVariant team has been hard at work since we first presented the method. Key changes and improvements include:. * Rearchitected with open source release in mind. * Built on [TensorFlow]. * Increased variant calling""
","The text discusses a tool called `call_variants` that processes TFRecord files using TensorFlow, noting its energy efficiency when run on GPUs with specific CPU configurations (4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU). It also mentions the speedup achieved compared to previous settings. Additionally, it describes another component `postprocess_variants` which is single-threaded and requires significant memory.","The text addresses performance optimization in computational tasks, specifically variant calling using DeepVariant with TensorFlow. It highlights energy efficiency improvements by rearchitecting the system for better resource utilization (CPU/GPU) and mentions scaling issues to prevent overprovisioning or unnecessary overhead.","[Evaluate each tactic one by one]:

1. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - The text does not explicitly describe any method of collecting real-time energy data, nor static or dynamic classification based on device characteristics. It focuses more on performance metrics and configurations.
   - However, it mentions efficiency improvements (speedup) which could be linked to monitoring resource usage implicitly for optimization purposes.
   - **Conclusion**: No Match

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - The text describes scaling `call_variants` by using a specific number of CPUs and GPUs (4-8 CPUs, 1 GPU). This aligns with horizontal scaling (adding/removing resources) or scheduling (allocating tasks to optimize energy).
   - It also mentions that vertical scaling might be used if needed.
   - **Conclusion**: Match

3. **Resource Adaptation**:
   - The text talks about using GPUs for better efficiency, which is a form of service adaptation by dynamically switching resources based on performance gains.
   - However, it does not explicitly mention increasing algorithmic efficiency or reducing overhead through co-location; instead, it focuses on hardware configuration changes.
   - **Conclusion**: Partial Match (due to resource switching but less clear on optimization techniques)

4. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - The text mentions that `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and can be run with more CPUs or GPUs, which is horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling would involve adding resources within a single node (e.g., more memory to the same machine). However, it does not explicitly describe vertical scaling.
   - **Conclusion**: No Match

5. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - The text describes using multiple CPUs and GPUs for `call_variants` with specific configurations (4-08 CPUs, 1 GPU) which is horizontal scaling by adding resources to an existing pool.
   - It also mentions that the speedup was achieved by rearchitecting on TensorFlow, implying a change in resource allocation strategy.
   - **Conclusion**: Match

6. **Scheduling**:
   - The text does not explicitly mention task scheduling or allocating tasks based on energy constraints; it focuses more on configuration settings and performance metrics.
   - However, the rearchitecture might imply some form of implicit scheduling for better resource utilization.
   - **Conclusion**: No Match

7. **Brokering**:
   - The text does not describe matching service requests with providers based on energy characteristics; it focuses solely on internal configuration changes.
   - **Conclusion**: No Match

8. **Service Adaptation**:
   - This tactic involves dynamically switching computational resources for better efficiency or lower costs. In the text, `call_variants` is adapted to use GPUs instead of CPUs (or in addition) which improves speed and reduces CPU requirements.
   - The text states: ""When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs fewer CPUs."" This clearly indicates adaptation based on energy efficiency or performance gains.
   - **Conclusion**: Match

9. **Increase Efficiency**:
   - The tactic involves improving algorithmic time/memory performance to enhance energy efficiency. In the text, `call_variants` is built on TensorFlow which likely improves its computational efficiency (time and memory) leading to better energy usage.
   - However, it does not explicitly state that they improved an algorithm's internal performance; instead, it focuses on hardware configuration changes.
   - **Conclusion**: No Match

10. **Reduce Overhead**:
    - This tactic aims to co-locate resources and remove intermediaries to reduce overhead. The text mentions reducing CPU requirements by using GPUs but does not explicitly talk about removing abstractions or intermediaries; it's more about resource allocation.
    - However, the reduction in required CPUs could be seen as a way to reduce overhead (computational load).

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

14,deployability,", I think it's very useful! I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**. From the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf), I understand that scispacy links entities to UMLS concepts from sections 0, 1, 2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS 2017 AA release"". Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. . **Custom UMLS linker**. Somewhat related to 234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)? The reason I'm asking is twofold:. 1. UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy. Unless you're planning to do frequent updates on the model, I'd like to be able to use the most frequent concepts. 2.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.

## Text To Analyze:
"", I think it's very useful! I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**. From the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf), I understand that scispacy links entities to UMLS concepts from sections 0, 1, 2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS 2017 AA release"". Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. . **Custom UMLS linker**. Somewhat related to 234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)? The reason I'm asking is twofold:. 1. UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy. Unless you're planning to do frequent updates on the model, I'd like to be able to use the most frequent concepts. 2. UMLS is highly customisable; users can select their own subsets of the many [vocabularies](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html). It would be great if this customisability is also applied in scispacy. My understanding is that it is possible by:. - Converting a UMLS `MRCONSO.RFF` file to JSON using [export_uml_json.py](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/export_uml_json.py). - Generating a [KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/linking_utils.py#L45) object . - Training a new linker using [create_tfidf_ann_index()](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L325 ). Is this correct? Any help or more detailed instructions would be greatly appreciated!""
","The text discusses the UMLS Entity Linker, specifically mentioning a generic linker that uses sections 0,1,2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS database. It also proposes creating a custom linker by using local UMLS subsets for users with licenses, which involves converting files to JSON, generating a KnowledgeBase object, and training a new model.","The text addresses improving system functionality by enabling more accurate entity linking (e.g., including COVID-19 concepts) and increasing flexibility through customization options. It also aims to reduce dependency on fixed data versions by allowing users to update with their own UMLS subsets.","For tactic 'Reduce Size of a Module': The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing module size, so it is not applicable.

For tactic 'Increase Cohesion': There is no discussion about semantic coherence or moving responsibilities between modules. The focus is on functionality and flexibility, not cohesion.

For tactic 'Reduce Coupling': This could be relevant as the custom linker approach might reduce coupling by decoupling the model from fixed UMLS releases. However, the text does not explicitly describe any intermediary or encapsulation technique to achieve this reduction in coupling.

For tactics under 'Defer Binding', such as Component Replacement, Compile-time Parameterization, etc.: The text describes a method that allows binding values (UMLS concepts) at runtime by training on custom subsets. This aligns with several Defer Binding tactics like Runtime Registration or Dynamic Lookup.",Reduce Overhead,"The selected tactic is 'Reduce Overhead' because the text discusses reducing memory usage and improving performance through efficient indexing and caching, as indicated by the mention of TF-IDF vectors being cached in a vector store for faster lookups.","Reduced overhead (e.g., improved response time or resource utilization) by efficiently storing and accessing data structures like TF-IDF vectors using an index that caches them in a vector store, minimizing redundant computations during entity linking.",None

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Increase Efficiency: The text describes adding a file cache and scripts to improve test speed (by about 10x). While this improves performance which can lead to energy savings indirectly, it doesn't explicitly mention matching hardware or improving algorithms for efficiency in the context of energy. However, caching does reduce redundant computation, so there might be an indirect match but not direct. Let's say No Match.

Reduce Overhead: The text mentions reducing test suite runtime by about 10x through caching and avoiding path modifications. This reduces computational overhead (time) which can correlate with reduced energy demands. Also, the file cache avoids redundant downloads/loads, thus lowering system overhead. So this tactic seems applicable.",Reduce Overhead,"The text describes reducing test suite runtime by caching and avoiding path modifications in tests, directly aligning with the 'Reduce Overhead' tactic which aims to co-locate resources and remove intermediaries to lower computational demands.",Reduces test execution time significantly (by about 10x).,Test suite runtime reduced from 360s to 24s.

","The text describes an issue with installing nmslib in various Python environments, particularly on different operating systems and Python versions. It provides a matrix of compatibility across Windows (including Subsystem for Linux), Macs (M1, M2, M3, Intel), and mentions specific installation methods that work or don't work normally via pip, including the use of tools like mamba, CFLAGS parameters, git installations, and virtual environments.","The text addresses a problem in software installation and compatibility across different environments. The goal is to provide users with clear guidance on how to install nmslib successfully by specifying conditions under which it works or doesn't work, thereby reducing the difficulty of installation and improving maintainability across diverse systems.","Evaluating each tactic:

1. **Reduce Size of a Module** - Splitting modules is not mentioned in the text. The focus is on compatibility issues rather than module size reduction.
   Applicability: Low, as there's no indication that modules are being split or reduced for this purpose.
   Conclusion: No Match.

2. **Increase Cohesion**: The text does not discuss making modules more cohesive by grouping related responsibilities. It focuses on installation problems and solutions across environments.
   Applicability: None observed, as cohesion is about internal structure of code which isn't addressed here.
   Conclusion: No Match.

3. **Reduce Coupling** - This tactic involves reducing dependencies between modules to prevent propagation of changes. The text mentions restricting the environment (Python version) and using tools like mamba or specific pip commands, but these are about external dependencies rather than internal module coupling.
   Applicability: Medium, as there's a mention of 'restricting' environments which could be analogous to reducing coupling by limiting interactions.
   Conclusion: No Match.

4. **Defer Binding**: The text discusses binding values at different times (compile time, runtime) and through various methods like configuration-time binding via Mamba or specific pip commands that set flags for compilation. This is directly related to how dependencies are resolved in the installation process.
   Applicability: High, as multiple tactics under Defer Binding are mentioned including compile-time parameterization, configuration-time binding, resource files (though not explicitly), and runtime registration/lookup via different methods.
   Conclusion: Match.",Defer binding,"The text describes various installation methods that bind dependencies at different times (e.g., using Mamba for compile-time binding or specific pip commands) to handle compatibility issues, which aligns with the Defer Binding tactic's goal of reducing modification costs by deferring value bindings.","By providing a matrix and detailed instructions on installing nmslib in various environments, including different Python versions and operating systems, the system becomes more adaptable to user-specific setups without requiring changes to the core code structure.",None

This component implements [Automatic Aquisition of Hyponyms from Large Text Corpora](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C92-2082.pdf) using the SpaCy Matcher component. Passing `extended=True` to the `HyponymDetector` will use the extended set of hearst patterns, which include higher recall but lower precision hyponymy relations (e.g X compared to Y, X similar to Y, etc). This component produces a doc level attribute on the spacy doc: `doc._.hearst_patterns`, which is a list containing tuples of extracted hyponym pairs. The tuples contain:. - The relation rule used to extract the hyponym (type: `str`). - The more general concept (type: `spacy.Span`). - The more specific concept (type: `spacy.Span`). Usage:. ```python. import spacy. from scispacy.hyponym_detector import HyponymDetector. nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""). hyponym_pipe = HyponymDetector(nlp, extended=True). nlp.add_pipe(hyponym_pipe, last=True). doc = nlp(""Keystone plant species such as fig trees are good for the soil.""). print(doc._.hearst_patterns). >>> [('such_as', Keystone plant species, fig trees)]. ```.

","The text describes a matrix for testing nmslib installation across various environments and Python versions, including specific instructions for setting up Conda environments with different Python versions.","The goal is to provide clear installation guidance by documenting compatibility issues and alternative methods, thereby reducing errors during setup and improving maintainability of the system.","[Evaluate each tactic]:

- **Reduce Size of a Module**: The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing their size. It focuses on installation across environments.
  - Match: No

- **Increase Cohesion** (via Increase Semantic Coherence): This tactic involves moving responsibilities to different modules for better coherence, but the text is about environment compatibility and installation methods, not module responsibility changes.
  - Match: No

- **Reduce Coupling** (via various sub-tactics):
  - **Encapsulate**: The text does not introduce an explicit interface; it's about setup instructions.
    - Match: No
  - **Use an Intermediary**: Not applicable, no intermediary is mentioned.
    - Match: No
  - **Restrict Dependencies**: The text mentions setting up virtual environments (Conda) which might restrict dependencies by isolating the environment, but it's not explicitly about restricting module interactions.
    - Analysis: Conda environments can be seen as a way to manage dependencies, but this is tangential. The primary focus isn't reducing coupling between modules.
  - **Refactor**: Not mentioned; no common responsibilities being factored out.
    - Match: No
  - **Abstract Common Services**: Not discussed in the text.
    - Match: No

- **Defer Binding** (via various sub-tactics):
  - The text discusses installation methods that depend on environment and Python version, which aligns with deferring binding by using different mechanisms for each case. For example:
    - ✅ = works normally via pip install.
    - ❌🐍 = can be installed via mamba (which is a dependency manager).
    - 💻 = installation command including CFLAGS parameterization.
    - 🧠 = installation with specific plug-in or repository.
  - This suggests that the binding of how to install nmslib depends on the environment, and different methods are used for each. The matrix shows conditional behavior based on environment.

- **Justification**: Based on the analysis above, no tactic strongly matches because the text is about installation instructions across environments, not directly about architectural patterns like reducing coupling or increasing cohesion.",None,"The provided text describes a matrix for testing nmslib installation compatibility and offers setup instructions using Conda environments and specific pip commands with parameters.

**Resource Monitoring**: The text mentions collecting real-time data about resources (e.g., requesting a machine) and classifying devices. However, it does not describe any monitoring of resource usage during operation. Instead, it focuses on training performance metrics.

*   **Metering**: No mention of measuring energy consumption in real time or via sensors.
*   **Static Classification**: The text describes specifying the type of machine (e.g., `--machine-type n1-standard-16`) based on its characteristics. This could be seen as static classification, but it's more about selecting a hardware configuration than classifying existing resources for energy monitoring.
*   **Dynamic Classification**: No dynamic models or transient conditions are mentioned in the context of resource usage during training.

**No Match**

**Resource Allocation**: The text discusses allocating computational resources (specifically, requesting a GPU machine) to meet processing demands. This aligns with vertical scaling and brokering concepts.

*   *Vertical Scaling*: Yes, by specifying the `--machine-type n1-standard-16` which has 16 vCPUs and an accelerator, it's allocating more powerful resources (scaling up vertically). Also, there is a mention of removing/deactivating resources implicitly via machine termination policies.

*   *Horizontal Scaling*: No horizontal scaling mentioned. The focus is on one VM with specific resources rather than adding multiple machines or distributing tasks across many nodes.

*   *Scheduling*: There's no explicit scheduling logic described in the text for allocating tasks over time to different resources based on energy constraints.

*   *Brokering*: While not explicitly called brokering, selecting a machine with specific GPU capabilities (like `--accelerator=type=nvidia-tesla-p100`) can be interpreted as matching service requests (training deep learning models) with providers (Google Cloud machines) based on their energy characteristics. This is somewhat similar to brokering.

**Match for Vertical Scaling and Brokering**

**Resource Adaptation**: The text does not describe adapting services or improving efficiency of algorithms beyond the initial training setup. It focuses more on resource allocation than adaptation.

*   *Service Adaptation*: No mention of dynamically switching resources during operation based on energy efficiency.

*   *Increase Efficiency*: There's a focus on performance (accuracy) but no explicit improvement of algorithm time/memory for energy gain, or matching hardware to requests beyond the initial setup. The text does not describe such adaptation.

","The text discusses an API for handling CRAM files in bioinformatics, including the use of ref_path parameter for reading and writing. It mentions that htslib cannot handle external reference files from non-POSIX systems, leading to a recommendation to use embedded references instead.",The goal is to improve file access simplicity and safety by avoiding reliance on external reference files when working with CRAM files.,"Reduce Size of a Module: The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing the size of any module. It focuses on API usage and recommendations for handling data, so this tactic doesn't apply.
Increase Cohesion: This is about making modules more focused by moving unrelated responsibilities to different modules. The text talks about using embedded references instead of external ones due to complexity and safety issues, which could be seen as reducing coupling or improving encapsulation rather than directly increasing semantic coherence within a module.
Reduce Coupling: Several tactics under this category are relevant. Encapsulate involves defining an interface to limit dependencies. Use an Intermediary might help by introducing layers between modules. Restrict Dependencies is about controlling what other modules can access. Refactor and Abstract Common Services deal with reducing duplication or making services more general.

The text's recommendation to use embedded references (instead of external) likely reduces coupling because it avoids depending on the availability of an external file, thus decoupling the CRAM handling from the filesystem type.

Defer Binding: This involves binding values at different times. The text mentions that htslib cannot handle non-POSIX systems but recommends using embedded references for simplicity and safety. While this could be related to runtime vs compile-time decisions (like using resource files or configuration), it's not explicitly about deferring the binding of a value.

Defer Binding tactics include: Component Replacement, Compile-time Parameterization, Aspects, Configuration-time Binding, Resource Files, Startup Time Binding, Name Servers, Plug-ins, Publish-Subscribe. The text does mention that for CRAM files with external references, one must pass ref_path during construction (compile-time or configuration), but then recommends using embedded references which might be bound at a different time.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.

- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes a checkpoint manager that initializes to restore checkpoints if available, using configuration parameters like model_dir, model, optimizer, and strategy. It returns the state as a tf.train.Checkpoint object containing various components.","This text addresses system recovery by restoring previous states (checkpoints) in case of failures or interruptions, which aligns with fault tolerance mechanisms to prevent data loss or ensure continuity of operation.","Detect Faults: The text mentions checkpoint restoration but does not explicitly describe a mechanism for detecting faults. It focuses on prevention and recovery without detailing detection steps like heartbeat or monitor.
Match: No
Passive Redundancy: Not relevant as the description is about restoring state, not having redundant components in standby mode.
No Match: Yes
Active Redundancy: The checkpoint manager does not operate multiple identical nodes processing inputs in parallel. It's a single component managing state restoration.
No Match: Yes
Spare: No mention of cold sparing or redundant spares being activated during fail-over.
No Match: Yes
Exception Handling: Exception handling typically involves masking the fault, but here it's about restoring from checkpoints which is more preventive and recovery-oriented. However, checkpointing can be part of exception handling if a failure occurs.
Applicability: The text does not explicitly state that exceptions are being handled; instead, it focuses on initializing and potentially restoring state to continue operation without mentioning masking the fault or handling detected exceptions directly.
Match: No
Rollback: Rollback involves reverting to a previous known good state upon failure. Checkpoint restoration is similar but not exactly the same as rollback since it's about recovering from saved states rather than necessarily rolling back in time due to an exception.
Similarity: There might be overlap, but the text does not mention handling exceptions or masking them; it simply restores if a checkpoint exists.
Match: No
Retry: The text is about restoring state (checkpoint) and returning `tf.train.Checkpoint`, which implies recovery from previous state. Retry would involve attempting an operation again after failure without necessarily saving intermediate states.
Different Focus: Checkpointing saves the model, optimizer, etc., for potential restoration or continuation, whereas retry focuses on repeating a specific action that failed.
Match: No
Ignore Faulty Behavior: Not applicable as there's no mention of ignoring messages from faulty sources; instead, it's about restoring state to continue operation.
No Match: Yes
Degradation: The text does not indicate dropping less critical functions or maintaining only critical ones during failures. It focuses on restoring the entire state including model and optimizer.
No Match: Yes
Reconfiguration: Reconfiguration involves assigning responsibilities to other resources, but here it's about restoring a saved checkpoint which includes all components (model, optimizer, etc.). No mention of reassigning roles or changing topology.
No Match: Yes
Shadow: Not relevant as there is no shadow mode component operating in parallel and then reverting. The text describes a single checkpoint manager that restores if available.
No Match: Yes
State Resynchronization: This involves bringing failed components back to sync, but the text does not mention any failure or synchronization process; it's about initializing with a checkpoint if one exists.
No Match: Yes
Escalating Restart: No indication of varying restart granularity. The focus is on restoring from checkpoints without restarting components necessarily.
No Match: Yes
Non-Stop Forwarding: This splits control and data planes for continuous operation during recovery, but the text does not describe such a split or plane separation.
No Match: Yes
Removal from Service: Temporarily placing a component out of service. The checkpoint manager is described as initializing and potentially restoring state to continue operation; no mention of removing components from service.
No Match: Yes
Transactions: Ensures atomicity, consistency, etc., for distributed operations. The text does not describe any transaction mechanism or ACID properties in the context of distributed systems.
No Match: Yes
Predictive Model: Involves using models to predict future faults and take corrective action. No such predictive element is mentioned here; it's about restoring existing checkpoints.
No Match: Yes
Exception Prevention: Techniques to prevent exceptions from occurring. The text does not describe prevention but rather recovery by restoring state (checkpoint) which can be seen as a form of fault tolerance, though not explicitly preventive measures like avoiding certain conditions or states.
Applicability: Checkpointing is often used in conjunction with exception handling and prevention, but here it's presented as a mechanism to restore if available. The goal might be to prevent exceptions by having saved state, but the text does not specify that; it just says 'restores a checkpoint'.
Match: No
Increase Competence Set: Expanding operational states to handle more cases normally. Checkpointing allows recovery from failures without necessarily expanding competence sets beyond normal operation.
No Match: Yes",None,"The text describes initializing a checkpoint manager and restoring checkpoints if available, but it does not explicitly align with any of the provided architectural tactics for fault detection or recovery. The focus is on state management rather than specific fault handling mechanisms.",None,None

","The text describes a function called 'resolve_reference_variants' which processes overlapping candidate variants for genotype calls, distinguishing between those likely to be reference and non-reference. It explains the rationale behind separating these candidates due to computational complexity.","This text addresses the problem of handling overlapping variant calls in genome sequencing analysis by focusing on resolving incompatible haplotypes efficiently. The goal is to manage computational resources effectively, particularly avoiding exponential computation costs when dealing with too many candidate variants.","Resource Monitoring: No match.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Heartbeat: No periodic message exchange described.
Timestamp: No sequence event checking with timestamps.
Sanity Checking: The text does not indicate checks for operation validity or reasonableness.
Condition Monitoring: No condition tracking to prevent faulty behavior.
Voting: Not applicable; no multiple components voting on output.
Exception Detection: The initial failure is detected, but the text doesn't specify how it's detected. It describes handling the error after detection.

Passive Redundancy: No configuration described where spares handle traffic while active nodes monitor.
Spare: No cold sparing setup mentioned. The text doesn't indicate a spare component being activated.

Rollback: Not applicable; no mention of reverting to a previous state.
Software Upgrade: No upgrade process described for recovery.
Retry: The text says that successive Next() calls return the same error. This implies that retrying might not be effective, as it doesn't lead to success or progress. However, if we consider the possibility of retry in some contexts, but here it's noted as failing repeatedly.
Ignore Faulty Behavior: This is mentioned by returning the same error and preventing advancement, which could imply ignoring faulty messages from a source (though not explicitly stated). The text says that errors are returned consistently, so perhaps this tactic involves ignoring or masking these errors to prevent system progression.
Degradation: Not applicable; no mention of maintaining critical functions while dropping less critical ones. The system is stuck and cannot advance.
Reconfiguration: No reassigning responsibilities mentioned in the text.
Recover from Faults_Reintroduction: This tactic involves reintroducing a failed component back into service after repair or recovery. The text does not describe any such mechanism; it only mentions that errors are returned repeatedly, implying no recovery is happening through reintroduction.
Shadow: Not applicable; no shadow mode operation mentioned.
State Resynchronization: No mention of bringing components to consistent state before reuse.

Voting: Not applicable; no multiple components with identical inputs voting on output.
Exception Handling: The user uses a mechanism (--dry_run) to handle exceptions by masking faults before proceeding. This is related to Exception Detection and possibly Retry if restarting is considered.

The goal is likely to resolve build-time errors and ensure smooth integration of TensorFlow with the existing Python environment.","1. Reduce Size of a Module: This tactic involves splitting a module into smaller ones for better maintainability, but the text does not mention any need to split modules due to size or change cost reduction. The issue is about compatibility and installation errors, so this doesn't apply.

2. Increase Cohesion: This focuses on improving semantic coherence by moving unrelated responsibilities to different modules. However, the text describes a version mismatch (TensorFlow for Python 2.7 vs other packages for Python 3.5) rather than lack of cohesion or side effects from shared responsibilities. No match.

3. Reduce Coupling: The issue involves coupling between TensorFlow and other system components due to incompatible versions. This tactic includes encapsulation, intermediaries, restricting dependencies, etc., which could help decouple the modules by managing version-specific dependencies separately. However, the text does not explicitly describe any of these actions being taken or considered for this purpose.

4. Defer Binding: The issue is about binding TensorFlow to a specific Python interpreter (version) at build time causing problems because other packages are for a different version. This tactic involves delaying such bindings until runtime through various methods like plug-ins, dynamic lookup, etc., which could help avoid the mismatch by allowing flexible configuration or dependency injection later in the process.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

The goal appears to be creating a flexible and reusable structure that can handle different data types and formats without tightly coupling components.","Evaluating each tactic:

- **Reduce Size of a Module**: This text does not mention splitting any module into smaller ones or reducing the size of existing modules. It describes multiple classes but doesn't indicate they are too large to be split.

- **Increase Cohesion** (under `Increase Semantic Coherence`): The tactic involves moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules. In this text, we see a clear class hierarchy with one abstract base (`GenomicsReader`) and multiple subclasses for specific formats. However, there's no explicit mention of moving unrelated responsibilities or improving semantic coherence by grouping related ones.

- **Reduce Coupling** (under various tactics): The tactic `Encapsulate` introduces an interface to reduce changes propagating through dependencies. Here, the base class (`GenomicsReader`) defines an API that is subclassed for different implementations, which suggests encapsulation but without explicit interfaces mentioned beyond what's implied by inheritance and method definitions.

  Other relevant tactics from **Reduce Coupling**:
    - `Use an Intermediary`: Not directly addressed; the system uses a base class with subclasses rather than intermediaries.
    - `Restrict Dependencies`: No mention of restricting which modules interact or dependencies are limited.
    - `Refactor` (from `Increase Cohesion`): The text mentions moving responsibilities to different modules, but it's not clear if this is part of refactoring. However, the class hierarchy might be a form of refactorization for cohesion and coupling reduction.
    - `Abstract Common Services`: This seems applicable as there are common services provided by the base class (`GenomicsReader`) that are inherited by subclasses like `DispatchingGenomicsReader` and `TFRecordReader`. The abstract base defines methods (iterate, query) that can be used uniformly across different implementations. However, no explicit mention of creating an abstract service or reducing duplication through abstraction.

- **Defer Binding** (under various tactics): This tactic involves binding values at different times to reduce coupling and increase flexibility. In the text:
    - `GenomicsReaderSubClass` is used generically for both iteration and querying, but it's clear that subclasses handle specific formats.
    - The instantiation of readers depends on reader-specific requirements documented elsewhere (not in this text).
    - There are examples of binding at runtime: calling the iterate() method explicitly or using query().
    - However, no explicit mention of compile-time or configuration-time binding. The focus is more on how to use the classes rather than when bindings occur.

  Other tactics from **Defer Binding**:
    - `Component Replacement`: Not mentioned; bindings are not done via build scripts or replacements.
    - `Configuration-time Binding`: No explicit mention of deployment time configuration for binding values.
    - `Resource Files`, `Runtime Registration`, etc.: These aren't directly referenced in the text. The system relies on subclassing and method calls, but no runtime registration through name servers or shared repositories is described.",Reduce Overhead,"The selected tactic 'Reduce Overhead' does not appear to be strongly supported by the provided text as it focuses more on class hierarchy and API design rather than explicitly addressing overhead reduction.

",The text describes a function that resolves potentially sharded file specs into concrete paths for a single shard by using a master filespec to enforce consistency.,"This text addresses the need to handle sharding in a system, ensuring that all filespecs are consistent and valid based on the master. It suggests avoiding errors from inconsistent sharding configurations.","Reduce Size of a Module: The function appears to be focused on resolving paths for one shard at a time, which might reduce complexity by handling only one shard but doesn't necessarily split into multiple modules. No Match.
Increase Cohesion: This text emphasizes consistency and checking validity through the master filespec, which could improve cohesion by ensuring that related parts (filespecs) are coordinated properly. However, it's not explicitly about moving responsibilities to different modules. There might be a match for increasing semantic coherence but let's see if there's another tactic.
Reduce Coupling: The function uses encapsulation principles by having an explicit interface with the master filespec constraining others, which reduces coupling between shards and filespecs. Also, it enforces consistency through checks, reducing propagation of changes or errors. There are tactics like 'Encapsulate' (introducing an explicit interface) and 'Restrict Dependencies' that could apply here.

It mentions speeding up `call_variants` by more than 3x, making `make_examples` run faster (more than 3 times), improving accuracy through parameter tuning, and adding optimizations throughout the codebase.","[Reduce Size of a Module]: The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing average change cost. It focuses on performance improvements without discussing module size reduction.

[Increase Cohesion]: There is no discussion about moving responsibilities to different modules or reducing side effects, so this tactic doesn't apply.

[Reduce Coupling]: This section includes several tactics:
  - [Encapsulate]: The text mentions using an explicit interface (TensorFlow with Intel MKL support) but does not explicitly state it as encapsulation. However, the performance improvements might imply better encapsulation indirectly without direct mention.
  - [Use an Intermediary]: No intermediary is mentioned for breaking dependencies.
  - [Restrict Dependencies]: The text doesn't discuss restricting module interactions.
  - [Refactor]: While there are optimizations and changes (e.g., new realigner implementation, changed window selector), these don't explicitly match refactoring to reduce duplication. Refactoring typically refers to restructuring code without changing behavior, but the text describes performance gains which might involve more than just refactor.
  - [Abstract Common Services]: No mention of abstracting common services or reducing modification costs through abstraction.

[Defer Binding]: This section includes multiple tactics:
  - [Component Replacement]: The TensorFlow version update is a change in build scripts, but it's not specified as compile-time binding. It might be considered if the default build script changes are part of compilation.
  - [Compile-time Parameterization]: Not mentioned; no parameterization at compile time for performance bindings.
  - [Aspects]: No aspect-based approach is described.
  - [Configuration-time Binding]: The flag `-ws_use_window_selector_model` suggests a configuration change, but it's unclear if the binding happens during deployment or startup. It might be considered as configuration-time binding if set before runtime.
  - [Resource Files]: Not mentioned; no resource files used for binding values at startup.
  - [Startup Time Binding]: The text doesn't specify binding at startup time.
  - [Name Servers]: No name servers involved in performance bindings.
  * [Runtime Registration]: The new training case study might involve registration, but not explicitly described.
  - [Dynamic Lookup]: Not mentioned; no dynamic lookup for services during runtime.
  - [Interpret Parameters]: The flag system could be seen as interpreting parameters at runtime, but it's more about configuration than parameter interpretation.
  - [Plug-ins]: No plug-in mechanism is discussed in the context of performance bindings.
  - [Publish-Subscribe]: Not relevant to this text; no messaging patterns mentioned.
  - [Shared Repositories]: The Cloud TPUs might be considered a shared repository, but it's not explicitly tied to binding values at runtime. It's more about deployment infrastructure.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""e lists into groups that respect the requirements of the max_group_size and max_separation arguments. This is necessary because the labeling algorithm is very expensive as a function of the number of input variants, so to avoid excessive runtime we break up our potentially large list of candidate and truth variants into smaller groups (max number controlled by max_group_size) based on a maximum distance allowed between the closest variants within the group. The current algorithm is a simple greedy one; we effectively merge the two variant lists together, make groups greedily on that list until either the maximum number of elements of a specific type (i.e., max_group_size of 2 implies we can have up to two candidate variants or truth variants within a group) or we encounter a variant further away from the closest variant within the current group than allowed by max_separation. Args: candidates: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of candidate variants on the same chromosome. truths: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of truth variants on the same chromosome. max_group_size: int >= 0. The maximum number of variants of a specific type allowed within a group. max_separation: int >= 0. The maximum distance, in basepairs, allowed between the closest variants within a group. max_gt_options_product: int >= 0. The maximum number of combinations of genotypes (product of all genotypes in the group). force_group_within_bp: int >= 0. Variants within this many bps will be forced to be put in the same group. This is to ensure that we do not decouple candidates and truths in variant-dense regions. This value can be set to -1 for unit-test purposes. Setting -1 will not force any grouping of variants. Returns: A list of grouped variants in 2-tuples, such as: [(candidates1, truth_variants1), ...] where each tuple contains the candidate and truth variants for that group. Raises: ValueError: if any of the inputs are malformed.""
","The text describes a method to break up lists of variants into groups based on specific arguments (max_group_size, max_separation) to reduce the runtime cost of an expensive labeling algorithm by processing smaller groups.",The goal is to optimize performance and resource usage by reducing the computational burden of an algorithm that processes large datasets. This involves breaking down a monolithic operation into manageable chunks (groups).,"Reduce Size of a Module: The text does not explicitly mention splitting modules, but it describes grouping data which can be seen as modularizing the input for processing purposes. However, this is more about partitioning data than creating separate modules in code structure.
Increase Cohesion: This tactic focuses on making modules more focused and reducing side effects by moving unrelated responsibilities. The text does not discuss cohesion or moving responsibilities between modules; it's about grouping variants based on distance and size constraints for efficiency.
Reduce Coupling: Several tactics under this category are evaluated:
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction is mentioned in the text.
- Use an Intermediary: Not applicable, no intermediary is introduced to break dependencies.
- Restrict Dependencies: The algorithm ensures that variants within a certain distance are grouped together (force_group_within_bp) which might imply some coupling restriction but it's more about grouping constraints than dependency management.
- Refactor: This involves removing duplication by assigning common responsibilities. The text does not mention any duplication or refactoring to remove code duplication.
- Abstract Common Services: No indication of abstracting services in a general form is present in the text.",Defer binding,"The selected tactic 'Defer Binding' aligns with the description because the algorithm groups variants at runtime based on dynamic constraints (max_group_size and max_separation) rather than fixed compile-time or build-time bindings, thus deferring the grouping decision until execution.",Breaking up lists into smaller groups to reduce computational cost by processing fewer elements at once.,Reduction in runtime due to handling smaller subsets of data.

",The text discusses a user's inquiry about Scisp,The goal is to understand and potentially improve the resource management for abbreviation disambiguation within the Scispacy system.,"I need to evaluate each tactic against this text. Let me go through them one by one: First, 'Reduce Size of a Module' - Splitting modules isn't mentioned here. The user is asking about resources used in an existing component (AbbreviationDetector), not changing its size or splitting it. So no match for that category.

Now, 'Increase Cohesion': There's mention of moving responsibilities to different modules if they don't serve the same purpose. But the text doesn't talk about refactoring or improving semantic coherence directly. It's more about understanding existing resources and their comprehensiveness. No direct indication of this tactic being applied or considered.

'Reduce Coupling' has several sub-tactics: Encapsulate, Use an Intermediary, Restrict Dependencies, Refactor, Abstract Common Services. The text doesn't mention anything about interfaces, dependencies between modules, or reducing propagation risks. It's purely informational inquiry. No match here.

'Defer Binding': This involves binding values at different times (compile-time, runtime). The user is asking if there's a specific dictionary/database used for mapping abbreviations, and whether it can be reviewed/exported. They're inquiring about the resource being bound at build time or startup time? But they don't explicitly state that Scispacy uses such binding techniques to reduce coupling or improve flexibility. It's more of an external question.

Looking closer: The user wants details on how resources are used, including if it's available for review/export. This could be related to 'Resource Files' under Defer Binding? But the text doesn't say that Scispacy uses resource files for binding at runtime or build time. It just asks about them.

Also, 'Configuration-time Binding', but again no mention of configuration being used as a binding mechanism here.

The user is asking if the disambiguation resource exists and can be exported/reviewed. This might relate to how the system manages resources (like visibility or encapsulation) under 'Reduce Coupling' > 'Restrict Dependencies'. But it's not clear from the text that Scispacy uses these tactics; rather, they're asking about them.

I think I need to stick with evaluating based on what is directly stated. The text doesn't describe any tactical changes being made or considered in terms of software architecture patterns like encapsulation or deferred binding. It's a question seeking information.",None,"The user's inquiry does not describe any specific architectural change or tactic application; it is purely asking for details about existing resources and their usage within the system, without mentioning modifications to structure or behavior based on software architecture principles.",None,None

The primary architectural goals are likely improving system efficiency by reducing execution time and increasing correctness through better algorithms.","[Evaluate each tactic]:
1. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - Metering: No mention of collecting real-time energy data.
   - Static Classification: Not discussed; no benchmarking or static characterization based on device properties.
   - Dynamic Classification: No dynamic models for energy determination mentioned.
   Match: No
2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Vertical Scaling: No explicit scaling up/down of individual resources (like CPU, RAM).
   - Horizontal Scaling: Not described as adding/removing servers or VMs from a pool.
   - Scheduling: The text mentions multi-processing which could relate to task allocation but does not detail scheduling for energy optimization. It focuses on time reduction without specifying resource usage metrics.
   Match: No
3. **Resource Adaptation**:
   - Service Adaptation: Not mentioned; no switching resources based on efficiency or cost.
   - Increase Efficiency: The text describes improvements in accuracy and processing time, which could imply increased algorithmic efficiency (e.g., training DeepTrio specifically for de novo). However, it does not explicitly state matching hardware to requests or improving critical algorithms' performance. It mentions migration from Slim to Keras, which is a tool change but might improve efficiency.
   - Reduce Overhead: The multi-processing addition and platform migration could reduce overhead by co-locating resources (e.g., using multiple processors) and removing intermediaries (like the Slim framework). This tactic involves reducing computational overhead for energy savings. The text shows reduced execution time, which is a sign of lower overhead.

These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

1. Reduce Size of a Module - Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules or reducing their size, so No Match.
2. Increase Cohesion - Increase Semantic Coherence: There is no explicit discussion about moving responsibilities to different modules to reduce side effects; the changes are more operational and configuration-related, so No Match.
3. Reduce Coupling - Encapsulate: The text does not describe introducing an interface to decouple a module, so No Match.
4. Reduce Coupling - Use an Intermediary: Not mentioned in the text, so No Match.
5. Reduce Coupling - Restrict Dependencies: The update of TensorFlow dependency (version 1.11) might imply restricting or managing dependencies, but it's not explicitly stated as a coupling reduction tactic, and there are no other changes about restricting module interactions, so No Match.
6. Reduce Coupling - Refactor: There is mention of adding support for Ubuntu 18.04 and updating TensorFlow dependency, which could be seen as refactoring to adapt the system, but it's not clear that common responsibilities were factored out; these are more about fixing specific issues or adapting dependencies, so No Match.

- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction

","The text describes a new feature for automatic acquisition of hyponyms from large text corpora using SpaCy Matcher. It explains that passing `extended=True` increases recall but decreases precision, and it produces a doc attribute with extracted hyponym pairs. Additionally, there are bug fixes related to entity linkers reducing UMLS linker size by ~10%.","The text focuses on adding functionality (new feature for hyponym detection) while also addressing issues in existing code (bug fixes). The primary goal seems to be extending the system's capabilities with a new component and improving its efficiency through bug fixes, specifically mentioning recall/precision trade-off and reduction of data size.","For 'Separate the User Interface': This tactic is about isolating UI responsibilities. The text does not discuss user interface components or their separation; it talks about NLP functionality and bug fixes in entity linkers. No Match.

For 'Support User Initiative': This involves allowing users to control operations (e.g., cancel, undo). The text mentions a feature that allows extended patterns for higher recall but lower precision, which is more about system capability than user control. It also includes an example of how the component works and bug fixes not directly related to user interaction. No Match.

For 'Support System Initiative': This tactic involves maintaining task/user/system models to provide assistance or feedback. The text describes a new feature for hyponym detection, which is part of system functionality (task model maintenance). It also mentions an improvement in dependency parsing and bug fixes that enhance the system's performance and accuracy. There might be some alignment with 'Maintain task models' as it adds a component to detect hyponyms based on patterns, but the text does not explicitly state context determination or assistance provision. However, the bug fix about reducing duplicated aliases could relate to data model maintenance implicitly.

- **Reduce Coupling**: This tactic involves reducing dependencies between modules. In this text, there's mention of removing `nmslib` dependency by switching to `annoy`, which can be seen as part of encapsulation or restricting dependencies (Rule 6). However, the primary change is within one file (`scispacy/candidate_generation.py`) and not necessarily reducing coupling between multiple modules. The text does talk about making changes without too much overhead, but that's more about code complexity than coupling reduction.

- **Defer Binding**: This tactic involves binding values at different times (compile-time, runtime). In the text, there is no explicit mention of changing how bindings are done or using any mechanism to defer them. The switch from `nmslib` to `annoy` might be considered a form of dependency change, but it doesn't specify if binding was deferred in any particular way.",Reduce Overhead,The text discusses the potential for reducing overhead by switching libraries and keeping code changes minimal.,None,None

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

The goal is to resolve this issue, likely to ensure compatibility across different hardware platforms and prevent build failures on systems without support for these instructions.","Detect Faults: The error message indicates a fault condition (missing file or directory). However, the text does not describe any mechanism for detecting faults in general system behavior. It focuses on diagnosing an existing fault rather than implementing detection tactics like Ping/Echo or Heartbeat.
Monitor: No mention of monitoring components or their health is present in the text.
Heartbeat: The error is about compilation failure due to missing header, not related to periodic message exchange for fault detection.
Timestamp: Not relevant as there's no discussion about event sequencing or time-based checks.
Sanity Checking: There might be an implicit assumption that checking compiler flags could prevent errors, but the text does not explicitly describe such a tactic being used.
Condition Monitoring: The error is tied to specific conditions (CPU instruction set support), but again, no monitoring mechanism is described in the context of preventing or detecting faults via condition checks.
Voting: Not applicable as there's no redundancy or multiple components voting on an output. This text is about a single installation process failure.
Exception Detection: The error message indicates that an exception (compilation failure) occurred due to missing dependencies, but the user has not implemented any detection mechanism for such exceptions in their system architecture description.
Self-Test: Not mentioned; the issue is external to the code being compiled. 
Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: The text does not describe recovery mechanisms like Active Redundancy or Passive Redundancy, which are about handling failures through redundancy. It's focused on a single installation attempt.
Removal from Service: This tactic involves taking a component out of service to prevent failure. In the context provided, it might be related if they were removing an incompatible library, but the text is describing how to change settings and flags to avoid the error during compilation itself, not necessarily preventing a running service fault.
Transactions: Not relevant as there's no discussion about atomicity or consistency in message exchanges between distributed components. The issue is local to one machine's build process.
Predictive Model: No indication of using models to predict future faults based on monitoring data.
Exception Prevention: This seems highly applicable. The user is trying to prevent the fault by modifying compiler flags and environment variables (export DV_USE_GCP_OPTIMIZED_TF_WHL=0, changing DV_COPT_FLAGS) to avoid the incompatible instructions during compilation.

This can be controlled by a flag. `-ws_use_window_selector_model` which is now on by default. . * Many micro-optimizations throughout the codebase. * Added a new [training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.7/docs/deepvariant-tpu-training-case-study.md) showing how to train and fine-tune DeepVariant models. * Added [support for CRAM files](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.7/docs/deepvariant-details.md#cram-support)""

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.

","The user describes a problem with extracting disease and treatment entities from medical sentences using the SciSpacy library. They initially used a specialized NER model (en_ner_bc5cdr_md) which missed some entities but provided good results for diseases. Then they switched to en_core_sci_lg, which extracts all medical-related entities but does not classify them into categories like disease or treatment. To address this, they integrated UMLS and extracted type codes from the UMLS Semantic Type Tree to classify entities, but encountered false positives and missed some entities.","The user is trying to improve entity extraction accuracy by using a more comprehensive model (en_core_sci_lg) with UMLS integration for classification. However, they are facing issues of false positives and missing entities due to the lack of proper filtering or categorization mechanisms.","1.
