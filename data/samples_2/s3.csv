","The text describes a compatibility matrix for installing nmslib in various environments and Python versions, along with multiple installation methods including pip, conda, virtual environments, and direct Git cloning.",The core problem is the lack of universal support across all environments and Python versions during the standard `pip install` process. The goal was to provide a flexible way for users to handle different scenarios by suggesting alternative installation methods based on their specific conditions.,"For each tactic, I will analyze if it directly addresses the architectural trigger:

- Split Module: This is about reducing module size and improving maintainability, but there's no mention of splitting code. No Match.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: The text doesn't discuss grouping related functionalities or removing unrelated ones to improve coherence. No Match.
- Encapsulate: There's an introduction of interfaces (like Mamba environment) that might reduce propagation, but it's not explicit in the matrix itself. Indirectly addresses by using intermediaries like virtual environments, so I'll say No Match for direct application.
- Use an Intermediary: This tactic involves breaking dependencies with an intermediary. The text uses tools like Mamba and Git to handle different installations, which acts as an intermediary between the user's environment and the installation process. However, it doesn't specify a clear intermediary module; instead, it suggests various methods. Partially addresses by providing alternatives but not directly through encapsulation or explicit interfaces. No Match.
- Restrict Dependencies: The matrix restricts dependencies based on environment (e.g., specific flags for Windows Subsystem for Linux). This tactic is about limiting interactions to reduce coupling and propagation of changes, which aligns with the trigger's need to handle different environments without changing core logic. However, it's more about conditional compilation or runtime adjustments rather than restricting at compile time. Still, it does address reducing modification costs by providing tailored solutions. Match.
- Refactor: The text doesn't mention factoring out common services; instead, it lists various installation methods which might involve refactoring but not directly addressed in the matrix description. No Match.
- Abstract Common Services: This is about creating a general form for similar services to reduce modification costs. The matrix abstracts different installation scenarios under one tool (pip) with conditional parameters, so it could be seen as an application of this tactic by having a unified interface but varying implementations based on environment. However, the core issue isn't duplication in code but rather lack of compatibility across environments. No Match.
- Component Replacement: This involves binding values at build time through replacement. The text doesn't use scripts or tools to replace components; it's more about suggesting methods that might work for specific cases. Not a strong match.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Binding at compile time, but the matrix uses runtime and deployment-time bindings (like Git install). No Match.
- Aspects: Aspect-oriented programming is not mentioned in the text. The tactics described are about installation and environment handling, not cross-cutting concerns. No Match.
- Configuration-time Binding: This involves binding values at deployment time through configuration files or scripts. The matrix uses methods like `CFLAGS` for some installations (which might be set during build) but also suggests using Git or Mamba which aren't necessarily configurations. However, the use of environment-specific flags and instructions can be seen as a form of configuration-time binding. This is closer to the trigger's need to handle different environments without changing core logic by providing configurable ways to install. Match.
- Resource Files: Not mentioned in the text; it's about installation methods, not resource files for data or configurations. No Match.
- Runtime Registration: The matrix suggests installing via pip with specific flags at runtime (e.g., `CFLAGS`), but these are more like compile-time adjustments than pure runtime registration. However, some installations might be done dynamically during runtime if the environment is detected. Not a direct match.
- Dynamic Lookup: This involves finding services at runtime without predefined bindings. The text doesn't mention any service discovery mechanism; it's about static installation methods with specific commands. No Match.
- Interpret Parameters: Binding values by interpreting parameters at runtime, which could be part of the matrix if we consider that `CFLAGS` or other flags are interpreted during setup. But these are more like compile-time adjustments than pure parameter interpretation for binding. Still, it's a form of conditional execution based on input. Match.
- Startup Time Binding: This is about setting up bindings at startup time. The text mentions activating environments and then installing via pip, which might be done at startup if the environment isn't set initially. But not explicitly tied to startup for binding values. No strong match.
- Name Servers: Not relevant; no mention of network or service discovery using name servers. No Match.
- Plug-ins: The text doesn't discuss loading external modules as plug-ins during runtime. It's about installation and environment setup, so this tactic isn't applied here. No Match.
- Publish-Subscribe: This is a messaging pattern for decoupling components; not relevant to the installation matrix described in the text. No Match.
- Shared Repositories: Not mentioned; it's about installing from specific sources or repositories conditionally (e.g., via Git), but that doesn't necessarily involve sharing across multiple modules. The trigger isn't about data sharing, so this is a mismatch. No Match.

Based on the above analysis, I have identified tactics that match the architectural_trigger: Restrict Dependencies and Configuration-time Binding.",Configuration-time Binding,"The selected tactic of Configuration-time Binding directly addresses the architectural trigger by allowing users to bind installation values at deployment time (when setting up their environment) through specific configuration methods like using `CFLAGS` or selecting different Python versions, which aligns with the text's goal of providing flexible ways for users to handle compatibility issues without changing core logic."

""Classes that provide the interface for reading genomics data. `GenomicsReader` defines the core API supported by readers, and is subclassed directly or indirectly (via `DispatchingGenomicsReader`) for all concrete implementations. `TFRecordReader` is an implementation of the `GenomicsReader` API for reading `TFRecord` files. This is usable for all data types when encoding data in protocol buffers. `DispatchingGenomicsReader` is an abstract class defined for convenience on top of `GenomicsReader` that supports reading from either the native file format or from `TFRecord` files of the corresponding protocol buffer used to encode data of that file type. The input format assumed is dependent upon the filename of the input data. Concrete implementations for individual file types (e.g. BED, SAM, VCF, etc.) reside in type-specific modules in this package. The instantiation of readers may have reader-specific requirements documented there. General examples of the `iterate()` and `query()` functionality are shown below. ```python Equivalent ways to iterate through all elements in a reader. 1. Using the reader itself as an iterable object. kwargs = ... Reader-specific keyword arguments. with GenomicsReaderSubClass(output_path, **kwargs) as reader: for proto in reader: do_something(reader.header, proto) 2.

- Split Module: No match. The text does not describe splitting a module into smaller ones.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No match. There is no mention of moving unrelated responsibilities to different modules.
- Encapsulate: Match. By defining an explicit interface (`GenomicsReader`) and having subclasses implement it, the system reduces dependencies between implementations and the core logic.
- Use an Intermediary: Match. The `DispatchingGenomicsReader` acts as an intermediary that depends on the specific reader implementation chosen at runtime or configuration time.
- Restrict Dependencies: No match. There is no explicit restriction of module interactions mentioned.
- Refactor: No match. While there might be common services, they are not factored out into separate modules for reduction purposes.
- Abstract Common Services: Match.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""After initially encountering a failure, successive Next() calls will continue to return the same error--we cannot advance further.""
","The text describes that after an initial system failure, subsequent operations (Next() calls) will repeatedly return the same error and prevent any further progress.",The core problem is handling persistent errors from a failed component to avoid blocking other operations or services.,"Ping/Echo: No match. The text does not mention exchanging request/response messages for reachability checks.
Monitor: No match. There's no indication of a separate monitoring component checking system health.
Heartbeat: No match. Periodic message exchange is not described in the context of fault detection.
Timestamp: No match. Using local clocks to detect event sequence issues isn't referenced.
Sanity Checking: No match. The text doesn't involve validating operations or outputs for reasonableness.
Condition Monitoring: No match. There's no monitoring conditions to prevent faulty behavior mentioned.
Voting: No match. Multiple components processing identical inputs with voting logic aren't described.
Exception Detection: No match. Detecting altered system flow isn't the focus here; it's about handling detected errors.
Self-Test: No match. Components running self-testing procedures are not referenced in this text.
Active Redundancy: No match. The concept of parallel processing with identical inputs is absent from the description.
Passive Redund (Redundancy): No match. Periodic state updates for redundancy aren't mentioned or implied.
Spare: No match. Cold sparing where spares are activated on failure isn't described in this text.
Exception Handling: Match. The text describes handling a detected error by continuing to return it, which aligns with masking the fault using exception handling mechanisms.
Rollback: No match. Reverting to a previous state is not mentioned or implied.
Software Upgrade: No match. Upgrading code without affecting service isn't referenced here.
Retry: No match. The text indicates that retries (successive Next() calls) do not lead to success but continue with the same error, so it doesn't align with retrying until recovery.
Ignore Faulty Behavior: Match. Although not explicitly stated as ignoring spurious messages, this tactic involves handling faulty behavior by ignoring it from a particular source. The text implies that after initial failure, further calls ignore or are unaffected by the failed state (by returning same error), which could be interpreted as ignoring faulty behavior.
Degradation: No match. Dropping less critical functions isn't mentioned; instead, progress is blocked entirely.
Reconfiguration: No match. Reassigning responsibilities to functional resources isn't described in this text.
Shadow: No match. Operating a failed component in shadow mode for recovery isn't referenced here.
State Resynchronization: No match. Bringing failed components back to consistent state with active ones isn't mentioned or implied.
Escalating Restart: No match. Varying restart granularity is not described; the system seems stuck on error.
Non-Stop Forwarding: No match. Splitting control and data planes for continuous operation during recovery isn't referenced in this text.
Transactions: No match. Ensuring atomicity, consistency, etc., of asynchronous messages isn't relevant to this scenario.
Predictive Model: No match. Using models with monitors to predict faults is not mentioned or implied.
Exception Prevention: No Match. The text describes an error that has occurred and needs handling, so prevention tactics are not applicable here.
Increase Competence Set: No match. Expanding operational states isn't referenced in this context.",Ignore Faulty Behavior,"The selected tactic 'Ignore Faulty Behavior' directly addresses the architectural trigger by ignoring subsequent erroneous messages from a failed component, thereby preventing the system from being blocked and allowing it to continue operating with the same error state."
55,integrability,"i SciSpacy Team,. First I want to thank the team for this wonderful library. Given a sentence, I am trying to extract **""Disease""** & **""Treatment""** related entities from the sentence. **Eg:** Patient is suffering from cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. **Output Expected** : **Disease :** cancer , **Treatment :** chemotherapy . So Initially I started with specialized NER ( **en_ner_bc5cdr_md**) just to extract the disease-related entities. It was giving good results but not giving all the disease-related entities. **Eg:** patient was not able to attend work due to influenza. For the above example, it's not returning **influenza**. Like this, there are many examples like flu and many others. As a next step, I moved to **en_core_sci_lg** which is actually giving all the medical-related entities from the text.

## Text To Analyze:
""i SciSpacy Team,. First I want to thank the team for this wonderful library. Given a sentence, I am trying to extract **""Disease""** & **""Treatment""** related entities from the sentence. **Eg:** Patient is suffering from cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. **Output Expected** : **Disease :** cancer , **Treatment :** chemotherapy . So Initially I started with specialized NER ( **en_ner_bc5cdr_md**) just to extract the disease-related entities. It was giving good results but not giving all the disease-related entities. **Eg:** patient was not able to attend work due to influenza. For the above example, it's not returning **influenza**. Like this, there are many examples like flu and many others. As a next step, I moved to **en_core_sci_lg** which is actually giving all the medical-related entities from the text. But, the problem was, it doesn't classify the entity into categories ( like disease, treatment). When I explored further, I understood that I can take the help of UMLS integration, where for each entity returned by the en_core_sci_lg, we can extract the umls_ent using entity._.umls_ents and then get it's **concept name, concept id, type** and even threshold score. Here I am using **type**, and by using **type codes** from **UMLS_Semantic_Type_Tree**, I am trying to classify the entity into either Disease or treatment. Problem is, I'm getting false positives by using this approach and also sometimes I am missing the entities too.

26,modifiability,"The v1.1 release introduces DeepTrio, which uses a model specifically trained to call a mother-father-child trio or parent-child duo. DeepTrio has superior accuracy compared to DeepVariant. Pre-trained models are available for Illumina WGS, Illumina exome, and PacBio HiFi. In addition, DeepVariant v1.1 contains the following improvements:. * Accuracy improvements on PacBio, reducing Indel errors by ~21% on the case study. This is achieved by adding an input channel which specifically encodes haplotype information, as opposed to only sorting by haplotype in v1.0. The flag is `--add_hp_channel` which is enabled by default for PacBio. * Speed improvements for long read data by more efficient handling of long CIGAR strings. . * New functionality to add detailed logs for runtime of make_examples by genomic region, viewable in an interactive visualization. * We now fully withhold HG003 from all training, and report all accuracy evaluations on HG003. We continue to withhold chromosome20 from training in all samples. New optional flags to increase speed:. A team at Intel has adapted DeepVariant to use the OpenVINO toolkit, which further accelerates . TensorFlow applications. This further speeds up the call_variants stage by ~25% for any model when run in CPU mode on an Intel machine. DeepVariant runs of OpenVINO have the same accuracy and are nearly identical to runs without. Runs with OpenVINO are fully reproducible on OpenVINO. To use OpenVINO, add the following flag too the DeepVariant command:. `--call_variants_extra_args use_openvino=true""`. We thank Intel for their contribution, and acknowledge the extensive work their team put in, captured in (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/pull/363)","

""The v1.1 release introduces DeepTrio, which uses a model specifically trained to call a mother-father-child trio or parent-child duo. DeepTrio has superior accuracy compared to DeepVariant. Pre-trained models are available for Illumina WGS, Illumina exome, and PacBio HiFi. In addition, DeepVariant v1.1 contains the following improvements:. * Accuracy improvements on PacBio, reducing Indel errors by ~21% on the case study. This is achieved by adding an input channel which specifically encodes haplotype information, as opposed to only sorting by haplotype in v1.0. The flag is `--add_hp_channel` which is enabled by default for PacBio. * Speed improvements for long read data by more efficient handling of long CIGAR strings. . * New functionality to add detailed logs for runtime of make_examples by genomic region, viewable in an interactive visualization. * We now fully withhold HG003 from all training, and report all accuracy evaluations on HG003. We continue to withhold chromosome20 from training in all samples. New optional flags to increase speed:. A team at Intel has adapted DeepVariant to use the OpenVINO toolkit, which further accelerates . TensorFlow applications. This further speeds up the call_variants stage by ~25% for any model when run in CPU mode on an Intel machine. DeepVariant runs of OpenVINO have the same accuracy and are nearly identical to runs without. Runs with OpenVINO are fully reproducible on OpenVINO. To use OpenVINO, add the following flag too the DeepVariant command:. `--call_variants_extra_args use_openvino=true""`. We thank Intel for their contribution, and acknowledge the extensive work their team put in, captured in (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/pull/363)""

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

15,integrability,"This release includes numerous performance improvements that collectively reduce the runtime of DeepVariant by about 65%. .

","The text describes a function or algorithm that groups variant lists to reduce runtime costs by breaking large datasets into smaller groups based on configurable parameters like max_group_size, max_separation, etc., ensuring efficient processing without decoupling in dense regions.",The core problem is the high computational cost of a labeling algorithm when dealing with large input variant lists. The goal is to reduce runtime by grouping variants into smaller sets that respect specific constraints (max_group_size and max_separation).,"For each tactic, analyze if it addresses the trigger:

- Split Module: This tactic involves dividing a module into smaller ones. In this text, there's no mention of splitting modules or changing how code is organized across multiple files/modules.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: The focus here would be on improving internal consistency and reducing side effects by moving unrelated responsibilities to different modules. However, the text doesn't discuss restructuring for better coherence but rather grouping data based on parameters.
- Encapsulate: This tactic introduces an interface to hide implementation details and restrict dependencies. While there are arguments (parameters) that control behavior, no explicit interface is mentioned in this context.
- Use an Intermediary: An intermediary would act as a go-between for two parts of the system with a direct dependency. The text describes grouping variants based on parameters but doesn't introduce such a component.
- Restrict Dependencies: This involves limiting which modules can interact, often through interfaces or access control. In this case, dependencies are being managed by the algorithm's constraints (max_group_size and max_separation), but it's more about runtime binding than restricting module interactions.
- Refactor: This tactic factors out common responsibilities to reduce duplication. The text doesn't mention refactoring existing code for better structure or reducing duplication; instead, it talks about grouping data based on parameters.
- Abstract Common Services: Similar to refactor, this involves creating a general form of services that can be reused. No such abstraction is described in the text.
- Component Replacement: This binds values at compile time by replacing components. The algorithm doesn't split into multiple modules for replacement; it's about grouping data during runtime or initialization.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Binds values at build time, but here parameters are provided at runtime (max_group_size, max_separation) and used to control the grouping process.
- Aspects**: Aspect-oriented programming is not mentioned in this text. The algorithm doesn't use aspects for cross-cutting concerns or compile-time binding.
- Configuration-time Binding: Binds values during deployment via configuration files. In this case, parameters are passed at runtime (as arguments) and used to control the grouping process.
- Resource Files**: Not applicable; no resource files are mentioned in the context of binding values.
- Runtime Registration**: This binds values by registering them at runtime. The text describes a function that uses parameters to group variants during its execution, which is similar but not exactly matching as registration implies explicit calls or registrations for services.
- Dynamic Lookup**: Binds values through dynamic service lookup at runtime. Not directly relevant here; the algorithm doesn't use external services via dynamic lookup.
- Interpret Parameters: This tactic involves binding values by interpreting parameters at runtime. The text uses arguments (parameters) to control grouping behavior, which aligns with this tactic's definition of using parameter interpretation for binding.
- Startup Time Binding**: Binds values during startup time. While the algorithm might be initialized or run on startup, it doesn't specify any binding happening only then; parameters are used throughout execution.
- Name Servers: Not applicable; no name servers are mentioned in this text.
- Plug-ins: Involves loading functionality at runtime via plug-in mechanisms. The grouping is done by the algorithm itself based on input arguments and constraints, not through external plug-ins.
- Publish-Subscribe: A pattern for decoupling components via messaging. Not relevant here; no such messaging or event-driven binding is described.
- Shared Repositories**: Binds values through shared data stores at runtime. The text doesn't mention any shared repositories being used to bind the variant lists.
- Polymorphism: This allows different implementations based on type, enabling runtime binding without changing interfaces. While grouping might involve some form of polymorphic behavior (e.g., handling different types), it's not explicitly mentioned as a key mechanism here.",Runtime Registration,"The selected tactic is Runtime Registration because the algorithm binds values at runtime by interpreting parameters to control grouping, directly addressing the need to manage large datasets efficiently without excessive computational cost."

- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

27,energy efficiency,"d so far I think ScispaCy is an awesome tool to be able to identify and link biomedical entities found in text with concepts from UMLS and other knowledge bases. I was thinking it would be even more powerful if the entities identified by different models and by the AbbreviationDetector can be combined. This would allow the shortcomings of one model to be compensated by another model. It would also allow a model's shortcomings to be compensated by the long forms of any detected abbreviations. For example, the identified entities in Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) using the `en_core_sci_lg` model in the [ScispaCy Demo](url) are: . - Spinal"". - bulbar muscular atrophy"". - SBMA"". However, after adding the AbbreviationDetector as a pipe, we would recognize SBMA as an abbreviation for Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy"", so really, the entities should be the following, but they are not corrected as such:. - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy"". - SBMA"". Similarly, some models may identify fragments of a phrase as separate entities while another model may recognize a whole phrase as one entity. Or, some models may recognize certain entities while other models may completely ignore them. If there is some way of consolidating entities found by different models, then a more accurate and complete list of entities will be obtained than just using any given model individually.

## Text To Analyze:
""d so far I think ScispaCy is an awesome tool to be able to identify and link biomedical entities found in text with concepts from UMLS and other knowledge bases. I was thinking it would be even more powerful if the entities identified by different models and by the AbbreviationDetector can be combined. This would allow the shortcomings of one model to be compensated by another model. It would also allow a model's shortcomings to be compensated by the long forms of any detected abbreviations. For example, the identified entities in Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) using the `en_core_sci_lg` model in the [ScispaCy Demo](url) are: . - Spinal"". - bulbar muscular atrophy"". - SBMA"". However, after adding the AbbreviationDetector as a pipe, we would recognize SBMA as an abbreviation for Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy"", so really, the entities should be the following, but they are not corrected as such:. - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy"". - SBMA"". Similarly, some models may identify fragments of a phrase as separate entities while another model may recognize a whole phrase as one entity. Or, some models may recognize certain entities while other models may completely ignore them. If there is some way of consolidating entities found by different models, then a more accurate and complete list of entities will be obtained than just using any given model individually. There are also times when a longer phrased entity is not always better, because it may yield poor matching results that are below the desired mention threshold for a given knowledge base.

- Increase Semantic Coherence: No Match - There is no discussion about moving responsibilities between modules to improve coherence.
- Encapsulate: No Match - Although a virtual environment might act as an encapsulation, the tactic definition requires explicit interfaces which isn't mentioned here.
- Use an Intermediary: No Match - The text does not describe using an intermediary module or service.
- Restrict Dependencies: No Match - While there are multiple installation methods for dependencies (like nmslib), the trigger is about managing compatibility, and restricting dependencies through visibility isn't directly addressed.
- Refactor: No Match - There's no mention of refactoring code to remove duplication or reassign responsibilities.
- Abstract Common Services: No Match - The text does not talk about abstracting services for common functionalities.
- Component Replacement: No Match - This tactic involves replacing components at build time, but the methods described are more about configuration and runtime binding rather than replacement.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No Match - None of the installation methods mentioned bind values at compile time through parameterization.
- Aspects: No Match - Aspect-oriented programming isn't referenced in the text.
- Configuration-time Binding: No Match - The trigger is not about binding dependencies during configuration, but rather providing multiple ways to handle them.
- Resource Files: No Match - There's no mention of using resource files for dependency management.
- Runtime Registration: No Match - Although some installations might be done at runtime (like from source), the text doesn't specify registering services dynamically.
- Dynamic Lookup: No Match - The text does not describe binding dependencies through dynamic service lookup.
- Interpret Parameters: No Match - This tactic involves interpreting parameters to bind values, but the methods described are more about direct installation commands or environment setup.
- Startup Time Binding: No Match - While some installations might be done at startup (like activating a virtual environment), it's not directly linked to binding dependencies in this context.
- Name Servers: No Match - There is no mention of name servers for service discovery.
- Plug-ins: No Match - The text does not discuss plug-in architectures or runtime loading of components.
- Publish-Subscribe: No Match - This pattern isn't mentioned, and the trigger doesn't relate to event-driven binding.
- Shared Repositories: No Match - There's no talk about sharing repositories for dependency management.
- Polymorphism: No Match - The text does not involve runtime polymorphic behavior or interfaces.",None,"The architectural trigger is the need to manage dependencies and provide alternative installation methods, but none of the available tactics directly address this issue as described in the text.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

The goal was to ensure users can easily install both scispacy and its models without manual intervention for compatibility.,"For each tactic, analyze if it addresses the trigger:
- Split Module: No match (the text is about installation, not code structure).
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No match (no mention of improving module meaning or reducing side effects).
- Encapsulate: No match (no explicit interface mentioned for scispacy).
- Use an Intermediary: No match (no intermediary breaking dependencies in the text).
- Restrict Dependencies: No match (the text doesn't restrict how scispacy is used, but rather focuses on installation and model compatibility).
- Refactor: No match (not about code restructuring or removing duplication).
- Abstract Common Services: This tactic involves creating a general form for similar services. The text describes installing models that are compatible with specific versions of scispacy, which might be seen as abstracting the binding process but doesn't directly address encapsulating common installation logic.
- Component Replacement: No match (binding is done via download or install command, not through build script replacements).
- Compile-time Parameterization: No match (the model version isn't bound at compile time; it's determined by scispacy version during runtime or initialization).
- Aspects**: The text doesn't mention aspects. It describes the installation process.
- Configuration-time Binding: This tactic binds values at deployment time through configuration. In the context of this text, binding refers to linking model versions with scispacy versions. However, the models are downloaded based on the user's choice or from a URL that matches their version, which is done during setup and not necessarily via explicit configuration files.
- Resource Files: No match (no resource files like .properties mentioned for binding).
- Runtime Registration**: The text doesn't mention runtime registration. It describes static download URLs.
- Dynamic Lookup: No match (the models are downloaded from fixed URLs, no dynamic lookup at runtime).
- Interpret Parameters: This tactic involves binding values by interpreting parameters at runtime. In the context of scispacy installation, it might refer to how model versions are determined based on input during setup or command line. The text suggests that users should download a model whose URL contains the version number matching their `scispacy` version, which is somewhat similar but not exactly parameter interpretation.
- Startup Time Binding: This tactic binds values at runtime during startup. In scispacy's case, it might involve loading models based on configuration set during startup. The text shows that after installation, users load the model with a simple import and `spacy.load`, which doesn't explicitly bind the model version at startup but relies on spaCy's internal mechanism.
- Name Servers: No match (no name servers used for binding).
- Plug-ins**: This tactic allows adding functionality at runtime. In scispacy, models are installed separately from the main package and then loaded based on their compatibility with `scipy` version. While it could be seen as a form of plug-in if we consider that different model versions can be plugged in by installing them appropriately, this is not explicitly mentioned or structured as such.
- Publish-Subscribe: No match (not used for binding values).
- Shared Repositories: This tactic involves using shared repositories to bind values. In scispacy's installation process, models are stored separately and users download specific ones based on their `scipy` version. There isn't a shared repository mechanism mentioned.
- Polymorphism: No match (the text doesn't describe polymorphic behavior for model loading).",Configuration-time Binding,"The selected tactic, Configuration-time Binding, addresses the architectural trigger by ensuring that users bind the correct model version during deployment.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""local) UMLS subsets; Hi scispacy team,. First of all, thanks for creating a great tool, I think it's very useful! I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**. From the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf), I understand that scispacy links entities to UMLS concepts from sections 0, 1, 2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS 2017 AA release"". Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. . **Custom UMLS linker**. Somewhat related to 234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)? The reason I'm asking is twofold:. 1. UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy. Unless you're planning to do frequent updates on the model, I'd like to be able to use the most frequent concepts. 2. UMLS is highly customisable; users can select their own subsets of the many [vocabularies](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html). It would be great if this customisability is also applied in scispacy. My understanding is that it is possible by:. - Converting a UMLS `MRCONSO.RFF` file to JSON using [export_uml_json.py](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/export_uml_json.py). - Generating a [KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/linking_utils.py#L45) object . - Training a new linker using [create_tfidf_ann_index()](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L325 ).""
","The text discusses the possibility of integrating scispacy with local UMLS subsets for users with licenses, addressing limitations in detecting new concepts like COVID-19 and enabling customization.","The core problem is that the current system does not support using updated or custom UMLS subsets without relying on pre-trained models, leading to a need for runtime binding of these resources.","For each tactic in the list, I will analyze if it directly addresses the architectural trigger. The trigger is about supporting dynamic updates and customization of data sources (UMLS) at different times.

- Split Module: This tactic refines modules to reduce change costs but doesn't specifically address binding values or resources dynamically. No Match.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: Focuses on moving unrelated responsibilities, not directly related to runtime resource binding. No Match.
- Encapsulate: Introduces an interface to limit dependency propagation; while it might help in managing UMLS interactions, it doesn't inherently support dynamic binding or customization of the data source itself. No Match.
- Use an Intermediary: Breaks dependencies by using a mediator; this could be relevant if we consider an intermediary for handling different UMLS sources but isn't explicitly mentioned as such. The text talks about runtime registration and other methods, so it's not clear without more context. Let's see the definition again - breaking dependency between responsibilities. In this case, the issue is binding values (UMLS subsets) at runtime, which might be achieved by encapsulation or intermediaries but let's check each tactic.
- Restrict Dependencies: This restricts what modules can interact with; while it could help in controlling access to UMLS resources, it doesn't directly address how to bind them dynamically. No Match.
- Refactor: Helps reduce duplication by factoring out common services, which might be useful for code related to UMLS but not specifically about runtime binding or dynamic updates. The trigger is more about the mechanism of binding than reducing duplication elsewhere. No Match.
- Abstract Common Services: Creates a general form for similar services; this could help in defining an abstract linker that can use different implementations (like local vs remote) but doesn't directly specify how to bind at runtime. However, it might be part of enabling polymorphism or other tactics. Let's see the definition - binding values at compile time or build time? No, the tactic is about implementing similar services once in a more general form to reduce modification costs. The trigger involves runtime binding (like using local subsets), so this doesn't directly match as it doesn't specify the timing of binding. But note that abstract common services might be used for different bindings at compile time or other times? Not necessarily, but let's compare with others.
- Component Replacement: Binds values by replacing components in build scripts; this is static and not suitable for runtime updates like UMLS subsets which change periodically. No Match.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Static binding through parameters during compilation; doesn't support the dynamic nature of UMLS releases or custom subsets at runtime. No Match.
- Aspects**: Aspect-oriented programming can bind cross-cutting concerns, but here we're talking about data sources and their availability. Not directly applicable unless aspects are used to handle configuration changes, which isn't indicated in the text. The trigger is about binding values (UMLS concepts) dynamically based on user's license or updates. No Match.
- Configuration-time Binding: Binds at deployment time through config; UMLS subsets might be installed during setup but not necessarily bound via config files for runtime use. Also, the paper mentions sections 0,1,2,9 and the team is discussing adding this to README, so it's more about static information than dynamic binding. No Match.
- Resource Files: Binds values at startup using resource files; This could be relevant if UMLS subsets are loaded from a file during initialization. The text mentions converting MRCONSO.RFF to JSON and then generating a KnowledgeBase object, which might involve loading resources at startup or runtime. Let's see the definition - binding values at startup or initialization time. In scispacy, it seems users can generate their own KB objects from local files, so this tactic could apply if we consider that as startup-time binding.
- Runtime Registration: Binds values during program execution; This would allow for dynamic updates without restart. The text suggests using a custom UMLS subset which might require retraining the model at runtime or upon update? Not exactly clear, but it mentions generating KB objects and training new linker, so there's some setup involved.
- Dynamic Lookup: Binds values through runtime lookup; This could be useful if services are looked up dynamically based on configuration. But in this case, UMLS is a specific database with subsets, not necessarily something that can be looked up via a service registry or dynamic mechanisms like DNS. No Match.
- Interpret Parameters**: Binds values by interpreting parameters at runtime; The text doesn't mention parameter interpretation for the linker functionality itself but rather steps to generate and use custom KBs. This might involve command-line arguments or configuration, so it could be applicable if users can pass in different UMLS sources via parameters.
- Startup Time Binding: Binds values during startup (e.g., from config files); If we consider that loading a local UMLS subset is done at startup by reading the resource file, then this tactic applies. The text mentions converting to JSON and generating KB object, which might be part of startup initialization.
- Name Servers**: Not relevant for data sources like UMLS; it's about runtime binding via name servers (e.g., DNS or service registries). No Match.
- Plug-ins: Binds values at runtime by allowing plug-in modules. This could work if scispacy supports different implementations of the linker as plugins, but from the text, we don't see that mentioned; instead, it's about using local files and retraining. However, this is a common way to handle plugin architectures.
- Publish-Subscribe: Binds values via pub/sub pattern? This seems more for communication between components rather than binding data sources or services at runtime. No Match.
- Shared Repositories**: Binds by sharing repositories; In the context of UMLS, if multiple modules share a single repository (like in-memory), then this could be used to bind common services. But scispacy's approach seems more about having separate KB objects for different sources.

Now, let's map these to our trigger: The architectural_trigger is that the system needs to support binding UMLS concepts at runtime using local subsets or updated versions without changing core logic (like the model). So we're looking for tactics that enable dynamic binding of data sources/services.

- Component Replacement: No, because it binds statically via build scripts.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No, static during compilation.
- Aspects: Not directly applicable.
- Configuration-time Binding: Binds at deployment time; UMLS subsets are released twice a year and users might want to update without retraining the model. But configuration-time binding is about setup before runtime, not necessarily dynamic updates.
- Resource Files: Yes, if we bind by loading from resource files at startup (which could be updated). The text mentions converting MRCONSO.RFF to JSON which might be stored as a resource file and then loaded during initialization.
- Runtime Registration: Could allow updating the UMLS subset without restarting, but scispacy's method seems more about generating KB objects once. However, if users can register new subsets at runtime, that would match.
- Dynamic Lookup: Not applicable for database sources like UMLS.
- Interpret Parameters: If parameters are used to specify which UMLS source to use (e.g., via command line or config), then yes. The text doesn't explicitly say this but implies users can configure the system with their own subset.
- Startup Time Binding: Directly matches if binding is done at startup, as in loading a custom KB from local files.
- Plug-ins: If scispacy allows different UMLS implementations as plug-ins, then yes. But from the text, it's not clear; instead, they are using existing methods to generate KBs and train models.

The strongest match seems to be 'Runtime Registration' or 'Startup Time Binding'. However, looking at the definitions again:
- Runtime Registration: Binds values by registering them during runtime (e.g., via a registry). In scispacy, if users can register new UMLS subsets dynamically after startup, that would fit.
- Startup Time Binding: Binds by loading from resource files or config at startup. The text suggests converting to JSON and then generating KB object, which might be part of the initial setup when starting the program.

But note: The trigger is about supporting multiple interchangeable data sources (UMLS subsets) without changing core logic. This can be achieved through various tactics including polymorphism if we have an abstract linker that takes different implementations at runtime.

Looking back, 'Polymorphism' is a tactic in Defer Binding category and it binds values at runtime by using different types or interfaces for the same operation. The text mentions training a new linker with custom UMLS subset, which might imply creating a polymorphic interface where the actual implementation can vary based on the data source.

Also, 'Plug-ins' is another way to achieve this if we have a plugin mechanism that loads different services at runtime.

But from the provided text, it's not explicitly about plugins or polymorphism. It's more about being able to use local files and retrain the model. However, the core issue is enabling users to bind their own UMLS subsets (which are updated) without modifying the main code.

The best fit might be 'Runtime Registration' if we consider that after generating a KB object from a file, it can be registered for use by the linker during runtime. But scispacy's example doesn't show this; instead, they train a new linker with the custom subset. That could be seen as part of startup time binding.

Alternatively, 'Configuration-time Binding' might not fit because deployment time is static and UMLS updates require more dynamic handling.

Let me re-express the trigger: The system needs to support interchangeable data sources (UMLS subsets) at runtime without changing core logic. This can be achieved by:
- Having an abstract service that can be implemented differently for different UMLS sources, which is polymorphism.
- Or by allowing users to register their own implementations or services via plug-ins.

In the text, they are suggesting a way to use local subsets by converting files and generating KB objects. This doesn't necessarily imply runtime registration but could be part of startup initialization (Startup Time Binding) or even compile-time if done in build scripts (but not mentioned). However, since UMLS is released periodically, users might want to update the subset without restarting the application, which would require runtime binding.

But scispacy's approach seems to involve retraining the model with the new KB object. Retraining implies that a new instance of the linker is created at startup or when needed. So it could be seen as part of Startup Time Binding if done during initialization, but not necessarily dynamic updates without restart.

Given this, let's see which tactics are defined to handle runtime binding:
- Runtime Registration: Binds by registering at runtime (e.g., via a registry). This would allow updating the UMLS subset dynamically.
- Dynamic Lookup: Binds through lookup services at runtime. Not directly applicable for database sources.
- Startup Time Binding: Binds during startup, which might not be dynamic enough if updates are frequent and require no restart.

The text doesn't explicitly mention a mechanism for updating without restarting, so perhaps 'Runtime Registration' is the best fit because it allows binding at runtime. However, scispacy's method of training a new linker with custom KB suggests that this is done once per application start or when creating the model, not necessarily dynamically during execution.

But note: The trigger also includes supporting local UMLS subsets (which are installed) and updated versions (like 2020AA). This can be achieved by binding these at runtime if we have a way to change which subset is used without changing code. In scispacy, the core logic of the model might not need to change; it's just that the data source changes.

The tactic 'Plug-ins' allows for loading different implementations at runtime based on configuration or user choice. This could be implemented by having a plugin system where users can specify which UMLS provider (local vs remote) they want, but again, from text not clear.

Alternatively, if we look at the Defer Binding category, 'Runtime Registration' and 'Dynamic Lookup' are for runtime binding via external services or registries. For data sources like databases with subsets, it's more common to use configuration files or parameters that specify which database to connect to, but scispacy is using a KB object approach.

Another way: The trigger can be interpreted as needing to defer the binding of specific UMLS subset implementation until runtime (or configurable time). This fits 'Defer Binding' tactics like polymorphism and plug-ins. But since the text doesn't mention these, we have to go by what's described.

The most direct tactic mentioned in the text is that users can generate a KB object from local files and then use it for training. So if this generation is part of the system initialization (startup), then 'Startup Time Binding' applies. If they want to update without restarting, then we need a mechanism like runtime registration.

But scispacy's example doesn't show that; instead, they are suggesting a static way to use local files and retrain the model with them. So perhaps it's more about Startup Time Binding or even Configuration-time Binding if done via config files (but not mentioned). However, let's look at the definitions again:
- Resource Files: Binds by using resource files loaded at startup.
- Startup Time Binding: Same as above.

The text says: 'generating a KnowledgeBase object from local UMLS subset' and then training a new linker with that. This is done once, so it's static binding unless the user can do it multiple times (e.g., dynamically). But without explicit mention of dynamic updates or runtime registration, I think the closest tactic is 'Startup Time Binding'.

However, let's consider if there's another way: The system needs to be able to use different UMLS subsets interchangeably. This suggests that we should have a mechanism for binding the data source (UMLS subset) at startup without changing core logic. So tactics like Startup Time Binding or even Configuration-time Binding might fit.

But note: The trigger says 'without changing core logic'. In scispacy, by allowing users to generate their own KB objects and train models with them, they are not changing the core linker code but just providing a way to bind different data sources. This is similar to having an interface that can be configured at startup.

The tactics in Defer Binding category (Defer Binding) include:
- Runtime Registration: Binds during runtime via registration.
- Dynamic Lookup: Not applicable.
- Interpret Parameters: If parameters are used, it binds at runtime by interpreting them. But the text doesn't mention this explicitly for the linker's core logic.

But wait, let's look again at the trigger definition from the user: The system needs to support interchangeable data sources (UMLS subsets) without changing core logic. This is a classic case for polymorphism or plugin architectures. However, in the provided text, they are not using these; instead, they are modifying the model creation process.

The best fit might be 'Runtime Registration' because it allows binding at runtime by registering services dynamically. But scispacy's method doesn't seem to support that explicitly. Alternatively, if we consider that after generating a KB object (which is part of startup), then using that for the linker via an abstract interface would be Startup Time Binding.

But note: The trigger also includes supporting multiple interchangeable data sources without changing core logic. This can be achieved by having an abstract base class or interface for the UMLS service, and then different implementations (like one for local, one for remote) that are bound at runtime via polymorphism.

Looking back at the text, they mention 'sections 0,1,2,9' from the paper and also want to use a custom subset. This suggests that the core logic of the linker should remain unchanged while allowing different implementations based on available UMLS sources.

This is exactly what polymorphism does: by having an abstract base class for the service (linker) and then providing multiple derived classes or interfaces for different data sources, but in scispacy it's not clear if they have a common interface. However, from the text, they are training a new linker with custom KB object, which might be done through a polymorphic function call.

But let's stick to the provided definitions and see what is available:
- Plug-ins: This would allow binding at runtime by loading different implementations as plugins. Not mentioned in the text.
- Runtime Registration: If we have a registry that can register new services (linker implementations) at runtime, then yes. But scispacy doesn't seem to use this; instead, they are using existing classes and methods.

Given the lack of explicit mention for dynamic updates without restart, I think 'Runtime Registration' might not be directly supported by scispacy's current method. However, if we consider that users can register their own UMLS subset at runtime (e.g., via a configuration file or command line) then it could fit.

But the text doesn't say anything about registration; it says to train a new linker with custom KB. So perhaps 'Startup Time Binding' is more appropriate because binding occurs during startup by loading from resource files.

Let's compare the definitions:
- Startup Time Binding: Binds values at startup (e.g., via config or resource files). This matches if we bind by reading and converting local UMLS files when starting the application. The text suggests this method for using custom subsets, so it fits.
- Runtime Registration: Not explicitly mentioned in the text as a feature of scispacy's architecture; they are not registering services during runtime but rather generating them once.

Therefore, I think 'Startup Time Binding' is the best fit because that's what the user is describing - binding by loading from local files at startup. But note: The trigger also includes supporting updated UMLS subsets (released twice a year). If users update their subset and want to use it without restarting, then Startup Time Binding might not be sufficient if done only once per start. However, in practice, for scispacy's model, they would likely restart the application or retrain periodically.

But from the text, we don't have information about dynamic updates during runtime; instead, it's about being able to use local subsets by generating a KB object and then training the model with that. This is done once per user setup or update, so it fits Startup Time Binding (if done at startup) but not necessarily runtime registration.

However, let's look for tactics that allow binding without changing core logic:
- Plug-ins: If scispacy had a plugin system where different UMLS implementations are plug-in modules, then users could register their own implementation. But from the text, it's not mentioned; instead, they are using existing KB generation methods.

Given all this, I think the most appropriate tactic is 'Startup Time Binding' because that's what scispacy does: binds by loading a custom resource (the local UMLS subset) at startup via generating a KnowledgeBase object from JSON files. This allows users to use their own data source without changing core logic.

But wait, there are two tactics in the Defer Binding category for runtime binding:
- Runtime Registration and Dynamic Lookup might not be directly applicable.
- Startup Time Binding is part of Defer Binding but binds at startup.

Also, 'Configuration-time Binding' (which is config files) could be used if we have a configuration file that specifies which UMLS subset to use. But the text doesn't mention config files; it's about converting and generating KB objects.

Another possibility: The trigger might also fit 'Polymorphism'. Let me check the definition of polymorphism in Defer Binding:
- Polymorphism (Defer Binding): Binds values at runtime by using different types for the same interface. In scispacy, if we have an abstract base class for the linker and then a concrete class that implements it differently based on UMLS subset, then when you create an instance of the custom linker, it's bound via polymorphism.

But from the text, they are training a new model with the custom KB. That might be done by creating a different implementation at startup or upon user request, but not necessarily through polymorphism if we consider that as part of the core logic change (but no, because the core linker is still using the same algorithm). Actually, it's more about configuration than binding via polymorphism.

Given the complexity and lack of clear definition in scispacy for dynamic updates without restart, I think 'Startup Time Binding' or 'Runtime Registration' might not be fully supported. But since UMLS subsets are released periodically, users would benefit from a way to update them at runtime if possible.

However, based on the text provided, it's more about being able to use local files and retrain than about dynamic updates without restart. So perhaps 'Runtime Registration' is not directly applicable because scispacy doesn't have a built-in mechanism for that; instead, they are suggesting a static way (via KB generation) or even part of the model creation.

But note: The trigger includes supporting multiple interchangeable data sources (local vs remote). This can be achieved by having an interface and binding at runtime based on configuration. So I think 'Startup Time Binding' is still the best fit because that's what they are doing - binding a specific implementation to the system at startup.

Let me summarize: The user wants to know which design pattern or architectural concept this corresponds to, but we have multiple possibilities. However, since the text doesn't explicitly mention any of these, I think 'Startup Time Binding' is the most straightforward answer because that's what they are doing - binding by loading a resource at startup.

But wait, let's look at the options again:
- The user didn't provide specific options for Defer Binding; we have to choose from the available tactics. Let me re-read the definitions of each tactic in Defer Binding category and see which one is most appropriate.

Defer Binding includes: Delayed binding or late binding, where a function call doesn't specify which implementation it will use until runtime (like virtual functions). But scispacy's method seems more like configuration-based binding rather than polymorphism. However, if we look at the core logic not changing, then any of these might fit.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to simplify: The user wants to use different UMLS subsets without modifying the code. This is typically done by having a configuration file or parameter that specifies which subset to use, and then binding occurs at startup based on that config. But again, not mentioned.

The text says they are generating a KB object from local files, so it's more about data preparation than runtime binding via polymorphism or plugins.

After careful thought, I think the best answer is 'Startup Time Binding' because that's what scispacy does: binds by loading and preparing the data source at startup. This allows users to use different U  ",Startup Time Binding,"The user can generate a KnowledgeBase object from local files, which is part of the system initialization (startup) and then bind it to the model without changing core logic."

","The text describes changes made to a software project, specifically scispacy, including updates for Python 3.12 support by modifying dependencies and adding new contributors.",The core problem or trigger is the need to update dependencies to add support for a newer version of Python (3.12) while maintaining compatibility with existing codebase components.,"For each available tactic, analyze if it addresses the architectural trigger:

- **Discover Service**: This involves locating services at runtime through a directory service. The text does not mention any service discovery mechanism or runtime location of services; instead, it focuses on updating specific dependencies (scipy and nmslib) for Python 3.12 support. Therefore, this tactic does not directly address the trigger.

- **Orchestrate**: This uses a control mechanism to coordinate multiple services that may be unaware of each other. The text describes updates to dependencies but does not indicate any change in how these services are coordinated or sequenced; it's about replacing one service with another and updating interfaces for compatibility. However, the trigger is about managing dependency changes without altering core logic, which might involve orchestration if there were multiple services being managed together, but here it's more specific to interface adaptation. Thus, this tactic does not directly match.

- **Tailor Interface**: This adds or removes capabilities to an interface, such as translation or buffering, often to adapt to different environments or requirements. The text mentions updating scipy and using nmslib-metabrainz instead of nmslib, which implies adapting the interfaces for Python 3.12 compatibility (e.g., ensuring that the new service can be used without changing the core logic). This directly addresses the need to tailor how services are presented or adapted to work with different versions or environments.",Tailor Interface,"The Tailor Interface tactic is applied by updating scipy and replacing nmslib with nmslib-metabrainz, which adapts the interface for Python 3.12 compatibility without altering the core logic."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced. [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md). in v1.1. Why am I seeing CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error while running on GPU? We have been observing the following message while running on GPU since we moved. platform from slim to keras:. ```bash. 2023-10-20 22:21:03.818638: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error. ```. We. have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So. you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models? 16GB. In our test, we observe the model occupying 16GB GPU memory. Do models from before r1.6.0 work with current inference code? No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in. Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs? No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU. inference yet. Can model_train be run on multiple GPUs? No. TensorFlow's Estimator API does provide support for running training on. multiple GPUs through the use of a DistributionStrategy. However,.

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- Split Module: No Match. The text does not mention splitting modules.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No Match. There's no discussion about moving unrelated responsibilities.

- Use an Intermediary: No Match. The text does not indicate breaking dependencies with an intermediary.
- Restrict Dependencies: No Match. There's no mention of restricting which modules interact with others.
- Refactor: No Match. While there are references to scripts, the tactic evaluation requires direct addressing of the trigger; refactoring isn't explicitly mentioned or implied as a solution here.
- Abstract Common Services: This could be relevant if we were to create an abstract service for language handling that multiple languages implement. However, the text does not describe such an abstraction but rather focuses on generating specific files (JSONL) and modifying scripts for each language separately. No Match.
- Component Replacement: No Match. The text doesn't suggest replacing components at compile time or build time.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Not directly addressed in the text, as there's no mention of parameterizing code to handle different languages at compile time.
- Aspects**: No match. There is no discussion about aspects for language support.
- Configuration-time Binding: The text mentions changing a script (export_umls_json.py) and references to other files that need generation for another language, but it doesn't specify if these bindings are done via configuration at deployment time.

""How do I control the number of threads for call_variants?; I'm trying to build a scatter gather implementation of make_calls -> call_variants -> post_processing, without using GNU parallel, and since multiple shards of call_variants, even with num_readers set to 1, increases the system load well beyond the number of cores, I'd like to try to limit this to a 1:1 ratio where one shard produces a system load of 1. Is this possible? This is essentially what my pipeline looks like today: https://github.com/oskarvid/wdl_deepvariant/blob/master/deepvar-simple-SG.wdl. I say essentially because I've made insignificant changes, like added --num_readers for example. . One way would be to try to combine all tfrecord files into one, because wdl cannot use your method of using all output files from make_calls as input files for call_variants, inputFile@#shards.gz doesn't compute for wdl, and using wdl's normal way of handling multiple input files, i.e --examples ${sep= --examples InputFile} doesn't work either since call_variants only takes the last --examples as input when there are many --examples in the command. Regarding combining the tfrecord files before they're used as input for call_variants, I'm not familiar enough with tensorflow to know if it's at all possible, and a quick google search didn't return anything fruitful. Is it possible to combine many tfrecord files into one? Is it easier to try to limit the number of threads per process instead of trying to combine the tfrecord files? Or is there a third method that solves this problem better? And thanks for a great tool!""

",The user is asking about resources used for abbreviation disambiguation in Scispacy's AbbreviationDetector component.,"The core problem or trigger described is the need to understand and potentially access external resources (dictionaries, databases) for abbreviation disambiguation within the Scispacy system.","For each tactic from the list: 1. Split Module - Does not directly address the trigger as it focuses on module size reduction, not resource handling or disambiguation logic. 2. Increase Semantic Coherence - Not relevant to the trigger since no mention of responsibilities being moved between modules for this purpose. 3. Encapsulate - Focuses on reducing coupling via interfaces, but the trigger is about accessing resources, so it doesn't match directly. 4. Use an Intermediary - This could be a possibility if there's an intermediary handling the disambiguation logic and data sources, but no such description in text. 5. Restrict Dependencies - Not relevant as the user wants to access or examine existing dependencies. 6. Refactor - The trigger is about understanding resources, not refactoring code for duplication reduction. 7. Abstract Common Services - This might be related if disambiguation services are abstracted and reused elsewhere, but no direct evidence in text. 8. Component Replacement - Not relevant as there's no mention of replacing components with others. 9. Compile-time Parameterization - The trigger is about runtime or deployment time resources, not compile-time binding. 10. Aspects - No aspect-based approach mentioned for disambulation logic. 11. Configuration-time Binding - This could be a match if the user can configure the system at deployment to use specific dictionaries or databases. However, the text doesn't specify that configuration is used for this purpose; it's more about understanding existing resources and their availability. 12. Resource Files - If Scispacy uses resource files (like XML or JSON) for storing abbreviation mappings, then this tactic would match. The user specifically asks if such a resource exists and can be examined, so there might be an intermediary file holding the data. 13. Runtime Registration - This is about binding values at runtime through registration mechanisms. If Scispacy allows users to register dictionaries or databases during initialization, it could apply. However, no mention of user-driven registration in text; it's more about internal resources. 14. Dynamic Lookup - Not relevant as the trigger doesn't involve looking up services dynamically without a specific resource. 15. Interpret Parameters - This might be related if disambiguation is done by interpreting input parameters (like context) to determine meaning, but no such description in text; it's about using resources for mapping. 16. Startup Time Binding - If the system loads abbreviation dictionaries at startup from configuration or files, this could match. The user asks about examining how comprehensive and up-to-date the resource is, which might imply that the resource is loaded during initialization (startup). 17. Name Servers: Not relevant for disambiguation resources unless it's a distributed system aspect. 18. Plug-ins: If Scispacy supports plug-in modules for custom abbreviation dictionaries, this could be applicable. However, no mention of plugins in text; the user is asking about existing resources and their details. 19. Publish-Subscribe: Not relevant as there's no event-driven disambiguation mechanism described. 20. Shared Repositories: This involves multiple components sharing a common data repository for abbreviation mappings. If Scispacy uses such shared repositories, it could match the trigger of having accessible resources. But again, no explicit mention in text; user is focused on one component's resource usage. 21.

1. **Discover Service**: This involves locating services through a directory at runtime. The text does not mention any service discovery mechanism or dependency on external directories; instead, it focuses on retraining models and rewriting code for compatibility. Therefore, this tactic does not directly address the issue.

2. **Orchestrate**: Orchestration is about coordinating multiple services with a control mechanism. In the provided text, there's no indication of managing interactions between different services or using orchestration to handle their sequences; it's more about adapting components for compatibility and introducing an experimental pipe. Thus, this does not match.

The text mentions retraining models (which might involve interface changes) but the primary focus is on making them compatible with spaCy 2.2.1 and rewriting a pipe using pysbd, which could be seen as tailoring an existing functionality to work with new tools. However, there's no explicit mention of altering interfaces for different capabilities or hiding functions from untrusted users; it's about compatibility and integration rather than interface customization.",None,"The selected tactic 'None' because the changes described in the text involve retraining models for library compatibility and rewriting a pipe with an experimental tool, which do not directly correspond to any of the defined tactics (Discover Service, Orchestrate, Tailor Interface) as they lack explicit service discovery, orchestration coordination, or interface tailoring mechanisms."

The checkpoint generally contains all of the variables in the graph during training, including things like the backprop variables, moving averages for visualization, etc. Simply restoring all of those variables is brittle, as we often want to start a new training run, maybe using a different optimizer, different visualization variables, or replacing part of the model with a new classification layer, as unneeded variables from the checkpoint get loaded into the graph and/or new TF variables not present in the graph cannot be found, raising exceptions. This function allows a clean API to get just the *model* variables from a graph, excluding all of those non-model variables, along with optionally removing parts of the model graph via exclude scopes. This function calls slim.get_model_variables() to get the raw list of all variables associated with the MODEL_VARIABLES collection.

For example, suppose we have a model with three variables with names: w1 = model/l1/weight1 w2 = model/l2/weight2 w3 = model/l2/weight3 Without any exclude scopes, we would return these three variables [w1, w2, and w3]. Providing exclude_scopes=['model/l2'] would return only [w1], while exclude_scopes=['model/l1'] would return [w2, w3]. Args: exclude_scopes: None, or a list of strings.

The checkpoint generally contains all of the variables in the graph during training, including things like the backprop variables, moving averages for visualization, etc. Simply restoring all of those variables is brittle, as we often want to start a new training run, maybe using a different optimizer, different visualization variables, or replacing part of the model with a new classification layer, as unneeded variables from the checkpoint get loaded into the graph and/or new TF variables not present in the graph cannot be found, raising exceptions. This function allows a clean API to get just the *model* variables from a graph, excluding all of those non-model variables, along with optionally removing parts of the model graph via exclude scopes. This function calls slim.get_model_variables() to get the raw list of all variables associated with the MODEL_VARIABLES collection. It then filters away all variables that match any of the scopes in exclude_scopes. For example, suppose we have a model with three variables with names: w1 = model/l1/weight1 w2 = model/l2/weight2 w3 = model/l2/weight3 Without any exclude scopes, we would return these three variables [w1, w2, and w3]. Providing exclude_scopes=['model/l2'] would return only [w1], while exclude_scopes=['model/l1'] would return [w2, w3]. Args: exclude_scopes: None, or a list of strings. Each string is a scope specification, such as model/l1 to match all variables whose name starts with model/l1"". Returns: A list of tf.Variable objects.""
","The text describes a function that retrieves and filters TensorFlow model variables from a checkpoint, allowing users to specify which scopes to exclude. This helps avoid loading unnecessary or incompatible variables during restoration.","The core problem is the brittleness of restoring all variables from a checkpoint in a machine learning model, as it may include non-essential ones causing exceptions when starting new training runs with modifications.","Ping/Echo: No match.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

40,integrability,"Convert nmslib to annoy; This PR removes the dependency on `nmslib` and switches to `annoy` by Spotify [link](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) which appears to be more actively maintained and is a C++ library. All of the changes happen inside `scispacy/candidate_generation.py` since, as far as I could tell, that is where `nmslib` was used. **Important**: Due to `nmslib` not working on my personal computer and me not knowing how to evaluate these changes and the requirements (i.e. generating UMLS knowledge base, indices as are, new indices, and some evaluation metric) I have not actually run this code so it quite likely breaks. I wanted to move beyond an issue since I really like this project and hope to use it at UK and I think this PR serves as a proof of concept for how it may not be _that_ complex to switch off of `nmslib`... then again I could be completely wrong 😄 .

""Convert nmslib to annoy; This PR removes the dependency on `nmslib` and switches to `annoy` by Spotify [link](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) which appears to be more actively maintained and is a C++ library. All of the changes happen inside `scispacy/candidate_generation.py` since, as far as I could tell, that is where `nmslib` was used. **Important**: Due to `nmslib` not working on my personal computer and me not knowing how to evaluate these changes and the requirements (i.e. generating UMLS knowledge base, indices as are, new indices, and some evaluation metric) I have not actually run this code so it quite likely breaks. I wanted to move beyond an issue since I really like this project and hope to use it at UK and I think this PR serves as a proof of concept for how it may not be _that_ complex to switch off of `nmslib`... then again I could be completely wrong 😄 .

","The text discusses the process of replacing a dependency from nmslib to annoy in code, mentioning that annoy is a C++ library supporting cosine distance via Euclidean space conversion. It mentions specific changes made in a file called scispacy/candidate.py and other files like `scispacy/visualize.py` might be affected but not changed.","The text describes the replacement of an indexing method or dependency, specifically replacing nmslib with annoy for cosine similarity search. This suggests that the system was facing issues with nmslib (likely a typo for 'nmslib') which is not working on the user's machine, and they are switching to annoy because it supports cosine distance via Euclidean space conversion.","The tactic used in this text involves replacing one library or service dependency (`nmslib`) with another (`annoy`). This aligns with the 'Replace Conditional Logic' tactic from the list of tactics, as it replaces a component (the nmslib) with an alternative that provides similar functionality but with different implementation details. However, since the trigger is about replacing a library for better support on certain platforms or features, and considering the context might be related to system design patterns, I think this could also relate to 'Replace Component' tactic which involves substituting one component with another.",None,"The text does not explicitly describe a specific architectural pattern but rather describes a code change.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

14,deployability,", I think it's very useful! I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**. From the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf), I understand that scispacy links entities to UMLS concepts from sections 0, 1, 2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS 2017 AA release"". Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. . **Custom UMLS linker**. Somewhat related to 234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)? The reason I'm asking is twofold:. 1. UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy. Unless you're planning to do frequent updates on the model, I'd like to be able to use the most frequent concepts. 2. UMLS is highly customisable; users can select their own subsets of the many [vocabularies](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html). It would be great if this customisability is also applied in scispacy. My understanding is that it is possible by:. - Converting a UMLS `MRCONSO.RFF` file to JSON using [export_uml_json.py](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/export_uml_json.py). - Generating a [KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/linking_utils.py#L45) object . - Training a new linker using [create_tfidf_ann_index()](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L325 ). Is this correct? Any help or more detailed instructions would be greatly appreciated!","

## Text To Analyze:
"", I think it's very useful! I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**. From the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf), I understand that scispacy links entities to UMLS concepts from sections 0, 1, 2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS 2017 AA release"". Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. . **Custom UMLS linker**. Somewhat related to 234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)? The reason I'm asking is twofold:. 1. UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy. Unless you're planning to do frequent updates on the model, I'd like to be able to use the most frequent concepts. 2. UMLS is highly customisable; users can select their own subsets of the many [vocabularies](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html). It would be great if this customisability is also applied in scispacy. My understanding is that it is possible by:. - Converting a UMLS `MRCONSO.RFF` file to JSON using [export_uml_json.py](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/export_uml_json.py). - Generating a [KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/linking_utils.py#L45) object . - Training a new linker using [create_tfidf_ann_index()](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L325 ). Is this correct? Any help or more detailed instructions would be greatly appreciated!""
",The text discusses the possibility of integrating a custom UMLS subset into scispacy's entity linker to address licensing and update issues with the UMLS database.,"The core problem is that the current scispacy UMLS linker does not support using local or updated UMLS subsets, limiting its ability to detect new concepts (like COVID-19) without model updates and restricting user customisability of UMLS vocabularies.","For each tactic in the list, I will analyze if it addresses the architectural trigger. The trigger is about supporting multiple interchangeable data sources or configurations for the UMLS linker to handle updates and custom subsets.

- Split Module: No Match - This text does not discuss splitting modules but rather extending functionality with a new feature (custom linker). It's more about adding flexibility than reducing size.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No Match - The focus is on enabling users to use their own UMLS subsets, which involves changing the system behavior. There's no mention of moving unrelated responsibilities or improving internal structure.
- Encapsulate: No Match - This text does not involve introducing an interface for encapsulation; it's about allowing direct interaction with a local subset without wrapping.
- Use an Intermediary: No Match - The custom linker approach doesn't use an intermediary to break dependencies. It directly uses the UMLS subset, so no intermediary is introduced.
- Restrict Dependencies: No Match - This tactic involves limiting interactions, but here we're expanding them by allowing direct access to local subsets and improving flexibility.
- Refactor: No Match - The text describes a new feature (custom linker) rather than refactoring existing code for better structure or reducing duplication. It's about extending capabilities.
- Abstract Common Services: No Match - This would involve creating an abstract service, but the tactic described is more concrete and specific to UMLS integration without generalization.

Now from Defer Binding category:
- Component Replacement: No Match - The custom linker isn't replacing a component at build time; it's being added as a feature. There's no mention of binding through replacement in scripts or makefiles.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No Match - This would bind values at compile time, but the text is about runtime flexibility to use different UMLS subsets (like COVID-19).
- Aspects: No Match - Aspect-oriented programming isn't mentioned; it's a straightforward extension of functionality without cross-cutting concerns.
- Configuration-time Binding: Partially related. The user can configure their system with a local subset, but the trigger is about runtime flexibility and not necessarily deployment time binding.
- Resource Files: Not directly applicable. While resource files might be used to store configuration, this text doesn't mention using them for UMLS subsets.
- Runtime Registration: This could match if users register custom services at runtime. The tactic allows generating a KnowledgeBase object from the local subset and training a new linker, which is done at runtime or upon initialization.",Runtime Registration,"The selected tactic of 'Runtime Registration' directly addresses the architectural trigger by enabling users to bind values (UMLS subsets) at runtime through registration mechanisms like generating a KnowledgeBase object and training a new linker, thus providing flexibility for updates and customisability as mentioned in the text."

","The text describes a pull request to replace the NMSLIB library with ANNOY in a Python project, specifically within scispacy/candidate_generation.py. The motivation is to use a more actively maintained C++ library that supports cosine distance via euclidean and has fewer configurable parameters.","The core problem was dependency on an outdated or problematic NMSLIB library which caused issues (not working) and the goal was to replace it with ANNOY, a different but potentially more suitable library for candidate generation in scispacy.","For each tactic from the list:
- Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules, so no match.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No discussion of improving semantic coherence or reducing side effects due to unclear responsibilities, so no match.
- Encapsulate: There is a mention of removing dependency on nmslib by switching to annoy, which could be seen as encapsulating the functionality within a different module (annoy), but it's not explicit. However, the tactic definition requires an interface and reducing propagation, while here we are replacing one library with another without changing the structure significantly. So no match.
- Use an Intermediary: No intermediary is introduced; the change is direct replacement of nmsight with annoy. No match.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text mentions removing dependency on nmslib by switching to annoy, which could be interpreted as restricting dependencies from being too broad or outdated. However, it's more about replacing than restricting. But let's see if it fits the definition: 'Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with' — here we are changing one library for another, not necessarily restricting interactions. No match.
- Refactor: The text says ""I tried to leave the code as much unchanged as possible"", so minimal refactoring was done. But it also mentions changes inside candidate_generation.py and potential issues with checks/crashes. However, the tactic evaluation requires a systematic analysis of whether refactor addresses the trigger (which is about dependency). Refactor can be part of reducing duplication or improving structure, but here we are replacing functionality without significant restructuring. No match.
- Abstract Common Services: The text does not mention abstracting common services; it's a direct replacement. No match.
- Component Replacement: This seems to fit because the PR replaces nmslib with annoy by Spotify. It is binding values (the library) at compile time or build time through component replacement, but note that in this case, we are replacing one dependency with another during development/PR process, not necessarily via build scripts. However, it's a form of component replacement where the old component is removed and new one is used.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No mention of compile-time binding or parameterization for values like libraries. The change is about runtime usage (since annoy has to be installed). But note that in the PR we are replacing nmslib with annoy, which might involve changing build scripts if needed, but not mentioned here. So no match.

","The text describes how to install scispacy, including steps for installation and upgrading, and provides details about available models along with their download URLs.","The core problem is the need to manage multiple model versions dynamically without changing the codebase during upgrades or installations. The goal was to provide a flexible way to bind model paths based on scispacy version compatibility at different stages (compile-time, runtime).","For each tactic: 
- Split Module: No Match - The text does not mention splitting modules for size reduction.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No Match - There is no discussion of moving unrelated responsibilities to reduce side effects.
- Encapsulate: No Match - Although an interface might be involved, the text doesn't explicitly introduce one; it focuses on model binding and installation.
- Use an Intermediary: No Match - The text does not describe breaking dependencies with an intermediary like a service layer or facade.
- Restrict Dependencies: No Match - There is no mention of restricting which modules can interact.
- Refactor: No Match - While there might be common code, the tactic evaluation here involves model binding and version management, not refactoring for duplication reduction.
- Abstract Common Services: No Match - The text does not show abstracting services to reduce modification costs; it's about installing specific models based on scispacy versions.
- Component Replacement: No Match - This would involve replacing components at build time, but the text describes dynamic model selection and binding during runtime or upgrade.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No Match - The text does not bind values at compile time through parameterization; upgrades require re-downloading models which is a runtime process.
- Aspects: No Match - There's no mention of using aspects to modularize concerns.
- Configuration-time Binding: No Match - Although configuration might be involved, the text binds model paths based on scispacy version at runtime or via download URLs during installation.
- Resource Files: No Match - The models are downloaded and installed from URLs, not stored in resource files for binding.
- Runtime Registration: No Match - While there is dynamic loading of models, it's done by spaCy using the model path. There's no explicit registration mechanism described.
- Dynamic Lookup: No Match - The text does not describe looking up services at runtime; instead, specific model paths are provided or determined via URLs.
- Interpret Parameters: No Match - Although parameters might be involved in version selection, there is no interpretation of parameters for binding values as a tactic mentioned.
- Startup Time Binding: No Match - This would involve loading models during startup based on configuration. The text does not specify this; it's about installing via pip or downloading and then using the model path.
- Name Servers: No Match - There is no use of name servers for service discovery or binding.
- Plug-ins: No Match - Although plug-in-like behavior might be present, there is no explicit mention of a plugin architecture where models are loaded as plugins.
- Publish-Subscribe: No Match - This tactic involves decoupling components through messaging. The text does not describe any such pattern for model binding.
- Shared Repositories: No Match - There's no indication that multiple modules share repositories or data sources to bind values.
- Polymorphism: No Match - Although the models are different, they are loaded by their paths and spaCy handles them as components. The text does not mention using polymorphic behavior for binding.",None,"The architectural trigger involves dynamic model version management based on scispacy upgrades, but none of the provided tactics directly address this issue in a manner described or implied by the text."

Use an Intermediary - Not mentioned, no intermediary is used between components. Restrict Dependencies - No change in dependencies restriction is described. Refactor - The text describes adding functionality rather than factoring out common code or responsibilities. Abstract Common Services - This component doesn't abstract existing services but adds new ones. Component Replacement - The HyponymDetector is added as a pipe, not replacing an existing one. Compile-time Parameterization - Not mentioned; the parameter 'extended' might be set at configuration time or runtime depending on context. Aspects - No aspect-based approach is described in this text. Configuration-time Binding - This could apply if the Hearst patterns are bound via configuration files during setup.

","The text describes multiple installation methods for scispaCy, including pip with specific flags and direct git cloning, along with instructions for setting up virtual environments using Mamba or Conda.",The core problem is the need to support different installation methods (including various versions of dependencies) without changing the main codebase.

- Increase Semantic Coherence: No match. There's no mention of improving module purposes or removing unrelated responsibilities.
- Encapsulate: No match. Although a virtual environment might act as an intermediary, the tactic isn't directly applied here; it's more about dependency management during installation.
- Use an Intermediary: Match. The text uses Mamba (a Conda wrapper) to manage dependencies and environments separately from scispaCy itself, which can be seen as breaking direct dependencies on specific Python versions or tools.
- Restrict Dependencies: No match. There's no explicit restriction mentioned; the focus is on providing options for installation.
- Refactor: No match. The text doesn't describe refactoring code to remove duplication in services.
- Abstract Common Services: No match. Installation isn't about abstracting common functionalities but rather binding them at different times.
- Component Replacement: Match. By allowing the use of specific flags or methods (like git+https) during installation, it's effectively replacing parts of the dependency setup with alternatives that can be compiled or installed differently.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No match. The text doesn't show binding values at compile time through parameters; some bindings are configuration-time or runtime.
- Aspects: No match. Aspect-oriented programming isn't mentioned in the context of installation methods.
- Configuration-time Binding: Match. Some installations use specific flags (like CFLAGS) during setup, which can be considered as binding dependencies via configuration files or command-line arguments at deployment time.
- Resource Files: No match. There's no mention of resource files being used for binding values.
- Runtime Registration: No match. Installation is done before runtime; the text doesn't describe registering components at runtime.
- Dynamic Lookup: No match. The installation methods don't involve dynamic lookup during execution.
- Interpret Parameters: Match. When using pip with parameters (like `pip install --no-binary :all:`), it's binding values by interpreting these flags as part of the command, which can be seen as a form of runtime parameter interpretation for dependency setup.
- Startup Time Binding: No match. The text doesn't mention binding during startup; installation is separate.
- Name Servers: No match. Not relevant to software installation or configuration.
- Plug-ins: Match. Although not explicitly stated, the ability to install scispaCy via git and load models dynamically might be seen as using plug-in-like mechanisms for model compatibility.

- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.

","This text describes the changes made in a software release for scispacy, specifically adding support for Python 3.12 by updating scipy and replacing nmslib with nmslib-metabrainz.",The core problem is ensuring compatibility of the system with newer versions of Python to avoid breakage or security vulnerabilities associated with outdated dependencies.,"For each tactic, I will analyze if it addresses the trigger. The trigger involves updating dependencies for better compatibility and support.

- **Detect Intrusion**: This is about identifying malicious patterns in traffic, not relevant here as there's no mention of attacks or security vulnerabilities.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Focuses on DDoS detection, unrelated to Python version updates.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Concerns data integrity checks, which isn't the main issue described; it's about dependency management.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Again, related to network attacks timing, not applicable here.

Now for tactics in 'Resist Attacks':

- **Identify Actors**: This is about identifying users or sources of input. The text doesn't mention actors (users) but rather code updates and dependency changes.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensures user identity through credentials etc., not relevant to this compatibility update.
- **Authorize Actors**: Controls access rights, which isn't the focus here as it's about system-wide support for a new Python version.
- **Limit Access**: Reduces resource exposure or access points. The text is about adding features and updating dependencies, so no reduction in attack surface is mentioned.
- **Limit Exposure**: Specifically reduces attack surfaces by minimizing access points. This release doesn't change the security posture but adds functionality for a new Python version.

Tactics from 'React to Attacks':

- **Revoke Access**: Not related as there's no indication of an ongoing attack or need to restrict access.
- **Lock Computer**: Also unrelated, as it deals with repeated failed login attempts on one machine.
- **Inform Actors**: The text doesn't mention notifying anyone about the changes or issues.

Tactics from 'Recover from Attacks':

- **Maintain Audit Trail**: This involves logging actions for security analysis. While not explicitly stated, maintaining a changelog could be seen as part of this, but it's more about version control than attack recovery.
- **Restore**: Refers to restoring services after an incident, which isn't the case here since we're adding support and making changes, not recovering from failure.

No tactics directly address the trigger. The trigger is about ensuring compatibility with a new Python version by updating dependencies.",None,"The architectural trigger involves updating system dependencies for better compatibility with newer software versions (Python 3.12). None of the provided tactics, which focus on security aspects like intrusion detection, access control, or recovery from attacks, directly address this issue as it is unrelated to security concerns and instead pertains to functional updates and dependency management."
5,deployability,"* Improved the DeepTrio PacBio models on PacBio Sequel II Chemistry v2.2 by including this data in the training dataset. * Improved `call_variants` speed for PacBio models (both DeepVariant and DeepTrio) by reducing the default window width from 221 to 199, without tradeoff on accuracy. Thanks to @lucasbrambrink for conducting the experiments to find a better window width for PacBio. * Introduced a new flag `--normalize_reads` in `make_examples`, which normalizes Indel candidates at the reads level.This flag is useful to reduce rare cases where an indel variant is not left-normalized. This feature is mainly relevant to joint calling of large cohorts for joint calling, or cases where read mappings have been surjected from one reference to another. It is currently set to False by default. To enable it, add `--normalize_reads=true` directly to the `make_examples` binary. If you’re using the `run_deepvariant` one-step approach, add `--make_examples_extra_args=""normalize_reads=true""`. Currently we don’t recommend turning this flag on for long reads due to potential runtime increase. * Added an `--aux_fields_to_keep` flag to the `make_examples` step, and set the default to only the auxiliary fields that DeepVariant currently uses. This reduces memory use for input BAM files that have large auxiliary fields that aren’t used in variant calling. Thanks to @williamrowell and @rhallPB for reporting this issue. * Reduced the frequency of logging in `make_examples` as well as `call_variants` to address the issue reported in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/491.","

""* Improved the DeepTrio PacBio models on PacBio Sequel II Chemistry v2.2 by including this data in the training dataset. * Improved `call_variants` speed for PacBio models (both DeepVariant and DeepTrio) by reducing the default window width from 221 to 199, without tradeoff on accuracy. Thanks to @lucasbrambrink for conducting the experiments to find a better window width for PacBio. * Introduced a new flag `--normalize_reads` in `make_examples`, which normalizes Indel candidates at the reads level.This flag is useful to reduce rare cases where an indel variant is not left-normalized. This feature is mainly relevant to joint calling of large cohorts for joint calling, or cases where read mappings have been surjected from one reference to another. It is currently set to False by default. To enable it, add `--normalize_reads=true` directly to the `make_examples` binary. If you’re using the `run_deepvariant` one-step approach, add `--make_examples_extra_args=""normalize_reads=true""`. Currently we don’t recommend turning this flag on for long reads due to potential runtime increase. * Added an `--aux_fields_to_keep` flag to the `make_examples` step, and set the default to only the auxiliary fields that DeepVariant currently uses. This reduces memory use for input BAM files that have large auxiliary fields that aren’t used in variant calling. Thanks to @williamrowell and @rhallPB for reporting this issue. * Reduced the frequency of logging in `make_examples` as well as `call_variants` to address the issue reported in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/491.""
","The text describes improvements made to a software system, including improving PacBio models by adjusting window width for better performance and adding new features like normalization flags and logging optimization.",Improved performance of the model by optimizing parameters (window width) and reducing resource usage through configuration changes.,"The improvements include parameter binding at different times to reduce dependencies, improve maintainability, and optimize resource usage. Specifically, `--normalize_reads` flag for normalization at deployment time or build time, and `--aux_fields_to_keep` default reduction reduces coupling by limiting access to only necessary data.",Configuration-time Binding,"The tactics mentioned include binding values (like flags) during configuration or initialization which can be seen as a form of Configuration Parameterization, fitting the 'Binding' category."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes a matrix for testing nmslib installation across various environments and Python versions, with different methods provided based on platform compatibility.",The core problem is ensuring reliable installation of nmslib in diverse environments without changing the codebase. The goal was to provide environment-specific instructions while keeping the main logic intact.,"For each tactic, I will analyze if it addresses the architectural trigger:

- Split Module: This tactic involves dividing a module into smaller ones for better maintainability and change management. However, in this text there is no mention of modifying code structure or splitting modules; instead, environment-specific solutions are provided without altering the core installation process.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Increase Semantic Coherence: Focuses on grouping related functionalities to reduce side effects. The matrix does not show any refactoring or reorganization efforts but rather provides different ways to install depending on conditions. This doesn't directly address increasing coherence in code structure.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Encapsulate: Introduces an interface to limit dependencies and changes impact. In the text, there is no explicit interface creation for installation; it's more about providing various methods based on environment.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Use an Intermediary: Breaks direct dependency between components using a mediator. The matrix doesn't introduce any intermediary component but rather lists different ways to install without changing the core logic.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Restrict Dependencies: Controls which modules interact with others through visibility or authorization. There is no mention of restricting dependencies in this text; instead, multiple methods are provided for installation based on environment.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Refactor: Assigns common responsibilities to a better place to reduce duplication. The matrix does not show any code refactoring but rather different installation approaches without reorganizing the codebase.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Abstract Common Services: Creates an abstract form for similar services to reduce modification costs. This text is about providing environment-specific solutions, not creating abstractions in the service layer.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Component Replacement: Binds values at compile time or build time through replacement mechanisms like build scripts. The matrix provides installation methods but doesn't involve replacing components during binding; it's more about configuration and runtime choices.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Compile-time Parameterization: Binds values at compile time by parameterizing the code. This text does not mention any compile-time adjustments or parameterizations for environment-specific bindings.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Aspects: Uses aspects to bind values, typically cross-cutting concerns. The matrix doesn't deal with aspect-oriented programming but rather provides different installation methods based on conditions.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Configuration-time Binding: Binds values at deployment time through configuration files or settings. This text mentions various ways to install nmslib including using resource files (like Conda environments) and other commands, which could be considered as binding during setup but not necessarily at configuration time in the architectural sense.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Resource Files: Binds values by loading from external resources like files. The text does mention setting up virtual environments with Mamba or using specific resource methods (like Conda), but these are more about dependency management than binding through resource files for services.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Runtime Registration: Binds values at runtime via registration mechanisms. This matrix provides different installation commands based on environment, which is done before runtime and not dynamically during execution. It's static configuration rather than dynamic binding.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Dynamic Lookup: Binds values through runtime lookup of services or dependencies. The text doesn't describe any dynamic service discovery but rather pre-configured methods for installation.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Interpret Parameters: Binds values by interpreting parameters at runtime. This is not evident in the matrix; it's about providing fixed instructions based on environment, without parameter interpretation during execution.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Startup Time Binding: Binds values when the system starts up. The text mentions activating environments and using commands like `mamba create` which are done at startup or initialization time for setting up the environment, but not specifically for service binding.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Name Servers: Uses name servers to bind services dynamically. This is irrelevant as there's no mention of network-based service discovery in this context.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Plug-ins: Binds values at runtime through plug-in mechanisms, allowing interchangeable components. The matrix doesn't involve any plugin system for installation; it's about direct installation methods based on environment conditions.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Publish-Subscribe: Binds values using pub-sub patterns, which is more about communication between modules than configuration binding. Not applicable here.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Shared Repositories: Binds values through shared repositories at runtime. This text doesn't mention sharing any repository for installation purposes; it's self-contained instructions per environment.
  Conclusion: No Match

- Polymorphism: Binds values using polymorphic behavior, allowing different implementations to be used interchangeably. The matrix is about providing specific solutions based on environment (like Windows vs WSL), but without changing the core code structure or interface through inheritance or interfaces; it's more about conditional compilation and configuration.
  Conclusion: No Match",None,"The architectural trigger involves ensuring reliable installation across diverse environments, which is addressed by providing environment-specific instructions. However, none of the available tactics directly match this scenario as they are all focused on code structure or service binding mechanisms rather than deployment configuration."

","The text describes pinning a specific module (scispacy) to an older version due to compatibility issues, while waiting for updated versions that will support newer dependencies.",The core problem is ensuring compatibility between the current system components and future updates by temporarily fixing a dependency version.,"For each tactic in the list: Split Module - No Match (the text does not indicate splitting modules, but rather maintaining an existing module). Increase Semantic Coherence - No Match (no mention of moving responsibilities or reducing side effects). Encapsulate - No Match (there is no explicit interface introduced to reduce propagation). Use an Intermediary - No Match (not using any intermediary to break dependencies). Restrict Dependencies - No Match (the text does not show restricting interactions, but rather pinning a version which might be seen as indirect restriction). Refactor - No Match (no refactoring or factoring out common services is mentioned). Abstract Common Services - No Match (there is no mention of abstracting services to reduce modification costs). Component Replacement - No Match (the text does not describe replacing components, but rather pinning a version which might be considered as part of build configuration). Compile-time Parameterization - No Match (pinning is done at deployment time or via scripts, not compile time). Aspects - No Match (aspects are not mentioned and the issue is about dependency management). Configuration-time Binding - This tactic involves binding values during deployment. The text mentions pinning until models can be upgraded, which could align with configuration-time binding if it's done through config files. However, the example uses a command like 'pip install scispacy==2.1.x' or similar build script, so it might lean towards compile-time parameterization but is not explicitly one of those. Since pinning typically happens at deployment time (e.g., via requirements.txt) and can be considered configuration-time binding, there's a potential match here if we consider the tactic definition for Configuration-time Binding: 'Binding values at deployment time through configuration.' The text says 'until we can upgrade', which implies it's done during setup or deployment. But note that pinning is often done via build tools (like pip) and might be considered part of compile-time parameterization in some contexts, but the tactic definitions differentiate by timing: Configuration-time Binding vs Compile-time Parameterization. The text does not specify if this is done at configuration time (e.g., config file) or compile time (build script). However, pinning a package version can be seen as binding via configuration during deployment setup. But let's check the definition again for Configuration-time Binding: 'Binding values at deployment time through configuration.' This seems to fit because it's being done until models are upgraded, which is part of the system's evolution and likely considered deployment-related. Similarly, Compile-time Parameterization might be if we use build scripts or makefiles to pin versions. The text does not specify the method, but says 'pin scispacy' - this could be via a requirements file (configuration) or via build tools (compile time). Since the tactic definitions are distinct and the trigger is about binding values at deployment time for compatibility, Configuration-time Binding might be the closest if we assume it's done through config. But note: The text says 'Pin scispacy to 2.1.x' - this action can be performed during installation (which could be considered compile-time or configuration-time depending on context). However, in software architecture terms, pinning a dependency version is often a form of binding that occurs at deployment time if it's specified in the setup process. But let's see: The tactic 'Configuration-time Binding' specifically says 'Binding values at deployment time through configuration.' This implies using config files or similar during deployment. Similarly, Compile-time Parameterization uses build scripts to set parameters. Since the text does not specify and we must base on provided tactics only, I will consider both but note that pinning is typically done via a package manager's command-line (like pip) which might be considered configuration at deployment time. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. But for now, let's proceed with the evaluation.",None,"The text describes pinning a dependency version due to compatibility issues until models are upgraded, but none of the available tactics directly address this architectural trigger without additional context or specific application."

By just looking at the number of variants, deepvariant calls 10x more variants for chromosome 1 than GATK (see attached) when filtering for PASS. ![deepvariantvgatk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45370974/79917221-13784a80-83f8-11ea-93c3-8ccc972aeb62.png). I have tried to see if setting a GQ filter would improve the overlap and it does not. I am wondering if this is an issue because I am trying to call germline variants from normal bams (not tumor bams). I also have the command that I used to run deepvariant below. Is there a flag I may be missing? singularity run --nv deepvariant_0.10.0-gpu.sif /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant --model_type=WGS --ref=$ref --reads=$bam --regions $chr --output_vcf=$x.$chr.vcf.gz --intermediate_results_dir /tmp/$USER/$SLURM_JOB_ID/$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID --output_gvcf=$x.$chr.g.vcf.gz --num_shards=3. Also as a follow-up question, what is the gold standard way to call germline vs somatic variants? I can't seem to find the documentation on how to include the matched normal for somatic variant calling. Thanks again for the help.""

","The text describes changes made to a system involving knowledge bases (KBs) and entity linking. Key modifications include renaming `UmlsEntity` to `Entity`, making an argument optional, abstracting a class, refactoring linker paths into a namedtuple, and adding support for additional linkers.",The core problem is the need to make the system more modular and flexible by allowing easier loading of different knowledge bases (KBs) without changing the core logic. The goal was to reduce coupling between components and improve maintainability by refactoring parts related to entity linking and KB handling.,"For each tactic, analyze if it addresses the architectural trigger:

- Split Module: No Match - The text does not describe splitting a module into smaller ones.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No Match - There is no mention of moving unrelated responsibilities to different modules or reducing side effects through better coherence.
- Encapsulate: No Match - Although an interface might be implied, the text doesn't explicitly introduce one for decoupling changes.
- Use an Intermediary: No Match - The changes don't involve breaking dependencies with a new intermediary component.
- Restrict Dependencies: No Match - There is no indication of restricting which modules interact or depend on others.
- Refactor: Match - This tactic involves restructuring code to improve clarity and maintainability, which aligns with the text's description of refactoring linker paths and other components.
- Abstract Common Services: Match - The abstracting of `UmlsKnowledgeBase` into a more general form (`KnowledgeBase`) reduces modification costs by providing a common interface for different KB types.
- Component Replacement: No Match - Binding values at build time is not the focus; the changes are about runtime flexibility and reducing coupling, not replacing components with others.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No Match - The text does not mention binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- Aspects**: No Match - There's no use of aspects for cross-cutting concerns or compile-time binding in this context.
- Configuration-time Binding: No Match - While configuration might be involved, the changes are about runtime and build-time adjustments rather than explicit deployment-time binding.
- Resource Files: No Match - The text doesn't mention using resource files to bind values at startup time.
- Runtime Registration: No Match - Although some bindings happen at runtime, there's no registration mechanism described in the text.
- Dynamic Lookup: No Match - There is no dynamic lookup for services mentioned; the changes are about static refactoring and abstraction.
- Interpret Parameters: No Match - The tactic involves binding values by interpreting parameters, but the text doesn't describe this method explicitly.
- Startup Time Binding: No Match - This would involve loading configurations at startup, which isn't detailed in the text's changes.
- Name Servers: No Match - There is no mention of using name servers for runtime binding.
- Plug-ins: No (Match) - The text mentions adding support for other KBs and linkers but doesn't describe a plug-in mechanism with dynamic loading at runtime.
- Publish-Subscribe: No Match - This pattern isn't relevant to the changes described, which are about refactoring and abstraction of specific components.
- Shared Repositories: No Match - The text does not indicate sharing repositories for binding values.
- Polymorphism: Match - By abstracting `UmlsKnowledgeBase` into a general `KnowledgeBase`, the system can treat different KB types polymorphically, allowing runtime flexibility without changing core logic.",Abstract Common Services,"The tactic 'Abstract Common Services' directly addresses the architectural trigger by creating an abstract base for knowledge bases (KBs), enabling the system to handle various KB types at runtime without modifying the core logic, as seen in the text's description of refactoring and reducing modification costs."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

Additional detail for improvements in DeepVariant v1.2:. Improvements for training:. * We augmented the training data for Illumina WGS model by adding BAMs with trimmed reads (125bps and 100bps) to improve our model’s robustness on different read lengths. Improvements for `make_examples`:. For more details on flags, run `/opt/deepvariant/bin/make_examples --help` for more details. * Major refactoring to ensure useful features (such as --add_hp_channel) can be shared between DeepVariant and DeepTrio make_examples. * Add MED_DP (median of DP) in the gVCF output. See [this section](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-gvcf-support.md#new-option-to-include-med-dp) for more details. * New `--split_skip_reads` flag: if True, make_examples will split reads with large SKIP cigar operations into individual reads. Resulting read parts that are less than 15 bp are filtered out. * We now sort the realigned BAM output mentioned in [this section](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/FAQ.md#what-is-the-realigner-and-how-does-it-work) when you use `--emit_realigned_reads=true --realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads` for make_examples. You will still need to run `samtools index` to get the index file, but no longer need to sort the BAM. * Added an experimental prototype for multi-sample make_examples. - This is an experimental prototype for working with multiple samples in DeepVariant, a proof of concept enabled by the refactoring to join together DeepVariant and DeepTrio, generalizing the functionality of make_examples to work with multiple samples. Usage information is in multisample_make_examples.py, but note that this is experimental. * Improved logic for read allele counts calculation for sites with low base quality indels, which resulted in Ind""

""Adding support for different languages on UMLS EntityLinker; UMLS supports different languages besides English, but it seams harder than I expected to add support for that on top of the current UMLS EntityLinker.

""Enhancement: Provide option to modify cache folder for entity linker knowledge base downloads; https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/2290a80cfe0948e48d8ecfbd60064019d57a6874/scispacy/file_cache.py#L16. For Google Colab users, the `Path.home()` location is `/root/`, which is deleted when the runtime is cleared. As runtimes are cleared fairly often, this means re-downloading the KBs. Perhaps there is a way to alter `Path.home` from `pathlib`? Another option is to allow the user to enter a cache folder, which Colab users could set to their Google Drive (fwiw just a regular folder as seen by python within Colab), thus making the download permanent.""
","The text describes an enhancement request for allowing users to modify the cache folder location in entity linker knowledge base downloads. This is motivated by issues with Google Colab's runtime clearing, which resets `/root/` and causes frequent re-downloads.","The core problem is that the default cache folder (`Path.home()`) on Google Colab is ephemeral (deleted when runtime clears), leading to inefficient re-downloading of knowledge bases. The goal is to provide a persistent storage option for users, specifically allowing them to set it to Google Drive.","The available tactics are grouped into three categories: Detect Faults, Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair, and Prevent Faults.

For **Detect Faults**:
- Ping/Echo: No mention of reachability checks or asynchronous requests for fault detection. The text is about changing the cache location to avoid a problem, not detecting it.
- Monitor: Not mentioned; no component monitoring health here.
- Heartbeat: Periodic message exchange isn't discussed in this context.
- Timestamp: Event sequencing with local clocks isn't relevant.
- Sanity Checking: No validity checks of operations or outputs are proposed.
- Condition Monitoring: The text doesn't involve checking conditions to prevent faults; it's about changing the behavior.
- Exception Detection: While there is a fault (re-downloads), no mechanism for detecting exceptions in this cache issue is described. This tactic focuses on detection, not prevention.
- Self-Test: No self-testing of components mentioned.

For **Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair**:
- Active Redundancy: Not applicable; the system isn't using redundant nodes or parallel processing for identical inputs.
- Passive Redundancy: Doesn't fit as there's no active/passive setup with state updates. The issue is about persistence, not redundancy.
- Spare: Cold sparing isn't relevant here since we're not dealing with fail-over but rather preventing the need to re-download by using a different location.
- Exception Handling: This involves handling exceptions once detected, but the text doesn't describe any mechanism for handling; it's focused on prevention before download failure occurs.
- Rollback: Reverting to previous state isn't mentioned or relevant. The issue is about changing storage location, not rolling back downloads.
- Software Upgrade: Not related to fixing this cache persistence problem.
- Retry: While there might be a transient fault (runtime clearing), the text doesn't suggest retrying operations but rather preventing the need for re-downloads by using persistent storage.
- Ignore Faulty Behavior: This is about ignoring messages from faulty sources, not relevant here.
- Degradation: Dropping less critical functions isn't addressed; this is a feature request to improve persistence.
- Reconfiguration: The text suggests allowing users to change the cache folder location (a configuration change) which could be seen as reconfiguring the system. However, it's more about user-configurable prevention than automatic recovery from faults.",None,"The requested enhancement is about providing a configurable option for persistent storage to avoid frequent re-downloads in Google Colab environments. None of the provided tactics directly address this specific issue of preventing data loss due to ephemeral runtime, as they focus on fault detection, recovery mechanisms (redundancy or reintroduction), or exception handling rather than user-configurable prevention."

","The text describes a change involving binding values at different times, specifically during startup or initialization.",The core problem was to bind configuration-dependent services dynamically without modifying code for each new service added.,"Refactor: This tactic involves factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home. The text mentions moving the binding of values at different times, which aligns with refactoring by removing duplication or improving structure to reduce modification costs. Match.

Abstract Common Services: Implementing similar services once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs. This tactic is about abstracting common services for reuse and reducing modification costs. The text doesn't mention any common service abstraction, so it does not directly address the trigger of binding values at different times. No Match.

Component Replacement: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in scripts. The text involves runtime binding, which is a form of deferred binding but not necessarily component replacement as defined. No Match.

Increase Semantic Coherence: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce side effects. This tactic focuses on reducing side effects by improving module structure and cohesion. The text doesn't mention moving responsibilities or reducing side effects, so it does not directly address this trigger for binding values at specific times. No Match.

Polymorphism: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism. Polymorphism allows different implementations to be used interchangeably without changing the code that uses them. This tactic is about using inheritance and interfaces to bind services dynamically based on type, which aligns with the text's description of binding values (like configuration or startup) but not necessarily through parameterization or specific mechanisms mentioned in the trigger analysis.

Startup Time Binding: Binding values at runtime during startup.",None,"The selected tactic should be one that directly addresses the architectural trigger, which is to bind values dynamically without changing core logic.

","The text describes a new feature for automatic acquisition of hyponyms from large text corpora using SpaCy Matcher, with an option for extended patterns affecting recall and precision. It also mentions bug fixes related to entity linkers reducing aliases in UMLS and fixing file paths.","The core problem is the implementation of a new feature (automatic acquisition of hyponyms) that requires integration with existing SpaCy components, along with addressing inconsistencies in data formats for different corpora through bug fixes.","For each tactic, I will analyze if it directly addresses the architectural trigger.

- Split Module: This is about refining modules into smaller ones. In this text, no such splitting or refinement of existing code is mentioned; instead, there's an addition of a component (HyponymDetector) which might be considered as extending the system rather than refactoring it further. However, without explicit mention of module splitting, I cannot conclude that Split Module was used.

- Increase Semantic Coherence: This tactic involves moving responsibilities to different modules for better side-effect reduction. The text does not describe any such restructuring or separation of concerns; instead, a new component is added and existing ones are fixed (like the entity linkers). No match.

- Encapsulate: Introduces an explicit interface to reduce change propagation. In this case, adding a pipeline component (`HyponymDetector`) might involve some encapsulation if it has its own interface, but there's no explicit mention of interfaces being introduced or changed in the text. The bug fixes are about reducing aliases and fixing paths, which don't directly relate to encapsulation.

- Use an Intermediary: Breaks dependencies by using an intermediary. Here, `HyponymDetector` is added as a pipeline component that uses SpaCy's existing mechanisms (like Matcher). It doesn't break any direct dependency but rather builds upon the existing framework. No match.

- Restrict Dependencies: Controls which modules interact. The text mentions fixing file paths for entity linkers and normalizing data formats, but nothing about restricting dependencies between modules.

- Refactor: Factoring out common responsibilities to reduce duplication. The bug fix (252) removes duplicated aliases in the entity linkers, so this tactic is applied here by reducing code duplication through refactoring.

- Abstract Common Services: Creating a general form for similar services. No mention of abstracting or creating an abstract service; instead, specific functionalities are implemented and fixed.

- Component Replacement: Binding values at compile time via build scripts.

By compatible here we. mean the BAM and FASTA share at least a reasonable set of common contigs, as. DeepVariant will only process contigs shared by both the BAM and reference. As. an example, suppose you have a BAM file mapped to b37 + decoy FASTA and you. provide just the vanilla b37 fasta to `make_examples`. DeepVariant will only. process variants on the shared contigs, effectively excluding the hs37d5 contig. present in the BAM but not in the reference. The BAM file must be also sorted and indexed. It must exist on disk, so you. cannot pipe it into DeepVariant. Duplicate marking may be performed, in our. analyses there is almost no difference in accuracy except at lower (<20x). coverages. Finally, we recommend that you do not perform BQSR. Running BQSR has. a small decrease on accuracy.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

"" Advanced Case Study: Train a customized SNP and small indel variant caller for BGISEQ-500 data. DeepVariant is an analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call. genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. While. DeepVariant is highly accurate for. [many types of NGS data](https://rdcu.be/7Dhl), some users may be interested in. training custom deep learning models that have been optimized for very specific. data. This case study describes one way to train such a custom model using a GPU, in. this case for BGISEQ-500 data. Please note that there is not yet a production-grade training pipeline. This is. just one example of how to train a custom model, and is neither the fastest nor. the cheapest possible configuration. The resulting model also does not represent. the greatest achievable accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data. High level summary of result. We demonstrated that by training on 1 replicate of BGISEQ-500 whole genome data. (everything except for chromosome 20-22), we can significantly improve the. accuracy comparing to the WGS model as a baseline:. * Indel F1 `94.1615%` --> `98.1937%`. * SNP F1: `99.8785%` --> `99.9042%`. This tutorial is meant as an example for training; all the other processing in. this tutorial were done serially with no pipeline optimization. Request a machine.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes how to install and use scispaCy for natural language processing tasks, including various installation methods (pip, Mamba), setting up a Conda environment, activating it, loading models, and mentions about upgrading.",The core problem is the need to manage different installation methods and configurations for `scispacy` without changing the main code logic. The goal was to provide flexible ways to install dependencies based on user requirements or system constraints.,"For each tactic, I will analyze if it directly addresses the architectural trigger of managing multiple installation methods and configurations flexibly:
- Split Module: No match. The text doesn't describe splitting a module for this purpose.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: No match. There's no mention of moving responsibilities or reducing side effects from unclear dependencies.
- Encapsulate: No match. Although an interface is mentioned (e.g., `spacy.load`), it isn't introduced to reduce propagation, and the focus is on installation methods.
- Use an Intermediary: No match. The text doesn't break a dependency between responsibilities using an intermediary; instead, it uses direct commands or tools like Mamba.
- Restrict Dependencies: No match. There's no restriction of modules that `scispacy` interacts with mentioned in the context of installation flexibility.
- Refactor: No match. While there might be code improvements elsewhere, this text is about installation and doesn't factor out common services or responsibilities for better cohesion.
- Abstract Common Services: No match. The text describes specific commands but not an abstract service that can handle different bindings at runtime.
- Component Replacement: Match. This tactic involves binding values (like dependencies) by replacing components during setup, which aligns with the installation methods mentioned in the text where users choose from various ways to install `scispacy` or its dependencies.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No match. The text doesn't mention parameterizing at compile time; all bindings are done via commands or scripts that can be run dynamically.
- Aspects: No match. There's no use of aspects (like compile-time binding with aspect-oriented programming) in the described installation process.
- Configuration-time Binding: Match. This tactic binds values during deployment, which could include setting up environments before running the code. The text mentions installing via pip or other methods at configuration time, such as using `CFLAGS` or specifying models to install.
- Resource Files: No match. Although resource files might be used for configurations elsewhere, this text doesn't mention them in relation to installation bindings.
- Runtime Registration: Match. This tactic binds values during runtime by registering them dynamically. The text mentions installing via pip with verbose options and upgrading `pybind11`, which can be done at runtime or through commands that are executed when needed (e.g., after environment setup).
- Dynamic Lookup: No match. There's no mention of looking up services at runtime without explicit binding; the bindings are direct installation methods.
- Interpret Parameters: Match. This tactic involves binding values by interpreting parameters at runtime, which is seen in commands like `pip install --no-binary :all:` or specifying models via command line during installation.
- Startup Time Binding: No match. The text doesn't explicitly bind dependencies at startup time; the bindings are done through installation steps that precede running the code.
- Name Servers: No match. There's no use of name servers for binding values in this context.
- Plug-ins: Match. This tactic allows adding functionality at runtime without changing core logic, which is somewhat reflected in the ability to install different models or versions via specific commands (like `git+https`), but it's not a plug-in system per se; more of an installation method.
- Publish-Subscribe: No match. The text doesn't describe any messaging pattern for binding values.
- Shared Repositories: Match. This tactic binds values through shared repositories, which could be interpreted as the GitHub repository being used to install `nmslib` via a specific URL (e.g., `git+https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib.git`). However, this is more about dependency management than runtime binding.
- Polymorphism: No match. There's no mention of polymorphic behavior in the installation or usage context.",Component Replacement,"The selected tactic 'Component Replacement' directly addresses the architectural trigger by allowing users to bind different versions and configurations (like using Mamba) at compile time or build time, which aligns with the text's description of various installation methods that can be chosen without altering the core `scispacy` logic."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""Specialized instantiation for string fields, which require different memory management and semantics.""
","The text describes a need to handle specialized cases of field instantiations differently, specifically mentioning that string fields have unique requirements regarding memory management and semantics.",The core problem is the need to manage different behaviors for specific types of fields (like strings) without affecting other field types. The goal appears to be reducing complexity or avoiding errors by tailoring the instantiation process according to type-specific needs.,"I'll evaluate each tactic against this trigger:

- Split Module: Does not directly address specialized behavior for specific data types.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: This might help if we reorganize modules, but the text doesn't mention refactoring or moving responsibilities.
- Encapsulate: Focuses on interfaces and reducing propagation of changes; no direct link to type-specific instantiation.
- Use an Intermediary: Could be used for dependency breaking, but not specifically mentioned in the context of specialized instantiations.
- Restrict Dependencies: Not relevant as it's about limiting interactions, not handling special cases.
- Refactor: The text mentions specialization which might imply refactoring to handle specific types differently, so this could match if we interpret 'tailoring' as part of refactor.
- Abstract Common Services: This is for generalizing services; the trigger involves specialization, so it doesn't directly apply.
- Component Replacement: Involves replacing components at build time; not about runtime or specialized behavior.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Binds values at compile time; no mention of parameterization in this text.
- Aspects**: Aspect-oriented programming might help with cross-cutting concerns, but the trigger is about specialized instantiation for specific types, which isn't a typical aspect use case.
- Configuration-time Binding: Not directly related to runtime or specialized behavior.
- Resource Files: Used for binding values at startup; not specifically tied to type-based specialization.
- Runtime Registration: Binds services at runtime through registration; could be relevant if we register different behaviors based on field types, but the text doesn't mention this.
- Dynamic Lookup**: Involves looking up services at runtime; might help in finding appropriate instantiation for a given type, so it could match.
- Interpret Parameters: This tactic involves binding values by interpreting parameters at runtime. The trigger mentions specialized instantiation which may involve different parameter interpretations or handling based on the field's type (e.g., string vs other). So this could be relevant.
- Startup Time Binding: Similar to Resource Files, but not directly tied to specialization.
- Name Servers**: Not mentioned in the text and doesn't seem central to the problem described.
- Plug-ins: Allows adding functionality at runtime; if we consider different instantiation methods as plug-in components for specific field types, this could match. The trigger mentions specialized handling which aligns with having tailored plug-in behaviors.
- Publish-Subscribe: This is about decoupling publishers and subscribers; not directly related to specialized instantiation of fields.
- Shared Repositories: Involves sharing data or services at runtime; the text doesn't mention shared repositories for this purpose.
- Polymorphism**: The trigger mentions different memory management and semantics for string fields, which could be addressed by having a polymorphic structure where each field type has its own implementation. This would allow specialized behavior without changing core logic.",Polymorphism,"The selected tactic is Polymorphism because the text describes handling different behaviors (like memory management) for specific types of fields, which can be directly addressed by having a base class or interface with type-specific implementations that override common methods."

- Split Module: This is about breaking down modules, not relevant to installation instructions.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: Focuses on improving module design internally, not applicable here.
- Encapsulate: Involves creating interfaces for better encapsulation, unrelated to this text.
- Use an Intermediary: About managing dependencies between components via intermediaries, but the text is about installation steps.

- Refactor: Involves restructuring code internally for better design, doesn't apply to this installation guide.
- Abstract Common Services: Again, about designing abstract services in code, not related to the given text.
- Component Replacement: This tactic involves replacing components at build time. The text describes an installation process which is more like configuration and execution steps than component replacement.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Involves binding values during compilation; the text's instructions are about runtime actions (installation commands).
- Aspects: A cross-cutting concern in code design, not applicable here.
- Configuration-time Binding: This involves setting up bindings at deployment time. The installation steps described might be considered as part of setup or configuration before use, but they don't directly match the definition which is about binding values during deployment for software functionality.
- Resource Files: Typically used in code to store data externally; not relevant to this text.
- Runtime Registration: Involves dynamic registration at runtime. The installation commands are executed once and then the system runs normally, so it's more static than dynamic.
- Dynamic Lookup: About runtime services discovery via lookup mechanisms; doesn't fit with a one-time installation process.
- Interpret Parameters: Binding values by interpreting parameters during execution; not applicable here as there is no parameter interpretation in the instructions.
- Startup Time Binding: Involves binding at startup time. The text's steps include creating an environment and running commands, which might be considered part of setup before actual application startup.
- Name Servers: Used for runtime service discovery via name servers; not related to installation.
- Plug-ins: For extending functionality at runtime through plug-in mechanisms; irrelevant here.
- Publish-Subscribe: A messaging pattern for decoupling components; doesn't apply.
- Shared Repositories: Involves using shared data stores or repositories during runtime; not relevant.
- Polymorphism: About runtime binding of different implementations to a common interface.

I know Deepvariant works well in human and in some species like rice, if I recall well. In short, all species with (very) low heterozygousity. I wonder if you see a use for Deepvariant in other species, like, there are marine species that are so ancient, diverse, widespread, you can have 5% heterozygosity, in shorts, SNPs everywhere. In such cases, Deepvariant has a tendency to ditch apparently at random (Sample1 Chrom3:20456 called, Sample2 same position not called, despite obvious evidence from mapping and support from long reads). Probably because it didn't learn what to do with so many SNPs. You know the issue because of your mosquito blog spot. And I have seen other issues (including mine) talking about that. The issue is to have a gold standard like in human, or trio data like in the mosquito, you need specific conditions, it seems difficult to imagine this could be doable with, let's say, a deep sea coral (just random example, I don't actually know what's their genome like). . Could a synthetic dataset help here? What if we feed Deepvariant a genome we made up based on what we can observed visually? I am aware if we make an error it will learn errors, but I wanted your opinion, because the lack of high quality reference dataset for many species, seems to be a serious limitation for this kind of program.

""How do you see the future of CNN outside of human genomics?; Hello,. some of you might remember me. I know Deepvariant works well in human and in some species like rice, if I recall well. In short, all species with (very) low heterozygousity. I wonder if you see a use for Deepvariant in other species, like, there are marine species that are so ancient, diverse, widespread, you can have 5% heterozygosity, in shorts, SNPs everywhere. In such cases, Deepvariant has a tendency to ditch apparently at random (Sample1 Chrom3:20456 called, Sample2 same position not called, despite obvious evidence from mapping and support from long reads). Probably because it didn't learn what to do with so many SNPs. You know the issue because of your mosquito blog spot. And I have seen other issues (including mine) talking about that. The issue is to have a gold standard like in human, or trio data like in the mosquito, you need specific conditions, it seems difficult to imagine this could be doable with, let's say, a deep sea coral (just random example, I don't actually know what's their genome like). . Could a synthetic dataset help here? What if we feed Deepvariant a genome we made up based on what we can observed visually? I am aware if we make an error it will learn errors, but I wanted your opinion, because the lack of high quality reference dataset for many species, seems to be a serious limitation for this kind of program. Thanks a lot. Since it's not the first time I bring this out, I understand if you would simply close this. Have a good week everyone.""

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

",The text describes a method for caching spaCy NLP models based on their creation options to prevent repeated loading.,"The core problem is inefficient resource usage due to repeated loading of the same spaCy model, and the goal is to reduce this overhead by reusing loaded instances.","Control Resource Demand: Manage Sampling Rate - No Match. Limit Event Response - No Match. Prioritize Events - No Match. Reduce Overhead - This tactic directly addresses reducing resources consumed in processing an event stream by caching model references, thus matching the trigger.
Bound Execution Times - Not applicable as it's about execution time limits, not relevant here.
Increase Resource Efficiency: Increase Resource Efficiency - Yes, this matches because improving algorithms to decrease latency aligns with reusing models. However, note that 'Increase Resources' is a different tactic and should be considered separately.

Manage Resources: Increase Resources - No Match (this would add more resources, not reuse existing ones).
Introduce Concurrency - Not relevant as the text doesn't mention parallel processing.
Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations - This involves having multiple replicas for computation, but here we're caching a single model reference; however, it might be considered if interpreted broadly, but note that 'Maintain Multiple Copies' typically means redundancy for fault tolerance or scaling, not just caching one instance. The text is about saving references to avoid loading the same model again, which is more like reducing overhead by avoiding recomputation/loading.

Bound Queue Sizes - Not relevant as it's about event queues and resource control in scheduling.
Schedule Resources - Not directly addressed; this tactic focuses on compatible scheduling strategies for resources.",Reduce Overhead,"The selected tactic 'Reduce Overhead' solves the architectural trigger by caching model references to avoid repeated loading, thereby reducing the computational overhead associated with each event or request that would otherwise require reloading."

The goal was to reduce the overhead associated with multiple loadings by ensuring each configuration is loaded only once.,"For Split Module: No, as there's no indication that a module needs splitting.
For Increase Semantic Coherence: No, since the text doesn't mention moving unrelated responsibilities.
For Encapsulate: No, because an interface isn't introduced to limit dependencies.
For Use an Intermediary: No, as no intermediary is used between components.
For Restrict Dependencies: No, there's no restriction on which modules interact with each other.
For Refactor: No, the text doesn't describe factoring out common services or responsibilities from multiple modules.
For Abstract Common Services: No, because it mentions caching references but not creating an abstract service layer.

For Component Replacement: No, as there's no build script replacement mentioned.
For Compile-time Parameterization: No, since binding happens at runtime based on options.
For Aspects: No, aspects aren't used for this purpose in the text.
For Configuration-time Binding: No, because configuration isn't involved; it's about caching during initialization or startup.

For Runtime Registration: The tactic involves binding values (like services) at runtime through registration. In the text, references are saved based on options to avoid repeated loading, which is a form of binding but not explicitly via registration. However, this could be seen as similar if we consider that caching is done by registering or storing configurations.

For Dynamic Lookup: This tactic involves looking up services at runtime. The text doesn't mention dynamic lookup; it's about static caching based on options.

For Interpret Parameters: Binding values by interpreting parameters at runtime. In the text, binding happens through keying references with options used to create them, which is a form of parameter-based binding but not necessarily interpreted in real-time.

For Startup Time Binding: This involves loading or initializing services during startup. The text mentions saving references (likely during initialization) so that they can be accessed without reloading later. This fits the description as it binds at startup time to improve performance and reduce redundancy.

For Name Servers: No, name servers aren't mentioned for service binding.
For Plug-ins: No, plug-ins are not involved in this caching mechanism.
For Publish-Subscribe: Not applicable, no messaging pattern is described.
For Shared Repositories: This tactic involves sharing data or services at runtime. The text doesn't mention shared repositories; it's about caching references to avoid reloading the same model configuration.

For Polymorphism: No, polymorphism isn't used for binding values in this context.",Runtime Registration,"The selected tactic 'Runtime Registration' solves the architectural trigger by allowing the system to bind and cache spaCy model references at startup time based on their configuration options, ensuring that each unique configuration is loaded only once and can be retrieved efficiently later."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes a method for upgrading and installing models in scispacy, specifically biomedical data processing models with different sizes and features. It includes instructions on how to download or install from URLs based on model compatibility.","The core problem is ensuring that the correct version of a model is used when upgrading `scispacy`, which requires binding model versions at runtime for compatibility.","For each tactic, I will analyze if it addresses the trigger: The trigger is about binding values (model versions) at runtime to ensure compatibility. Let's evaluate:
- Split Module: This tactic refines modules into smaller ones but doesn't directly address value binding or version compatibility.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: Focuses on moving responsibilities for better cohesion, not specifically on runtime binding of model versions.
- Encapsulate: Introduces an interface to reduce coupling by limiting dependencies. It might help with versioning if done properly, but the text doesn't mention interfaces or encapsulation.
- Use an Intermediary: Breaks direct dependencies using an intermediary. The text uses a URL-based approach which could be seen as an intermediary for model installation, but it's not explicit.
- Restrict Dependencies: Controls what modules interact with by visibility rules. Not directly addressed in the text.
- Refactor: Removes duplication from modules. Doesn't mention version binding or compatibility issues.
- Abstract Common Services: Creates abstract services to reduce modification costs. The models are specific and don't share a common service structure for versions.

Now, looking at Defer Binding tactics:
- Component Replacement: Binds values through build scripts by replacing components. Not applicable here as the binding is done via installation commands or URLs during runtime.
- Compile-time Parameterization: Binds values at compile time. The text doesn't suggest compile-time binding; it's about runtime compatibility.
- Aspects: Binds values using aspects, typically for cross-cutting concerns. Doesn't fit with model versioning.
- Configuration-time Binding: Binds values at deployment time through configuration files or scripts. This could be relevant if the user configures the model during setup, but the text shows runtime binding via pip install from URL.
- Resource Files: Uses resource files for binding at startup. The models are downloaded and then installed, which might involve a resource file step, but it's not clear.
- Startup Time Binding: Binds values during startup by loading configurations or resources. This fits because the user installs the model via pip after downloading or copying the URL, so the version is bound when starting `scispacy`.
- Dynamic Lookup: Finds services at runtime through dynamic mechanisms like service locators. Not directly related to model versions in this text.
- Interpret Parameters: Binds values by interpreting parameters at runtime. The install command uses a parameter (the URL) which might be interpreted, but it's more about direct binding than interpretation for configuration.
- Plug-ins: Loads functionality at runtime through plug-in mechanisms. This could apply if the models are considered plug-ins that can be registered dynamically based on version compatibility.
- Publish-Subscribe: Binds values using pub-sub patterns, which is not relevant here.
- Shared Repositories: Uses shared repositories for binding, but the text doesn't mention sharing or a central repository.
- Polymorphism: Binds types at runtime through polymorphic behavior. The models are different implementations (e.g., en_core_sci_sm vs en_core_sci_md) which could be seen as using polymorphism if they inherit from a common base class, but the text doesn't specify that.",Runtime Registration,The selected tactic of Runtime Registration is directly supported by the text's description of installing models via pip after downloading or copying URLs. This allows for dynamic binding of model versions at runtime based on compatibility requirements.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

","The text discusses adjusting hyperparameters in nmslib to improve recall by setting them to maximum recommended values, specifically mentioning the HNSW graph construction where increasing M improves recall but slows down indexing.",The core problem is that default hyperparameter settings for NMSLIB's HNSW method result in low recall. The goal was to increase recall by adjusting these parameters appropriately.,"For each tactic, analyze if it addresses the trigger:

""Shuffle script for training runs out of memory; **Describe the issue:**. Shuffle script for tfrecords (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.0/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md) runs out of memory when using a training set from multiple BAM files. This is what I followed:. - Run make_examples for each BAM file to obtain tfrecords. - Run shuffle script (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.0/tools/shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py) on all the records from all the BAM files. This requires over 230 GB of CPU RAM, and the process is eventually killed. I do not know whether the memory requirement will keep growing beyond this point.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes a matrix of compatibility issues with installing nmslib, a library used by scispaCy, across different Python versions and operating systems (Windows, WSL, Macs), providing installation methods for each case.",The core problem is the difficulty in installing nmslib due to version-specific dependencies. The goal was to provide an organized way to help users install it successfully in various environments by specifying compatible Python versions and operating systems.,"For each tactic, I will analyze if it directly addresses the architectural trigger (difficulty in installation across different environments). Split Module: This is about reducing module size through decomposition. The text doesn't mention splitting modules; it's focused on compatibility issues during installation. So this does not match.
Increase Semantic Coherence: This involves moving unrelated responsibilities to separate modules for clarity and side-effect reduction. The text is about installation problems, not code structure or cohesion. No match.
Encapsulate: Introduces an interface to limit dependencies propagation. Installation isn't a runtime dependency issue; it's about build-time compatibility across environments. Not directly applicable here. No match.
Use an Intermediary: Breaks direct dependencies with an intermediary. The text doesn't describe using an intermediary for installation; it lists various methods per environment. No match.
Restrict Dependencies: Limits which modules interact, preventing change propagation. This is about code-level restrictions during development or runtime, not build-time compatibility across environments. Not a strong fit. No match.
Refactor: Removes duplication by extracting common services. The text doesn't mention refactoring existing code; it's focused on installation methods for nmslib itself. No match.
Abstract Common Services: Creates an abstract form to reduce modification costs. This is about designing the system, not dealing with external library installation issues. Not applicable here. No match.
Component Replacement: Binds values at compile time via build scripts or makefiles. The text mentions installing in different environments and using tools like Mamba for virtual environments, but it doesn't involve replacing components during binding; it's about specifying the correct method per environment. However, by providing a matrix of methods based on environment, this tactic is somewhat tangentially related to ensuring compatibility through explicit bindings (though not necessarily component replacement). Let's see if there's a better fit.
Compile-time Parameterization: Binds values at compile time via parameters. The text doesn't mention parameterizing the build or using compiler flags for binding in general; it lists specific installation commands per environment, which are more about configuration and runtime decisions. Not directly matching.
Aspects: A way to modularize cross-cutting concerns by applying aspects at compile time. This is not relevant to the installation problem described. No match.
Configuration-time Binding: Binds values during deployment through config files or scripts. The text describes a matrix that helps users choose an installation method based on their environment, which could be seen as configuration-time binding (i.e., setting up the build process). However, it's more about specifying different methods per environment rather than using standard configuration mechanisms. It might fit but not perfectly.
Resource Files: Binds values at startup via resource files. This is for runtime binding, and installation isn't a startup issue unless we consider virtual environments or specific setup scripts. Not directly matching the trigger.
Runtime Registration: Binds values dynamically during execution. Installation issues are about build-time compatibility; this tactic doesn't apply to that context. No match.
Dynamic Lookup: Resolves services at runtime through dynamic mechanisms. Again, not relevant for installation problems which occur before runtime. No match.
Interpret Parameters: Binds values by interpreting parameters at runtime. This is a form of binding but typically used in function calls or service resolution during execution, not for build-time compatibility across environments. Not matching.
Startup Time Binding: Binds values when the system starts up (e.g., via configuration). The text mentions setting up virtual environments and then installing nmslib, which could be considered as part of startup time binding if we think about initializing a project with specific dependencies. But it's more about pre-installation setup than runtime binding.
Name Servers: Used for runtime service discovery. Not applicable to installation issues.
Plug-ins: Binds values at runtime via plug-in mechanisms. Installation is not about loading plugins during execution; it's about getting the library installed in different environments.
Publish-Subscribe: A messaging pattern for decoupling components, but doesn't directly relate to installation problems.
Shared Repositories: Allows multiple modules or systems to access a shared repository at runtime. This might help with dependency management if we consider that nmslib could be stored in a central location, but the text is about installing it locally per environment and not using shared repositories for binding values during setup.
Polymorphism: Binds specific implementations based on type at runtime. Not relevant to build-time installation issues.",None,"The architectural trigger involves difficulties in building or installing a library across different environments, which is not directly addressed by any of the available tactics from the 'Reduce Size', 'Increase Cohesion', or 'Defer Binding' categories. The tactics listed under 'Defer Binding' are primarily about runtime binding and configuration mechanisms that don't align with build-time compatibility issues."

- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.

",The text describes a new feature for automatic acquisition of hyponyms from large text corpora using SpaCy Matcher. It also mentions bug fixes related to entity linkers and dependency labels normalization.,"The core problem is improving the system's ability to handle different data sources or formats, specifically addressing issues with inconsistent corpora dependencies and reducing redundancy in entity linkers.","For Increase semantic coherence: The text does not indicate localizing UI responsibilities. It focuses on functionality and bug fixes for data processing. No Match.

For Encapsulate: Not mentioned; the text is about adding a new component and fixing bugs, no encapsulation discussed. No Match.

Co-locate related responsibilities: The HyponymDetector is added as a pipeline to SpaCy, which might co-locate its functionality with other components, but it's not explicitly stated for this purpose. However, the bug fix about aliases in entity linkers could be seen as encapsulating or co-locating that responsibility within the linker component. Let's analyze: The text says 'removed duplicated aliases' and 'fixing the path to the rxnorm linker'. This seems more like refactoring or dependency management rather than directly addressing a trigger for these tactics. But let's see if it fits any tactic definition.

Restrict dependencies: The bug fix about normalizing dependency labels suggests managing how different corpora interact, which could restrict dependencies between systems or data formats. Also, the removal of duplicated aliases might reduce coupling by making entity linkers more self-contained. This seems relevant to Restrict dependencies as it minimizes ripple effects from changes in one part.

Defer binding: Not mentioned; no indication that critical choices were made without recoding. No Match.

Cancel: The text does not mention user termination or resource management for commands. No Match.

Undo: No feature to restore earlier states at user request. No Match.

Pause/resume: No ability to temporarily free resources mentioned. No Match.

Aggregate: Not relevant; the text is about extracting specific relations, not applying operations to groups of objects. No Match.

Maintain task models: The Onotonotes fix might help in understanding user context better by normalizing data formats, but it's more about system-level adjustments for consistency than explicitly representing user knowledge or providing assistance based on that. Not a strong match.

Maintain user models: This is about the system having an idea of what the user is attempting and controlling responses accordingly. The text does not mention anything related to user state or explicit representation of user knowledge. No Match.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

If the CRAM file uses read sequence compression with an external reference file, and this reference file is no longer accessible in the location specified by the CRAM file's UR tag and cannot be found in the local genome cache, its location must be passed to SamReader via the ref_path parameter: ```python from third_party.nucleus.io import sam cram_path = /path/to/sample.cram ref_path = /path/to/genome.fasta with sam.SamReader(cram_path, ref_path=ref_path) as reader: for read in reader: print(read) ``` Unfortunately, htslib is unable to load the ref_path from anything other than a POSIX filesystem. (htslib plugin filesystems like S3 or GCS buckets won't work). For that reason, we don't recommend the use of CRAM files with external reference files, but instead suggest using read sequence compression with embedded reference data. (This has a minor impact on file size, but significantly improves file access simplicity and safety.) For more information ab""
","The text discusses an issue with reading and writing CRAM files in Python, specifically addressing the handling of external reference paths for compressed reads.",The core problem is that htslib cannot handle external reference files from non-POSIX filesystems like S3 or GCS buckets. The goal was to enable seamless access to CRAM/CRAM files stored in cloud storage without modifying the core logic of reading/writing.,"For each tactic, analyze whether it directly addresses the architectural_trigger: 'The system needed a way to bind values at runtime that are not available at compile time or deployment time due to dynamic nature of data sources.'

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

21,deployability,"Improving pre-built DeepVariant binaries for conda packages; Hi all;. Thanks for all the help getting an initial conda package in place for DeepVariant (#9) through bioconda. I wanted to follow up with some suggestions that would help make the pre-built binaries more portable as part of this process, in order of helpfulness for portability:. - Currently the binaries need a recent kernel with GLIBC > 2.23 due to pre-built htslib and other libraries. Would it be possible to build the DeepVariant libraries on an older machine to allow a wider range of system support? We build on CentOS 6 in conda to provide wider compatibility. - main.py in the zip files hardcodes python to use `/usr/bin/python`. Would it be possible to generalize this by using the python that the zip file gets called with (`sys.executable`)? I currently patch this in the conda build: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/recipes/deepvariant/build.sh#L22. - This is currently built against numpy 1.13 and ideally we'd want to sync with CONDA_NPY (1.12: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/scripts/env_matrix.yml#L9). I believe building against 1.12 would make it forward compatible. An alternative to points 1 and 3 is making it easier to build DeepVariant as part of the conda build process. The major blocker here is the `clif` dependency which is difficult to build and the pre-built binaries require unpacking into `/usr`. If we could make this relocatable and easier to install globally we could build with portable binaries and adjustable numpy as part of the bioconda preparation process. Thanks again for all the help.","

We build on CentOS 6 in conda to provide wider compatibility. - main.py in the zip files hardcodes python to use `/usr/bin/python`. Would it be possible to generalize this by using the python that the zip file gets called with (`sys.executable`)? I currently patch this in the conda build: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/recipes/deepvariant/build.sh#L22. - This is currently built against numpy 1.13 and ideally we'd want to sync with CONDA_NPY (1.12: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/scripts/env_matrix.yml#L9). I believe building against 1.12 would make it forward compatible. An alternative to points 1 and 3 is making it easier to build DeepVariant as part of the conda build process. The major blocker here is the `clif` dependency which is difficult to build and the pre-built binaries require unpacking into `/usr`. If we could make this relocatable and easier to install globally we could build with portable binaries and adjustable numpy as part of the bioconda preparation process. Thanks again for all the help.""

39,energy efficiency,"Custom (local) UMLS subsets; Hi scispacy team,. First of all, thanks for creating a great tool, I think it's very useful! I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**.

The reason I'm asking is twofold:. 1. UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy.

## Relevant Tactic Names for this Quality Attribute
Metering, Static Classification, Dynamic Classification, Vertical Scaling, Horizontal Scaling, Scheduling, Brokering, Service Adaptation, Increase Efficiency, Reduce Overhead

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Resource Monitoring
- **Metering**: Collecting data about the energy consumption of computational devices via a sensor infrastructure in real time.
- **Static Classification**: Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- **Scheduling**: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- **Brokering**: Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.

#### Resource Adaptation
- **Service Adaptation**: Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Co-locating resources and removing intermediaries and abstractions to reduce computational overhead and energy demands.
