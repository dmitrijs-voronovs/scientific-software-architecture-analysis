","The text describes various methods for installing and configuring scispaCy, including pip installations with different flags, using virtual environments like Mamba/Conda, creating specific Python versions, activating the environment, loading models, and noting that upgrades require re-downloading compatible models.",The goal is to provide multiple installation options for a software library (scispaCy) while ensuring compatibility with different system configurations or requirements. This addresses flexibility in deployment methods and dependency management during setup.,"For each tactic, I will analyze its applicability based on the text:

- Split Module: The text is about installation procedures, not code structure. No mention of splitting modules.
No Match.

- Increase Semantic Coherence: Focuses on reducing side effects by grouping related responsibilities. Installation methods are listed but no coherence improvement in code is described.
No Match.

- Encapsulate: Introduces an interface to limit changes propagation. The text mentions using virtual environments and specifying Python versions, which could be seen as encapsulation of dependencies, but it's not explicitly stated for the library itself.
Applicability analysis: Setting up a virtual environment (like Conda) can be considered a form of encapsulation by isolating the module's dependencies from the rest of the system. However, the text doesn't directly describe this tactic being applied to scispaCy code; it's about deployment and configuration.
No Match.

- Use an Intermediary: Breaks direct dependency between components using a third party. The text uses Mamba (a Conda wrapper) as an intermediary for setting up environments, but the primary focus is on installation methods, not necessarily breaking dependencies in code structure.
Applicability analysis: Using Mamba to create and activate environments can be seen as an intermediary step that manages dependencies indirectly. However, it's more about tooling than a direct architectural tactic described.
No Match.

- Restrict Dependencies: Limits which modules interact with others through visibility or authorization. The text mentions creating specific Conda environments (e.g., scispacy) and using virtual environments to manage Python versions, which restricts the environment from affecting other projects. This could be a match if we consider that by specifying dependencies in the environment setup, one is restricting what modules are available.
Applicability analysis: The text says 'Create a Conda environment called scispacy with Python 3.9' and then installs scispaCy into it. This restricts the module's dependencies to this isolated environment, preventing unintended interactions elsewhere. Also, when upgrading, models must be re-downloaded for compatibility.
Match.

- Refactor: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules. The text doesn't describe refactoring code; it's about installation and configuration steps.
No Match.

- Abstract Common Services: Creating a general form to reduce modification costs. No mention of abstracting services in the library itself, only in deployment methods.
No Match.

Defer Binding tactics:

- Component Replacement: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement. The text mentions installing via pip with specific flags (like CFLAGS) but these are not replacements for components; they're configuration options during installation. No strong match.
Applicability analysis: Installation methods like 'pip install nmslib @ git+...' might involve replacing parts, but the tactic is about binding values through replacement, which isn't clearly described here.
No Match.

- Compile-time Parameterization: Binding at compile time via parameters. The text doesn't mention any parameterization during compilation for scispaCy itself; it's all about runtime installation and configuration.
No Match.

- Aspects: AOP concept binding values at build time. Not mentioned or implied in the text.
No Match.

- Configuration-time Binding: Binding at deployment time through config files. The text mentions using resource files (like Conda environments) but not explicit config files for scispaCy code.
Applicability analysis: Creating a Conda environment and specifying Python versions during setup could be considered configuration-time binding, as it's part of the deployment process before runtime starts.
Match.

- Resource Files: Binding values at startup using resource files. The text mentions installing via pip with specific commands that might involve resource files (like git repositories), but not explicitly for scispaCy code.
Applicability analysis: Installation from Git repository is a form of binding, but it's more about source control than resources. No direct link to the tactic definition.
No Match.

- Runtime Registration: Binding at runtime through registration mechanisms. The text doesn't describe any such mechanism for scispaCy; installation seems static and not dynamic during runtime.
No Match.

- Dynamic Lookup: Binding via service discovery at runtime. Not mentioned in the context of scispaCy code or deployment.
No Match.

- Interpret Parameters: Binding by interpreting parameters at runtime. The text has a command with CFLAGS, which are interpreted (flags passed to compiler), but this is during installation, not for the library's internal binding. Also, pip install commands might interpret flags, but again, it's about setup, not code-level binding.
Applicability analysis: The tactic involves interpreting parameters at runtime for service bindings, while CFLAGS example is a build-time configuration. Not directly applicable to scispaCy code architecture.
No Match.

- Startup Time Binding: Binding values during startup time. The text mentions installing via pip and then loading the model, but no explicit binding of services or configurations mentioned at startup for scispaCy itself.
Applicability analysis: When using Conda environments, activation might be considered part of startup, but it's not about binding values; it's more about environment setup. The installation commands are run before startup.
No Match.

- Name Servers: Binding via name servers at runtime. Not relevant to the text which is about code deployment and configuration.
No Match.

- Plug-ins: Loading functionality at runtime through plug-in mechanisms. The text doesn't describe any plugin system for scispaCy; it's all about direct installation or model downloads.
No Match.

- Publish-Subscribe: Binding via pub-sub pattern, not mentioned in the text.
No Match.

- Shared Repositories: Binding by sharing repositories at runtime. The text mentions installing from a Git repository but that is for code dependencies, and scispaCy itself isn't bound through shared repos; it's installed locally or system-wide.
Applicability analysis: The installation method using git might imply dependency on external repo, but the tactic definition is about binding values at runtime via shared repositories. Here, it's more static (installation time) and not dynamic binding during execution.
No Match.

- Polymorphism: Binding values at runtime through polymorphic behavior. Not mentioned in the text; installation methods are fixed and don't involve runtime polymorphism for service binding.
No Match.

Overall evaluation shows that 'Restrict Dependencies' is a match, while others have no strong applicability.",Restrict Dependencies,"The selected tactic of Restrict Dependencies applies because the text describes creating isolated Conda environments to manage Python versions and dependencies for scispaCy installation, thereby restricting what modules can interact with or be affected by other parts of the system.",None,None

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""Transforms potentially sharded filespecs into their paths for single shard. This function takes a shard number and a varargs of potentially-sharded filespecs, and returns a list where the filespecs have been resolved into concrete file paths for a single shard. This function has a concept of a master filespec, which is used to constrain and check the validity of other filespecs. The first filespec is considered the master, and it cannot be None. For example, if master is not sharded, none of the other specs can be sharded, and vice versa. They must all also have a consistent sharding (e.g., master is @10, then all others must be @10). Note that filespecs (except the master) may be None or any other False value, which are returned as-is in the output list. Args: shard: int >= 0. Our shard number. filespecs: list[str]. Contains all of the filespecs we want to resolve into shard-specific file paths. Returns: A list. The first element is the number of shards, which is an int >= 1 when filespecs contains sharded paths and 0 if none do. All subsequent returned values follow the shard-specific paths for each filespec, in order. Raises: ValueError: if any filespecs are inconsistent.""
",The text describes a function that resolves potentially-sharded file specifications into concrete file paths based on a master filespec and sharding consistency checks.,"This text addresses the need to ensure data integrity and consistency in distributed systems by checking sharding conditions, preventing inconsistencies between components.","Detect Faults: The function includes validity checks for filespecs (e.g., master cannot be None) which aligns with tactics like Condition Monitoring or Sanity Checking. However, it does not explicitly detect faults but rather enforces constraints to prevent them. Heartbeat is about periodic messaging and doesn't fit here. Timestamp isn't mentioned. Self-Test isn't present as the function doesn't test itself. Exception Detection might be relevant if inconsistencies are considered exceptions, but the text describes prevention through consistency checks.

Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: The function ensures consistent sharding which could prevent faults (prevention) rather than recovery. It does not handle failures or provide redundancy mechanisms like Active/Passive Redundancy. Rollback isn't mentioned as it reverts to a previous state, but this is about constraining input.

Recover from Faults_Reintroduction: No tactics here involve reintroducing failed components or shadowing.

Prevent Faults: The function explicitly checks for consistency and validity of filespecs (e.g., master cannot be None, all must have same sharding). This matches Condition Monitoring (checking conditions to prevent faults) and Exception Prevention (preventing exceptions by ensuring constraints are met). It also aligns with Sanity Checking as it validates the inputs.

- Split Module: The text does not mention splitting a module into smaller ones. It focuses on refactoring existing modules.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: This involves moving responsibilities to different modules. In the text, we see changes that might improve coherence by abstracting and making arguments optional, but it's not explicitly stated as such.
- Encapsulate: The text does not mention introducing an explicit interface or reducing propagation of changes through encapsulation.
- Use an Intermediary: No intermediary is introduced in the text. Changes are made directly to components without breaking dependencies via intermediaries.
- Restrict Dependencies: There's no indication that dependencies between modules were restricted.
- Refactor: The text explicitly mentions 'refactor' and describes several changes, including renaming classes, making arguments optional, abstracting services, and structuring data.

","The text describes a matrix of Python version compatibility and installation methods for nmslib, including issues with different operating systems and unconfirmed installations.",The goal is to improve the installability or configurability of the software by providing clear instructions and reducing difficulties in various environments.,"For Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules; it's about installation issues, so no match. For Increase Semantic Coherence: No discussion of module responsibilities or side effects reduction is present, so no match. For Encapsulate: There might be an implicit interface for Python versions, but the tactic definition requires explicit introduction to reduce propagation, and the text doesn't mention interfaces, only compatibility matrices, so no direct match. For Use an Intermediary: The matrix acts as a intermediary between users and installation methods, breaking dependencies by providing multiple ways (like different bindings), which could be seen as matching if we consider the binding tactics. However, let's check other applicable tactics first. Refactor is mentioned in Increase Cohesion but not directly here. For Restrict Dependencies: The text talks about restricting environments or methods for specific Python versions, so there might be a match with this tactic. But note that the definition of Restrict Dependencies says 'restricting the modules that a given module interacts with', which isn't exactly what's happening here; it's more about binding values (Python version) at different times and providing multiple ways to install. Let's look at Defer Binding tactics: Compile-time Parameterization, Configuration-time Binding, etc., seem relevant because they deal with when bindings occur.

- Refactor: No Match - The text does not involve restructuring code for better design principles like reducing duplication or improving modularity through refactoring.
- Abstract Common Services: No Match - There is no mention of creating abstract services from common functionalities to reduce modification costs.
- Component Replacement: Partial Match - The user mentions installing a model via pip, which could be seen as replacing the need for dynamic download with static installation. However, it's not explicitly about swapping components but rather ensuring they are present at build time.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No Match - The text does not involve binding values or parameters during compile time through mechanisms like templates or macros.
- Aspects: No Match - Aspect-oriented programming is not referenced in the context of pre-installing dependencies.
- Configuration-time Binding: Partial Match - Using a Dockerfile to install components before runtime could be considered configuration-time binding, as it's part of setting up the container. However, the user specifies that they want everything done via `Dockerfile` which might imply build time rather than deployment configuration.
- Resource Files: No Match - The tactic involves storing resources externally and loading them at runtime; here, pre-installation is about including files in the image itself.
- Runtime Registration: No Match - This would involve binding values during execution, but the user wants to avoid that by pre-installing.
- Dynamic Lookup: No Match - This refers to runtime resolution of dependencies, which contradicts the goal of avoiding downloads at runtime.
- Interpret Parameters: No Match - The text does not describe interpreting parameters for binding values.
- Startup Time Binding: Partial Match - Pre-installation in a Dockerfile might occur during startup preparation (e.g., build phase), but it's more about compile/build time. However, the user is concerned with having everything ready before execution starts.
- Name Servers: No Match - Not relevant to pre-installing files or avoiding runtime downloads.
- Plug-ins: No Match - The text does not involve loading external plug-in modules at runtime; instead, it's about static inclusion.
- Publish-Subscribe: No Match - This pattern is for decoupling components via messaging and doesn't apply here.
- Shared Repositories: No Match - Not relevant to pre-installing specific files or avoiding downloads.
- Polymorphism: No Match - The text does not discuss runtime binding through polymorphic behavior.",None,"No tactic from the provided list directly matches the user's request for pre-installation of Entity linkers in a Docker container to avoid runtime downloads, as tactics like Component Replacement and Configuration-time Binding are partially applicable but not precisely described or defined in this context.",None,None

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

16,deployability,"local) UMLS subsets; Hi scispacy team,. First of all, thanks for creating a great tool, I think it's very useful! I have a couple of questions related to the UMLS Entity Linker:. **Generic UMLS linker**. From the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf), I understand that scispacy links entities to UMLS concepts from sections 0, 1, 2 and 9 (SNOMED) of the UMLS 2017 AA release"". Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. . **Custom UMLS linker**. Somewhat related to 234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)? The reason I'm asking is twofold:. 1. UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy. Unless you're planning to do frequent updates on the model, I'd like to be able to use the most frequent concepts. 2. UMLS is highly customisable; users can select their own subsets of the many [vocabularies](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html). It would be great if this customisability is also applied in scispacy. My understanding is that it is possible by:. - Converting a UMLS `MRCONSO.RFF` file to JSON using [export_uml_json.py](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/export_uml_json.py). - Generating a [KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/linking_utils.py#L45) object . - Training a new linker using [create_tfidf_ann_index()](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L325 ).","

","The text discusses using a different BERT model for training Scibert by changing its configuration parameters. The user asks if simply replacing the 'name' parameter in the configuration with another BERT model's identifier is sufficient, or if additional steps are required.",The goal appears to be substituting one machine learning model (BERT) for another during training without significant modifications to the existing system. This suggests a desire for flexibility and ease of changing components while maintaining minimal disruption.,"Split Module: The text does not mention refining or splitting modules, so it doesn't match.
Increase Semantic Coherence: No discussion about moving responsibilities between modules or reducing side effects is present in the text.
Encapsulate: There's no explicit interface introduction mentioned for this change.
Use an Intermediary: Not used as a way to break dependencies; direct replacement of configuration seems simpler.
Restrict Dependencies: The text doesn't indicate restricting interactions, but rather enabling them by changing configurations.
Refactor: While the user might be considering refactoring aspects, there's no mention of factoring out common responsibilities or assigning them an appropriate home.
Abstract Common Services: No evidence that similar services are being implemented in a more general form. The change is about configuration parameterization.
Component Replacement: This tactic involves binding values at compile time or build time through replacement. In the text, the user considers replacing the 'name' parameter with another model's identifier (e.g., from allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased to bert-base-uncased). The question is whether this simple change works without constraints.
Compile-time Parameterization: This tactic binds values at compile time. However, in the text, the user suggests changing a configuration parameter which might be bound at runtime or during deployment, not necessarily at compile time.
Aspects: No mention of using aspects for binding values.
Configuration-time Binding: The text implies that by changing parameters (like 'name') at deployment time or startup, one can switch models. This aligns with the idea of configuration-time binding where values are set via config files during setup.
Resource Files: Not mentioned in the context of storing configurations externally for model switching.
Runtime Registration: No indication of registering components at runtime; the change is about specifying parameters beforehand.
Dynamic Lookup: The text doesn't describe looking up services dynamically, but rather changing a predefined parameter.
Interpret Parameters: This tactic involves binding values by interpreting parameters. In the text, the user changes the 'name' parameter to select different models, which could be seen as interpreting that parameter at configuration time or startup.
Startup Time Binding: The change might occur during startup if the configuration is read then and applied immediately.
Name Servers: Not relevant here; no mention of name servers for service discovery.
Plug-ins: While plug-in architectures allow dynamic addition of components, the text doesn't suggest loading models as plugins but rather changing a parameter. However, it could be an indirect application if we consider that different model names correspond to loaded plugin modules.
Publish-Subscribe: Not applicable; no messaging pattern or event-driven binding is discussed.
Shared Repositories: No shared repositories are mentioned for this purpose.",Component Replacement,"The text suggests replacing the BERT model by changing a configuration parameter, specifically asking if simply substituting the 'name' value in the configuration would work without constraints, which aligns with Component Replacement where values or components are bound at compile time through replacement mechanisms.",None,None

""Resources for Abbreviation Disambiguation in Scispacy?; Hello Scispacy Team,. I am currently exploring the use of Scispacy for processing medical texts and am particularly interested in the AbbreviationDetector component. I am looking to understand better the resources used for disambiguation of abbreviations, such as dictionaries or other structured forms that might be involved in this process. Could you provide details on the following:. 1. Does Scispacy utilize a specific dictionary or database for mapping abbreviations to their expanded forms? 2. If such a resource exists, is it available for review or export? I am interested in examining how comprehensive and up-to-date it is. 3. Additionally, any guidance on how the system handles disambiguation of abbreviations in varied contexts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!!""
","The user is asking about resources used for abbreviation disambiguation in Scispacy, specifically if it uses a dictionary or database and whether they can review or export it.",The text indicates an interest in understanding the underlying mechanisms of resource usage (dictionaries/databases) to potentially improve energy efficiency or system performance by examining how comprehensive these resources are.,"Resource Monitoring: The text does not mention collecting real-time data about energy consumption, but rather asks for details on existing static resources.

## Text To Analyze:

Contains the paths to the data required for the entity linker. ef_search: int, optional (default = 200) Controls speed performance at query time. Max value is 2000, but reducing to around ~100 will increase query speed by an order of magnitude for a small performance hit.""
",The text describes loading an approximate nearest neighbours index from disk and mentions parameters like linker_paths and ef_search which control the trade-off between query speed and accuracy.,"The goal is to optimize the balance between query speed and system performance, likely for efficient resource usage or scalability in a search application.","Resource Monitoring: The text does not mention collecting real-time data about energy consumption. It focuses on algorithm parameters rather than monitoring tools.
Static Classification: No indication of classifying resources statically based on device characteristics; the index is loaded from disk but no static classification method is described.
Dynamic Classification: Not mentioned, as there's no reference to using dynamic models for resource categorization.
Vertical Scaling: The text discusses adjusting parameters (ef_search) which affects performance, but does not involve adding or removing computational resources like CPU or memory. It's about tuning an algorithm.
Horizontal Scaling: No mention of adding more servers or VMs; the discussion is confined to parameter adjustments within a single system instance.
Scheduling: The text doesn't talk about allocating tasks over time for energy efficiency, but rather adjusting parameters for query performance.
Brokering: Not applicable as there's no matching service requests with providers based on energy characteristics mentioned in the text.
Service Adaptation: This tactic involves dynamically switching resources to more efficient ones. However, the text does not describe changing computational resources; it only adjusts an algorithm parameter (ef_search) which influences speed and performance trade-off.
Increase Efficiency: The text mentions improving query speed by adjusting ef_search, but this is a specific optimization for search algorithms rather than a general increase in efficiency of services or systems. It also implies matching service requests to hardware best suited if we consider the linker_paths parameter as part of that, but it's not explicitly stated.
Reduce Overhead: The text does not mention co-locating resources or removing intermediaries; instead, it talks about adjusting an algorithm parameter which might reduce overhead indirectly by changing performance characteristics.",None,"The provided text discusses optimizing query speed and accuracy through parameter adjustments in a search system, but none of the specified architectural tactics directly match this description as they all pertain to resource management or energy efficiency aspects not evident in the text.",None,None

1. **Discover Service**: This tactic involves locating a service through searching a known directory at runtime. The text does not mention any service discovery mechanism or runtime search of directories; it focuses on hyponym detection and data normalization fixes.
   - Applicability: Low, as there is no indication of discovering services via a directory.

2. **Orchestrate**: This tactic uses a control mechanism to coordinate multiple services that may be unaware of each other. The text describes the implementation of a component using SpaCy Matcher and mentions an Ontonotes mixin fix, but it does not describe any orchestration or coordination between different services. It is more about internal functionality.
   - Applicability: Low, no evidence of orchestrating multiple independent services.

3. **Tailor Interface**: This tactic involves modifying interfaces to add or remove capabilities like translation or buffering. The text mentions a fix for the format in the Ontonotes mixin and reducing duplication in entity linkers, which could be seen as tailoring the interface by adjusting how data is presented or handled. However, it does not explicitly state that an interface was tailored (e.g., adding or removing functions). It's more about fixing inconsistencies.

","The text describes a matrix for testing nmslib installation across various environments and Python versions, including specific instructions for using Mamba and other methods like pip install with flags or from source.",The goal is to provide clear installation guidance by specifying different approaches based on environment compatibility.,"For Split Module: The text does not discuss splitting modules but focuses on installation scenarios. No Match.

Increase Semantic Coherence: Not applicable as the text deals with system-level configurations, not internal module responsibilities. No Match.

Encapsulate: The text mentions using an intermediary (Mamba) to set up environments, which could be seen as encapsulating environment setup. However, it does not explicitly introduce a new interface for that purpose. It is more about tool usage than encapsulation in the architectural sense. No Match.

Use an Intermediary: This tactic involves breaking dependencies by using an intermediary. The text uses Mamba (a virtual environment manager) as an intermediary to handle different Python versions and environments, thus reducing direct dependency issues between system components or installations. However, it does not explicitly break a single dependency but rather provides a way to manage multiple ones indirectly. There is some applicability in terms of managing complexity through an intermediary tool.

Abstract Common Services: The text doesn't abstract services for reuse; it focuses on conditional installation methods based on environment specifics. No Match.

Component Replacement: This tactic binds values at compile time or build time by replacing components. The text does not mention any replacement during builds, but rather dynamic instructions based on the system's capabilities (like using Mamba). No Match.

Compile-time Parameterization: Not applicable as the text is about runtime installation decisions. No Match.

Aspects: This involves compile-time binding via aspects, which are not mentioned in the text. The text describes conditional methods for installation. No Match.

Configuration-time Binding: The matrix suggests different bindings based on environment (e.g., using resource files or configuration). However, it doesn't explicitly use a configuration file to bind values at deployment time; instead, it lists various scenarios and instructions that are applied during setup. There is some similarity in the idea of binding depending on context.

Resource Files: The text does not mention any resource files being used for binding purposes. No Match.

Runtime Registration: Not applicable as there's no runtime registration mentioned. No Match.

Dynamic Lookup: This tactic binds values at runtime through dynamic lookup, which is not described in the text. The instructions are static based on environment checks. No Match.

Interpret Parameters: Binds values by interpreting parameters during installation commands. The text provides specific pip install commands with flags or from source, but it doesn't explicitly interpret parameters to change behavior; rather, different methods are suggested for different cases. There is a slight match in the idea of parameterizing the command based on environment.

Startup Time Binding: This tactic binds values at runtime during startup. The text mentions setting up virtual environments and then installing via pip or other commands, but it doesn't specify binding at startup time without prior setup. No Match.

Name Servers: Not applicable to installation instructions; irrelevant here. No Match.

Plug-ins: The text does not mention plug-in mechanisms for installation. It's about direct methods or using tools like Mamba. No Match.

Publish-Subscribe: This is a pattern for decoupling components, but the text doesn't describe such a mechanism in the context of installation. No Match.

When I explored further, I understood that I can take the help of UMLS integration, where for each entity returned by the en_core_sci_lg, we can extract the umls_ent using entity._.umls_ents and then get it's **concept name, concept id, type** and even threshold score. Here I am using **type**, and by using **type codes** from **UMLS_Semantic_Type_Tree**, I am trying to classify the entity into either Disease or treatment. Problem is, I'm getting false positives by using this approach and also sometimes I am missing the entities too. Please find the disease, treatment codes, and also other things which I am using in my code. **disease_codes** : T041, T047, T048, T184, T191, T005. **treatment_codes** : T091, T061, T060, T059. **linker_lg = UmlsEntityLinker(k=5)** and also tried **max_entities_per_mention** parameter with different values. Please find some of the **False Positives** below:. **Disease:** push pull, drive, global delay, decision, reasoning e.t.c. **Treatment:** medication delivery, hygiene, elevation, counseling group e.t.c. So, what else I can do ""
","The user describes a problem with entity extraction in medical text using the SciSpacy library. They initially used a specialized NER model for diseases but missed some entities. Then they switched to a broader model (en_core_sci_lg) that extracts all medical-related entities without classification, and by integrating UMLS, they attempt to classify entities into disease or treatment categories based on type codes. However, this approach introduces false positives and sometimes misses entities.","The text addresses the need for accurate entity extraction and classification in medical texts, specifically aiming to correctly identify 'Disease' and 'Treatment' related entities while minimizing errors such as false positives and missed entities.","I will evaluate each tactic based on its definition against the provided text.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

- Split Module: The text does not discuss module splitting or reducing average change cost, so No Match.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: Not mentioned; focus is on installation procedure, no refactoring for side effects reduction, so No Match.
- Encapsulate: The explicit interface part of encapsulation isn't addressed in the instructions. Conda environment setup doesn't inherently reduce propagation risks as described by encapsulation tactics, so No Match.

- Restrict Dependencies: The text implies dependency management through version constraints (e.g., model links containing scispacy versions), but doesn't explicitly restrict interactions via visibility/authorization mechanisms. However, the upgrade note suggests a form of binding that ensures compatibility by restricting to specific models for given versions, which aligns with the spirit of restriction tactics if we interpret 'binding' as dependency management.

- Refactor: The text doesn't mention factoring out common responsibilities or refactoring efforts, so No Match.
- Abstract Common Services: Not discussed; no abstract service implementation mentioned, so No Match.

However, this is more about deployment than build-time replacement as per tactic definition. But note that scispacy itself might be considered a component being replaced in environments. Since the text doesn't explicitly describe binding values through replacement mechanisms for dependencies, it's not a strong match.
- Compile-time Parameterization: The installation uses version numbers (e.g., v0.5.4) but they are specified at deployment time via URLs or build scripts? Not compile-time; instructions are given during runtime setup. So No Match.
- Aspects: Not mentioned, so No Match.
- Configuration-time Binding: This involves binding values at deployment time through configuration files. The text doesn't use config files for binding model versions to scispacy upgrades. It uses URLs or direct pip install with version constraints in the URL path. So No Match.
- Resource Files: Not used as a source of runtime values, so No Match.
- Runtime Registration: Models are loaded at runtime via spacy.load(), but they aren't bound through registration mechanisms described by this tactic. The binding happens via file paths or URLs during setup, not dynamically registered services. So No Match.
- Dynamic Lookup: Not used for service binding; models are statically referenced in the code (spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm"")). So No Match.
- Interpret Parameters: Models aren't bound by interpreting parameters at runtime from user input or config. The version is hardcoded in the URL path, so No Match.
- Startup Time Binding: This tactic binds values during startup. In scispacy installation, after activating the environment and creating it, you run pip install which could be considered binding models at deployment time (startup of the system). However, the text doesn't explicitly say 'bind' or describe a mechanism for dependency injection at startup. It's more about static configuration in URLs. But note that once installed, spaCy loads the model via its runtime mechanisms. The upgrade note implies that during the initial setup (which includes starting up the environment and installing), you bind specific models based on scispacy version. This is a bit of stretch but might align with startup time binding if we consider the entire process as part of system startup.
- Name Servers: Not used, so No Match.
- Plug-ins: The text doesn't describe plug-in mechanisms for dynamic service loading; it's about installing models into an existing framework. So No Match.
- Publish-Subscribe: Not relevant to binding model versions during installation or upgrade, so No Match.
- Shared Repositories: Models are installed per environment and not shared via repositories in the architectural sense described by this tactic (e.g., a central repository for services). The text doesn't mention sharing. So No Match.
- Polymorphism: Not used to bind model versions at runtime; models are loaded by name, which is fixed for each version. So No Match.",None,"The provided text describes installation and upgrade procedures but does not explicitly discuss or implement any architectural tactics from the list such as Split Module, Increase Semantic Coherence, Encapsulate, etc., nor does it describe a mechanism for binding values at runtime through techniques like startup time binding.",None,None

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes various methods for installing and using the scispaCy library, including different installation commands (e.g., pip install nmslib, mamba create environment), setting up virtual environments with Mamba or Conda, activating environments, loading models, and notes on upgrading. It also mentions unconfirmed methods from GitHub issues.",The text addresses the problem of installing a library that depends on other components (like nmslib) by providing multiple installation options including using virtual environments and different package managers to manage dependencies effectively.,"For each tactic, I will analyze its applicability based solely on the provided text.

- Split Module: The text does not discuss splitting modules or reducing code size. It focuses on installation methods, so no match.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: There is no mention of moving responsibilities between modules to reduce side effects. Installation instructions are about functionality, not coherence.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction for the library itself is described in the text. The focus is on dependency management and installation.
- Use an Intermediary: Not mentioned; there's no intermediary being used to break dependencies between components during installation.
- Restrict Dependencies: While the text mentions setting up a virtual environment (which isolates dependencies), it doesn't explicitly restrict which modules are interacted with. The goal is dependency management, but not through restricting access as per tactic definition.
- Refactor: No discussion of factoring out common responsibilities from code modules or assigning them to appropriate homes in the context of installation instructions.
- Abstract Common Services: Not applicable; no mention of implementing services in an abstract form for scispaCy's installation process.

For Defer Binding tactics:

- Component Replacement: The text does not describe binding values at compile time through replacement. It focuses on runtime and deployment-time installations.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No parameterization at compile time is mentioned; all bindings seem to be done via commands or configuration.
- Aspects: Not used in the installation process described, as there's no aspect-based approach for binding values.
- Configuration-time Binding: The text mentions installing via pip with different flags (e.g., `CFLAGS`), which could be considered a form of configuration-time binding. However, it doesn't explicitly state that these bindings are done at deployment time through configuration files or similar mechanisms.
- Resource Files: No resource files like .ini or config files are mentioned for scispaCy installation; the instructions use command-line parameters and direct installations.
- Runtime Registration: The text does not describe binding values during runtime. It focuses on initial setup before running code.
- Dynamic Lookup: Not applicable; no mention of services being looked up dynamically at runtime.
- Interpret Parameters: Installation commands like `pip install nmslib` with CFLAGS might involve interpreting parameters, but the tactic is defined for binding values (like configuration) and not directly tied to these installation steps.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

",The text describes a class hierarchy for reading genomics data. It defines an abstract `GenomicsReader` API that is subclassed by concrete implementations like `TFRecordReader`. There's also a `DispatchingGenomicsReader` which provides convenience and supports multiple input formats based on file names.,"The text discusses the design of classes for reading genomics data, focusing on an interface (`GenomicsReader`) that is subclassed by various implementations. This suggests goals related to abstraction, modularity (via subclasses), and possibly reducing coupling between different reader types or allowing easier extension with new file formats.","Evaluating each tactic:
- Split Module: The text describes a class hierarchy but doesn't mention splitting existing modules into smaller ones. It focuses on the structure of classes, so this might not be directly applicable.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: There's no explicit discussion about moving responsibilities to different modules or reducing side effects by better organization. The goal is more about providing an interface and handling various formats rather than improving internal module logic.
- Encapsulate: No mention of introducing interfaces specifically to reduce coupling via visibility controls.
- Use an Intermediary: Not evident; the text doesn't describe breaking dependencies with intermediaries like a service or facade.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text mentions that concrete implementations are in type-specific modules, but it doesn't explicitly restrict dependencies between these classes. It describes how readers can be instantiated and used based on file types.
- Refactor: No indication of factoring out common responsibilities from existing modules to reduce duplication elsewhere; the focus is on defining an API and its subclasses.
- Abstract Common Services: The `GenomicsReader` class appears to abstract a common service (the core API) that all readers share. This aligns with the definition, as it's implemented once in an abstract form for multiple use cases.
- Component Replacement: Not mentioned; no indication of binding values through build scripts or replacements.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No parameterization at compile time is discussed; the examples show runtime usage and instantiation.
- Aspects: The text doesn't involve aspects, which are typically used for cross-cutting concerns via compile-time weaving.
- Configuration-time Binding: Not mentioned; no configuration during deployment or setup is described in this context.
- Resource Files: No use of resource files for binding values at startup or initialization time.
- Runtime Registration: Not discussed; the examples show direct instantiation and method calls, not registration.
- Dynamic Lookup: The text doesn't describe services being looked up dynamically at runtime. It's about class inheritance and specific implementations.
- Interpret Parameters: There is a mention of `kwargs` which are reader-specific keyword arguments. This could be seen as interpreting parameters to configure the reader behavior, but it might not fully align with the tactic definition without explicit parameter interpretation for binding values.
- Startup Time Binding: Not mentioned; no examples or description of binding during startup time.
- Name Servers: No indication of using name servers for runtime binding.
- Plug-ins: The text doesn't describe loading implementations dynamically via plug-ins. It's a static class hierarchy.
- Publish-Subscribe: This pattern is about decoupling through messaging, not present in the described reader classes.
- Shared Repositories: Not mentioned; no shared data structures or repositories for binding values at runtime.

- Abstract Common Services: There is no mention of implementing common services in an abstract form across modules; the updates are focused on adding support and fixing issues without abstracting shared functionalities. No Match.
- Component Replacement: The text mentions replacing nmslib with nmslib-metabrainz, which aligns with binding values at compile time or build time through replacement. However, it's not explicitly stated as a component replacement tactic for the architectural purpose of deferring binding; but in this case, it is part of updating for Python 3.12 compatibility.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No mention of parameterizing code at compile time to bind values or configurations. The changes are about updates and additions without compile-time mechanisms described. No Match.
- Aspects: Aspect-oriented programming concepts like aspects are not mentioned in the text; it's a standard update for Python version compatibility. No Match.

- Name Servers: Not relevant to the changes described; no mention of using name servers for service discovery in Python 3.12 support. No Match.
- Plug-ins: The text does not describe loading services at runtime via plug-ins, but rather a direct replacement or update.

Note that the input variants provided to this class aren't checked in any way, and their ordering determines the order of variants emitted by this class for the iterate() and query() operations. This is intentional, to make this class easy to use for testing where you often want to use less-than-perfectly formed inputs. In order to fully meet the contract of a standard VcfReader, variants should be sorted by their contig ordering and then by their start and finally by their ends. Implementation note: The current implementation will be very slow for query() if the provided cache of variants is large, as we do a O(n) search to collect all of the overlapping variants for each query. There are several straightforward optimizations to do if we need/want to scale this up. (a) sort the variants and use a binary search to find overlapping variants (b) partition the variants by contig, so we have dict[contig] => [variants on contig], which allows us to completely avoid considering any variants on any other contigs. Neither of these optimizations are worth it if len(variants) is small, but it may be worth considering if we want to use this functionality with a large number of variants.","

## Text To Analyze:
""Class for reading Variant protos from an in-memory cache of variants. ```python from third_party.nucleus.io import vcf from third_party.nucleus.protos import variants_pb2 variants = [... Variant protos ...] header = variants_pb2.VcfHeader() with vcf.InMemoryVcfReader(variants, header) as reader: for variant in reader: print(variant) ``` This class accepts a collection of variants and optionally a header and provides all of the standard API functions of VcfReader but instead of fetching variants from a file the variants are queried from an in-memory cache of variant protos. Note that the input variants provided to this class aren't checked in any way, and their ordering determines the order of variants emitted by this class for the iterate() and query() operations. This is intentional, to make this class easy to use for testing where you often want to use less-than-perfectly formed inputs. In order to fully meet the contract of a standard VcfReader, variants should be sorted by their contig ordering and then by their start and finally by their ends. Implementation note: The current implementation will be very slow for query() if the provided cache of variants is large, as we do a O(n) search to collect all of the overlapping variants for each query. There are several straightforward optimizations to do if we need/want to scale this up. (a) sort the variants and use a binary search to find overlapping variants (b) partition the variants by contig, so we have dict[contig] => [variants on contig], which allows us to completely avoid considering any variants on any other contigs. Neither of these optimizations are worth it if len(variants) is small, but it may be worth considering if we want to use this functionality with a large number of variants.""
","The text describes an in-memory VcfReader class that reads Variant protos from a cache without input validation. It notes that the order of variants depends on their ordering and provides optimizations for handling large caches, such as sorting or partitioning by contig.",The goal is to provide efficient iteration/query over in-memory variant data with minimal overhead when inputs are small but optimized scaling for larger datasets.,"Detect Faults: The text does not describe fault detection mechanisms. It mentions that input variants aren't checked, which could be a fault tolerance issue but isn't framed as detection.
Monitor: No mention of a component monitoring system health or conditions.
Heartbeat: Not discussed; no periodic messaging for reachability.
Timestamp: Events are assigned timestamps implicitly by their order in the cache, but not explicitly mentioned for fault detection.
Sanity Checking: Input variants aren't checked, so this tactic is not applied here.
Condition Monitoring: The text does not involve monitoring conditions to prevent faults.
Voting: Not relevant; no multiple components voting on output consistency.
Exception Detection: No mechanism described for detecting exceptions in the input data or during processing.
Self-Test: The class itself doesn't self-test, and there's no mention of testing its functionality.
Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair: Optimizations like sorting are preparation steps but not recovery. Passive Redundancy is about state updates; not applicable here.
Active Redundancy: Not mentioned; the system isn't configured with parallel processing or redundant nodes.
Spare: No cold sparing mechanism described in this text.
Exception Handling: The class doesn't handle exceptions from faulty inputs, but it's designed to accept less-than-perfect data. However, no specific handling is discussed.
Rollback: Not relevant; the system isn't reverting to a previous state upon failure.
Software Upgrade: No upgrades mentioned or described in this text.
Retry: The class doesn't retry operations if they fail due to input issues.
Ignore Faulty Behavior: This might be related, as inputs aren't checked and are used intentionally without validation. However, the optimizations suggest that proper ordering should be done for correctness, so it's not clear if ignoring is part of the design or just a feature.
Degradation: Not mentioned; no dropping less critical functions to maintain critical ones.
Reconfiguration: No reassigning responsibilities upon failure described here.
Recover from Faults_Reintroduction: Shadow mode isn't discussed. State Resynchronization might be implied by ensuring correct order, but not explicitly stated as a recovery mechanism for faults.
Non-Stop Forwarding: Not relevant; no split into control and data planes mentioned.
Prevent Faults: Removal from Service is about temporarily taking out components to prevent failures, which isn't the case here. Transactions aren't discussed or needed. Predictive Model would require monitoring conditions predictive of faults, not present in this text. Exception Prevention might be related if proper ordering prevents exceptions, but it's unclear. Increase Competence Set: This could relate to handling more cases by being flexible with input order, allowing for easier testing without strict validation.",None,"The provided text does not describe any specific architectural tactic from the list; while there are mentions of optimizations and intentional lack of checks, these do not align strongly with any defined tactic in the context given.",None,None

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.

- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.

","The user reports difficulty in installing the nmslib module on Windows 10, with failures occurring during pip installation due to an issue related to c++ tools and other preparatory steps. They mention that downloading from GitHub also fails, and direct installation via setup.py does not work for both building and installing. The user expresses frustration over several hours of unsuccessful attempts and requests assistance.","The text describes a problem with the installation process of a module on Windows 10, indicating failures in multiple methods (pip, GitHub download, setup.py). This suggests an issue related to system configuration or dependency management that prevents successful deployment. The underlying goal is likely 'prevent errors' or ensure reliable installation.","For each tactic:
- **Ping/Echo**: Not applicable; no mention of reachability checks between nodes.
- **Monitor**: Applicable as the user mentions issues with system components (installation, dependencies) and wants to detect problems. However, not directly mentioned in the text.
- **Heartbeat**: Not applicable; no periodic message exchange for fault detection is described.
- **Timestamp**: Not relevant; no sequence of events or time-based checks are discussed.
- **Sanity Checking**: Applicable if we consider checking the validity of installation steps. The user might be implicitly asking for a way to validate that each step was done correctly, but it's not explicitly mentioned.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Highly applicable as the text describes monitoring conditions during setup (checking dependencies) and preventing faulty behavior by ensuring all prerequisites are met.
- **Voting**: Not relevant; no multiple components with identical inputs or voting logic is discussed.
- **Exception Detection**: Applicable since installation failures are exceptions that need to be detected. The user reports several failure modes, which could be considered as exceptions.
- **Self-Test**: Potentially applicable if the module had self-testing capabilities during setup, but not mentioned in the text.

**Recovery Preparation and Repair Tactic Evaluation**:
- **Active Redundancy**: Not relevant; no parallel processing or redundancy for installation is discussed.
- **Passive Redundancy**: Not applicable; no active/passive configuration for system nodes involved here.
- **Spare**: Not applicable; the issue isn't about having redundant components to take over, but rather a failure in installing one component.
- **Exception Handling**: Applicable if we consider handling installation exceptions. The user is describing an exception (installation failure) that needs to be handled or detected.
- **Rollback**: Potentially relevant if there was a previous good state before the failed installation attempt, but no such information is provided in the text.
- **Software Upgrade**: Not applicable; the issue isn't about upgrading software, but installing it. Also, no upgrade process mentioned.
- **Retry**: Applicable as the user might be suggesting to retry the installation command or steps multiple times until success (though they haven't explicitly done so). The text implies that the failure is transient and could be resolved by repeated attempts.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Not directly applicable; no faulty behavior from a component being ignored during setup. However, if we consider ignoring failed installations to proceed with other tasks, it might fit loosely but not strongly.
- **Degradation**: Not relevant; the issue is about preventing installation failure entirely, not maintaining functions in degraded mode.
- **Reconfiguration**: Applicable as the user may need a different configuration or environment setup (like installing C++ tools) to proceed with the installation. This tactic involves changing system structure based on detected faults.

**Recover from Faults_Reintroduction Tactic Evaluation**:
- **Shadow**: Not applicable; no shadow mode operation for failed components in this context.
- **State Resynchronization**: Not relevant; there's no mention of synchronizing states after a failure. The issue is about initial setup, not recovery from an ongoing fault.
- **Escalating Restart**: Not applicable; the problem isn't with restarting processes but with installation failures.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Completely irrelevant to this text as it deals with system installation and configuration issues, not data or control plane operations in a running system.

**Prevent Faults Tactic Evaluation**:
- **Removal from Service**: Not applicable; the issue is about installing a module, not removing one that's already installed. Also, no service impact mentioned.
- **Transactions**: Applicable if we consider ensuring atomic and consistent installation steps (e.g., all-or-nothing). The user wants reliable installation without partial success or failure.
- **Predictive Model**: Not directly applicable; the text describes a current failure during setup, not using predictive models to anticipate future faults. However, one could argue that monitoring conditions might be part of this if done beforehand.
- **Exception Prevention**: Highly applicable as the user is experiencing exceptions (installation failures) and wants them prevented or handled more gracefully.",Retry,"The text describes installation failures during multiple steps (pip, setup.py build), suggesting that these failures might be transient, making Retry an appropriate tactic to assume success after a failure and attempt again.",Installation process was attempted again successfully.,None

","The text discusses ScispaCy's capability to identify biomedical entities from text using various models, highlighting that combining outputs from different models can compensate for their individual shortcomings and improve entity identification accuracy by considering both abbreviations and full phrases.","The goal is to enhance the accuracy and completeness of biomedical entity extraction in text processing by integrating multiple models or approaches. This suggests a need for improved robustness, flexibility, and potentially better resource utilization through combination rather than relying on a single model.","Evaluating each tactic:
- Metering: The text does not mention monitoring energy consumption; it focuses on entity extraction accuracy.
- Static Classification: No static classification of resources or tasks is discussed in the context of ScispaCy's models. The goal is about combining model outputs, which doesn't fit with classifying based on device characteristics.
- Dynamic Classification: While there might be a dynamic aspect to how entities are recognized (e.g., abbreviations), the text does not describe using dynamic models for classification or energy purposes; it's more about task allocation and combination of results.
- Vertical Scaling: The discussion is about combining different models, which relates to increasing processing power through parallelism, but there's no mention of adding/removing resources based on demand in terms of CPU/GPU scaling. It's focused on model integration for accuracy.

## Text To Analyze:
""Pin scispacy to 2.1.x; The current models are not compatible with spacy 2.2. Pinning the scispacy version until we can upgrade to 2.2 and release new models.""
","The text discusses pinning a specific library (scispacy) to an older version (2.1.x) due to compatibility issues with newer versions of another library (spacy), specifically because current models are not compatible with spacy 2.2 until new models are released.","The underlying goal is to maintain compatibility and stability by preventing the use of incompatible components, likely to avoid errors or system failures during upgrades.","For Metering: The text does not mention any resource monitoring or energy consumption data collection. It's about library version control, so No Match.

For Static Classification: There is no indication of classifying devices based on characteristics without real-time data. The focus is on software compatibility, so No Match.

For Dynamic Classification: Not applicable as the text doesn't involve using dynamic models for classification or energy estimation. It's about pinning a version, so No Match.

For Vertical Scaling: The action described (pinning scispacy) does not align with adding/removing resources dynamically to meet processing demands. Pinning is more of a constraint than scaling, so No Match.

For Horizontal Scaling: This tactic involves distributing tasks across multiple servers or VMs for scalability and energy efficiency. The text is about version pinning, which doesn't relate to horizontal distribution, so No Match.

For Scheduling: While scheduling can involve optimizing resource allocation, the text does not mention allocating tasks based on energy considerations or constraints. It's purely about compatibility, so No Match.

For Brokering: This involves matching service requests with providers based on energy characteristics. The text doesn't discuss selecting different computational resources for services, only version pinning, so No Match.

For Increase Efficiency: This tactic includes improving algorithm performance or matching hardware to tasks. Pinning a library might be done temporarily while waiting for more efficient models, but the text does not explicitly state an improvement in efficiency; it's about compatibility until upgrades are possible. However, by pinning, they're preventing potential inefficiencies from incompatible changes, so borderline applicability exists.

For Reduce Overhead: This tactic involves co-location and removal of intermediaries to reduce overhead. The text doesn't mention any reduction in computational overhead or energy demands directly; it's about avoiding an issue until a fix is available. But pinning might be seen as preventing unnecessary overhead from retraining or errors, so there could be some indirect link.

For Service Adaptation: This tactic involves dynamically switching resources for better efficiency. The text doesn't describe any dynamic adaptation of services to different computational resources; it's about maintaining a fixed version due to compatibility issues until an upgrade is possible. So No Match.

1. Split Module: The text does not mention refining a module into smaller ones; it focuses on specialization and different treatment of string fields within an existing system.
2. Increase Semantic Coherence: This involves moving unrelated responsibilities to separate modules, but the text is about handling specific requirements for certain fields (strings), which might involve grouping similar behaviors rather than separating them.
3. Encapsulate: The text does not describe introducing interfaces or reducing propagation of changes; it's more about specialization and instantiation.
4. Use an Intermediary: No mention of breaking dependencies with intermediaries in the provided text.
5. Restrict Dependencies: This tactic is about limiting interactions, but the text doesn't discuss restricting anything; it talks about specialized handling.
6. Refactor: The text mentions 'specialized instantiation', which could be a form of refactoring to handle specific cases differently, but without explicit mention of removing duplication or reassigning common services, this might not be the best fit.
7. Abstract Common Services: This tactic is for implementing similar services in an abstract way once. The text does not describe such abstraction; it talks about specialized handling for strings.
8. Component Replacement: Not mentioned as a method of binding values through replacement scripts or makefiles.
9. Compile-time Parameterization: No indication that the instantiation is done at compile time.
10. Aspects, Configuration-time Binding, Resource Files, Runtime Registration, Dynamic Lookup, Interpret Parameters, Startup Time Binding, Name Servers, Plug-ins, Publish-Subscribe, Shared Repositories, Polymorphism: These tactics are about binding values (like configuration or runtime) but the text is specifically about specialized instantiation for string fields.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

","The text describes various methods for installing and configuring scispaCy, including pip installation with different flags, using virtual environments like Mamba or Conda, creating specific Python versions, activating environments, loading models, and noting the need to re-download compatible models when upgrading.","The text addresses the problem of managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility during software installation, particularly in a modular system where different components (models) must align with their host framework (scispaCy).","For each tactic:
- Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules into smaller ones; it focuses on installation methods. No Match.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: There is no discussion about moving responsibilities or reducing side effects through better module organization. No Match.
- Encapsulate: While using virtual environments (like Conda) can be seen as encapsulation by isolating dependencies, the text does not explicitly introduce an interface for a module to reduce change propagation. The installation steps are more about dependency management than encapsulation per se. However, it is somewhat related but not directly applicable. No Match.
- Use an Intermediary: Not mentioned; no intermediary breaking dependencies in the context of installation. No Match.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text does mention restricting dependencies by using virtual environments (Mamba/Conda) to isolate Python versions and packages, which aligns with this tactic's definition. However, it is more about environment setup than direct dependency restriction within a module. It could be considered as an application of the tactic but not explicitly described in terms of code structure or binding values at different times. This might be a stretch. Let's say No Match for now.
- Refactor: The text does not discuss factoring out common responsibilities from modules. Instead, it talks about installation procedures and model compatibility. No Match.
- Abstract Common Services: Not mentioned; no abstract services being implemented once to reduce modification costs in the context of this text. No Match.

Defer Binding tactics:
- Component Replacement: The text mentions installing via pip with different commands that might involve replacing components, but it's not clear if these are build scripts or replacements for binding values at compile time. It seems more about runtime installation methods. Not a strong match.
- Compile-time Parameterization: No mention of parameterizing during compilation (e.g., flags in build tools). The text uses pip and Conda commands which might be considered as configuration, but not compile-time. No Match.
- Aspects: Aspect-oriented programming is mentioned elsewhere? But here it's about installation methods, no aspects involved. No Match.
- Configuration-time Binding: This tactic involves binding values at deployment time through configuration. The text describes various ways to install scispaCy (via pip with different flags) and set up environments, which could be seen as configuring the system before runtime. However, it's not explicitly about binding values for services or components during deployment; more about installation steps that might affect how dependencies are handled. It is somewhat applicable but let's see if there's a better fit.
- Resource Files: Not mentioned in this text; no use of resource files to bind values at startup. No Match.
- Runtime Registration: The text does not describe binding values at runtime through registration mechanisms for services. Instead, it talks about installation and model loading. No Match.
- Dynamic Lookup: This involves looking up services at runtime without compile-time or configuration time binding. The text mentions installing via pip with different commands that might be used to configure the system, but no dynamic service lookup is described. No Match.
- Interpret Parameters: Not mentioned; installation methods are not about interpreting parameters for bindings during startup or runtime. No Match.
- Startup Time Binding: This tactic involves binding values at runtime during startup (e.g., via resource files). The text mentions installing scispaCy and then loading models, but the binding of model versions to specific `scispacy` versions is done through installation commands, not necessarily at startup time. However, it does say that when upgrading `scispacy`, you need to download compatible models again, which implies a dependency on runtime or configuration-time information for compatibility. But this doesn't directly describe the tactic of binding values at startup. No Match.
- Name Servers: Not mentioned; no use of name servers for service discovery during installation. No Match.
- Plug-ins: The text does not mention plug-in mechanisms where services are bound at runtime through plugins. Instead, it talks about installing specific models via pip or from GitHub. This could be a stretch if we consider that the model is being loaded as a plugin-like structure (since they are separate components), but the installation methods don't specify binding values at runtime; they just install them. No Match.
- Publish-Subscribe: Not relevant to this text, which is about installing and loading models, not messaging patterns. No Match.
- Shared Repositories: This tactic involves using shared repositories for data or services during runtime. The text does not mention any shared repository mechanism for binding values at runtime. Instead, it talks about separate installations of scispaCy and its models. No Match.

","The text describes an approach using a TfidfVectorizer for embedding mentions into character 3-grams, then comparing them via cosine distance in an approximate nearest neighbours index (nmslib). This system retrieves K nearest neighbours but may return fewer due to entity canonicalization and includes aliases that can map multiple strings to the same canonical entity. The issue is that some strings match multiple entities exactly, leading to poor performance for a naive k-nn baseline linker because of distance 0.0 matches from different entities.

Reduce Overhead: The tactic aims to reduce resources consumed in processing. The text mentions that including aliases is important but causes performance issues; no explicit overhead reduction is described.
Bound Execution Times: This involves placing limits on execution time. The text does not discuss bounding execution times, only the accuracy issue with k-nn baseline.

Finally, as a general note, other that the _specific_ `nmslib` usages I tried to leave the code as much unchanged as possible although it is now possible that certain checks/crashes may not occur. Please advise on next steps, I am willing to test this on a different device (allowing `nmslib` install) but would need guidance on evaluation procedures/metrics. I hope this PR succinctly shows that switching (at least) _may_ be possible without too much overhead and that would open up `scispacy` for usage on more platforms with more python versions.","

A few important notes on `annoy` vs `nmslib`:. - annoy claims to support cosine distance but it was not an option, so it appears to be supported via euclidean distance. - annoy only supports two major configurable parameters. - number of trees generates (`n_trees` at index build time). - `k_search` at search/run-time as configurable parameters. - annoy doesn't support batch adding/searching so loops were required. Finally, as a general note, other that the _specific_ `nmslib` usages I tried to leave the code as much unchanged as possible although it is now possible that certain checks/crashes may not occur. Please advise on next steps, I am willing to test this on a different device (allowing `nmslib` install) but would need guidance on evaluation procedures/metrics. I hope this PR succinctly shows that switching (at least) _may_ be possible without too much overhead and that would open up `scispacy` for usage on more platforms with more python versions.""
","The text describes a pull request to replace the dependency on nmslib with annoy, a library by Spotify. The changes are confined to scispacy/candidate_generation.py, but there is uncertainty about compatibility and functionality due to lack of testing.","The goal appears to be reducing dependencies on potentially problematic libraries (nmslib) by switching to an alternative (annoy), which may improve maintainability and support for more platforms.","For Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules, so no match.

For Increase Semantic Coherence: No explicit restructuring or moving of responsibilities is mentioned; the change is about replacing a library. So no match.

For Encapsulate: There's no mention of introducing an interface to reduce propagation of changes. So no match.

For Use an Intermediary: The text does not describe using an intermediary module between two components. No match.

For Restrict Dependencies: While the dependency on nmslib is removed, there's no explicit restriction mechanism mentioned (like visibility or authorization). However, removing a dependency can be seen as restricting it implicitly. But this tactic typically refers to controlling dependencies at design time, not just removing them. The text doesn't specify how dependencies are restricted in general. So borderline but ultimately No Match.

For Refactor: The author mentions leaving the code unchanged except for specific changes related to nmslib replacement. This suggests minimal refactoring beyond what was necessary for the switch. However, the tactic definition says 'Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home'. There's no mention of factoring out or reassigning common services; it's a library swap. So No Match.

So No match.",None,"The changes described are a library replacement, which does not align with any of the specified tactics from the relevant list provided for cohesion or coupling reduction; it is more about dependency management and maintainability but those specific tactics don't fit.",None,None

","The text discusses the possibility of customizing UMLS Entity Linker in scispacy to use local UMLS subsets for users with licenses, allowing access to updated concepts like COVID-19 and leveraging UMLS's customisability.","The goal is to enable users to utilize their own UMLS subsets or updates by modifying the existing linker configuration, thereby improving flexibility and adaptability of the tool.","For Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules into smaller ones. Instead, it talks about using local data without changing structure.

For Increase Semantic Coherence: No discussion about moving responsibilities or reducing side effects through better module organization is present in the text.

For Encapsulate: There's no explicit introduction of an interface to restrict changes; the focus is on configuration and binding values externally.

For Use an Intermediary: The text does not describe breaking dependencies with intermediaries like a service bus or similar patterns.

For Restrict Dependencies: No mention of restricting which modules interact, though using local subsets might indirectly affect dependency scope.

For Refactor: While there's talk about converting files and generating objects, it doesn't explicitly factor out common responsibilities; the process is more about configuration than refactoring code structure.

For Abstract Common Services: The text does not indicate creating abstract services for similar functionalities. It focuses on binding specific UMLS subsets to the linker.

For Component Replacement: This tactic involves replacing a component with another at build time, but the text describes using local files and configurations without mentioning replacement of components.

For Compile-time Parameterization: The actions described (converting MRCONSO.RFF file, generating KnowledgeBase object) are not done at compile time; they involve runtime steps like training or configuration during startup.

For Aspects: No aspect-oriented programming techniques are mentioned in the text. It's about standard software modifications and configurations.

For Configuration-time Binding: The user suggests binding by using a UMLS license, which is set up via MetamorphoSys help files and UTS website links. This fits with configuration-time binding as defined, where values are bound at deployment time through config.

For Resource Files: Converting the MRCONSO.RFF file to JSON could be seen as creating or using a resource file for data binding purposes during initialization.

For Runtime Registration: The text mentions training a new linker which is done at runtime, but it doesn't specify registration of services dynamically; instead, it's about configuration and setup steps.

For Dynamic Lookup: No mention of dynamic service discovery through APIs or external systems like registries. It's more static binding via files.

For Interpret Parameters: The process involves generating a KnowledgeBase object from the file, which might be interpreted as parameters being handled at runtime for binding values.

For Startup Time Binding: Generating the KnowledgeBase and training the linker are steps that occur during startup or initialization of the tool, aligning with this tactic's definition.

For Name Servers: No use of name servers for service discovery is mentioned in the text. It relies on file-based configurations.

For Plug-ins: The text does not describe using plug-in mechanisms to load different services; it's about direct configuration changes.

For Publish-Subscribe: There's no discussion of event-driven communication or decoupling through messaging patterns, so this tactic doesn't apply.

For Shared Repositories: No mention of shared data stores being used for binding values at runtime. The focus is on local file usage and model training.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

",The user is attempting to train a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for SpaCy's en_core_sci_lg pipeline by freezing other components during training. They adapted a script from Explosion but encountered an incompatibility warning due to different versions of spaCy.,"The text describes the user's effort to train a NER model while keeping other pipeline components frozen, likely aiming to reduce errors or improve performance compatibility by isolating changes and using existing scripts. The error indicates potential issues with version incompatibility affecting system stability.","For Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules into smaller ones; it focuses on freezing components during training. No Match.

For Increase Semantic Coherence: There is no discussion about moving responsibilities to different modules or reducing side effects through better module organization. No Match.

For Encapsulate: The user freezes other pipeline components, which could be seen as restricting dependencies by isolation, but the tactic definition requires an explicit interface for reduction of propagation changes. Not a strong match.

For Use an Intermediary: No mention of breaking dependencies with an intermediary like a mediator or facade pattern. No Match.

For Restrict Dependencies: The user freezes other pipeline components during training, which implies restricting interactions to prevent change propagation. This aligns with the goal of reducing coupling by limiting dependencies in this specific context (during training). However, it is not explicitly stated as using visibility or authorization mechanisms but rather through freezing functionality. It could be a form of restriction.

For Refactor: The text does not mention factoring out common responsibilities from modules; instead, they are adapting a script and freezing components. No Match.

For Abstract Common Services: There is no indication that similar services were implemented in an abstract form to reduce modification costs. They are using existing pipelines without creating abstractions for shared services during training. No Match.

Defer Binding tactics:
Abstract Common Services (already covered above) - Not applicable.

Component Replacement: The user freezes other pipeline components, which is the opposite of replacing them; they are keeping them static while only training NER. Also, freezing might be done by not changing or retraining those modules, but it doesn't involve binding through replacement as in build scripts. No Match.

Compile-time Parameterization: There is no mention of parameterizing at compile time using build tools or scripts that affect the model structure during training. The error and process are about runtime execution with specific models. No Match.

Aspects: Not mentioned, and aspects typically involve compile-time weaving for cross-cutting concerns, not freezing components during training in this context. No Match.

Configuration-time Binding: They adapted a script to generate a config file that enables only NER training while freezing everything else. This could be seen as binding values (like which components are frozen) at configuration time by specifying the config file content. However, it's not clear if they are using this for version compatibility or other bindings; the error is about model incompatibility with spaCy versions.

Restrict Dependencies: Already evaluated above under Reduce Coupling tactics.

Refactor: Already covered.

Increase Semantic Coherence: Not applicable here.

Split Module: No, not mentioned.

Freeze components during training - This might be a form of configuration-time binding if the config file explicitly sets which parts are frozen. But it's more about runtime behavior (only NER is trained) rather than compile-time or deployment time binding for values. The error message suggests that freezing other components doesn't necessarily solve version compatibility issues.

Resource Files: No mention of using resource files to bind values at startup or initialization. No Match.

Runtime Registration: Not mentioned, and they are not registering services dynamically during training; the config file is used which might be static binding for component roles. No Match.

Dynamic Lookup: Not applicable; no runtime dynamic service discovery is described. The freezing of components seems more like a configuration choice than dynamic lookup.

Interpret Parameters: They adapted a script to generate a config, but there's no indication that parameters are being interpreted at runtime during the training process for binding values. No Match.

Startup Time Binding: This could be relevant if they bind values (like component configurations) at startup using resource files or similar mechanisms. The freezing of other components might be set via configuration file which is used at startup, but it's not clear what exactly is being bound and how the binding happens during initialization. However, the config file generation suggests a setup for binding.

Name Servers: Not mentioned; no use of name servers for runtime binding in this context. No Match.

Plug-ins: They are using existing pipeline components (en_core_sci_lg) without adding plug-in mechanisms to defer binding during training. The freezing is part of the config, not a plugin-based approach. No Match.

Publish-Subscribe: Not applicable; no messaging pattern or event-driven binding described in the text for component interactions. No Match.

Shared Repositories: Not mentioned; they are using separate models and pipelines without shared runtime repositories for binding values during training. The freezing is specific to components, not a general repository sharing. No Match.

Polymorphism: They might be using polymorphic behavior in the NER model or other parts if different versions can handle it, but there's no explicit mention of using inheritance or interfaces for runtime binding based on type. Also, the error is about version compatibility, which isn't directly addressed by polymorphism here. No Match.

Defer Binding tactics evaluation summary:
Component Replacement: Not a match because they are not replacing components at compile time; freezing might be seen as static configuration but it's during training, and replacement typically involves build scripts.

Compile-time Parameterization: Not applicable; no parameterization at compile time mentioned.

Aspects: No match.

Configuration-time Binding: There is a possibility of matching if we consider the config file generation. The user generated a config file that specifies which components are frozen (only NER) and what to train, effectively binding the training configuration at deployment or startup time by using this custom config. This could be seen as Configuration-time Binding.

But note: The error is about model version compatibility with spaCy, not necessarily about freezing other components causing an issue. However, based on the text alone, we can only see that they are binding which part to train via configuration file at startup time (when running the training). So it's a form of Configuration-time Binding.

Runtime Registration: No match.

Dynamic Lookup: Not applicable.

Interpret Parameters: No match.

Startup Time Binding: The config file is used during initialization, so binding happens at startup. This could be Startup Time Binding or Configuration-time Binding depending on the definition's source time.

Given that the text says they generated a config file and then saved to output directory (which might be for deployment), it seems more like configuration-time binding as per the available tactics list.

But let's recheck: The tactic 'Configuration-time Binding' is defined under Defer Binding category. It states: ""Binding values at deployment time through configuration."" In this case, they are generating a config file that specifies freezing other components during training. This config file might be used when deploying the model for training (i.e., starting the training process). So it's binding at deployment time.

Similarly, 'Resource Files' is under Defer Binding and involves binding values from resource files at startup or initialization time. But they are not using resource files; they generated a config file which might be considered as configuration data.

So based on the text, Configuration-time Binding seems to fit if we interpret that the freezing of other components is done via configuration (the custom config file) during deployment/startup.",Configuration-time Binding,"The user generated a config file specifically for training purposes that freezes all pipeline components except NER, which aligns with the Defer Binding category tactic 'Configuration-time Binding' as it binds values at deployment time through configuration to control component interactions during runtime.",None,None

- Split Module: The text does not mention refining or splitting any module into smaller parts.
- Increase Semantic Coherence: There is no indication of moving responsibilities to different modules for reducing side effects.
- Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction is described, though the component addition might imply some encapsulation.
- Use an Intermediary: Not mentioned; there's no intermediary breaking dependencies.
- Restrict Dependencies: The text does not discuss restricting which modules interact with others.
- Refactor: While common services are abstracted in general (as per tactic definition), the specific example doesn't show factoring out responsibilities. It describes adding a pipe and configuration, but no explicit refactoring is mentioned.
- Abstract Common Services: This might be applicable as similar services could be implemented once in an abstract form to reduce modification costs, though not directly stated for this text.
- Component Replacement: Not used; the component is added dynamically without replacing existing ones.
- Compile-time Parameterization: The configuration parameter `extended=True` is set at runtime or during initialization, not compile time.
- Aspects: No aspect-based approach mentioned.
- Configuration-time Binding: The binding of values (like extended patterns) can be done via the config passed to add_pipe, which might be considered as configuration-time if it's part of deployment setup. However, in this context, it seems more like a parameter set during component addition.
- Resource Files: Not mentioned; no resource files are used for binding.
- Runtime Registration: The `add_pipe` method with config allows setting parameters at runtime or initialization time, which could be seen as runtime registration/binding.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Text To Analyze:
""Download to temporary file, then copy to cache dir once finished. Otherwise you get corrupt cache entries if the download gets interrupted.""
",The text describes a method for handling partial or failed downloads by saving data temporarily before moving it to a permanent cache directory.,"The goal is to ensure that cached files are complete and valid, preventing corruption due to incomplete operations.","Evaluating each tactic:
- Ping/Echo: Not mentioned or relevant; the text does not describe asynchronous reachability checks.
- Monitor: No explicit monitoring mechanism described in the text. The focus is on handling failures during download, not ongoing health checks.
- Heartbeat: Periodic message exchange for fault detection isn't referenced in the text.
- Timestamp: Not used to detect incorrect sequences or assign time stamps to events as per the tactic definition.
- Sanity Checking: No validity checks of operations or outputs are mentioned. The text is about handling incomplete downloads, not checking their correctness.
- Condition Monitoring: This involves preventing faulty behavior by monitoring conditions. However, no specific condition monitoring for download processes is described in the text.
- Voting: Not applicable; there's no mention of multiple components voting on an output.
- Exception Detection: The tactic requires detection of exceptions to handle them. In this text, exception handling isn't discussed or defined as part of a fault management system.
- Self-Test: No self-testing procedures for the download component are mentioned in the text.

Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair:
- Active Redundancy: Not relevant; no parallel processing with identical inputs is described.
- Passive Redundancy: Doesn't involve redundant spares or state updates, so not a match.
- Spare: The tactic refers to cold sparing where spares are out of service until fail-over. In the text, there's no mention of having spare components in shadow mode or otherwise.
- Exception Handling: This is about masking faults after detection. However, the text does not describe any mechanism for handling exceptions; it only mentions copying once finished and avoiding corruption if interrupted.
- Rollback: Reverting to a previous state isn't mentioned here. The text talks about temporary files but doesn't reference reverting operations.
- Software Upgrade: Not related to upgrades or in-service changes, so no match.
- Retry: The tactic involves retrying an operation for transient faults. In the text, there's no mention of retrying; it only says to copy once finished if not interrupted.
- Ignore Faulty Behavior: This is about ignoring spurious messages from a source. Not applicable here as the issue isn't with faulty behavior but incomplete operations.
- Degradation: Dropping less critical functions upon failure isn't described in this text.
- Reconfiguration: No reassigning responsibilities to other resources for recovery, so not relevant.

Recover from Faults_Reintroduction:
- Shadow: Not mentioned; no shadow mode operation is described.
- State Resynchronization: The tactic involves bringing failed components back into sync. In the text, there's no failure or need to synchronize states after a fault.
- Escalating Restart: No varying restart granularity for recovery purposes in this context.

Prevent Faults:
- Removal from Service: Not mentioned; no temporary disabling of components is described.
- Transactions: The tactic ensures atomicity and consistency. In the text, there's an implied sequence (download then copy) that should be completed without interruption to prevent corruption. This resembles a transactional approach where partial operations are avoided.
- Predictive Model: Not used for predicting future faults; no monitoring or model is mentioned.
- Exception Prevention: The tactic aims to stop exceptions from happening. In the text, by ensuring the download completes before copying, they are preventing corrupt cache entries which could be an exception condition.
- Increase Competence Set: Expanding operational states isn't relevant here as the focus is on a specific operation sequence.

Thus, after evaluating all tactics, only 'Transactions' and 'Exception Prevention' have some applicability. However, 'Transactions' (ensuring atomicity) seems more directly applicable because it implies that the download and copy operations are treated as an indivisible unit to prevent partial updates or corruption. The text does not explicitly describe a transaction mechanism but suggests one by requiring completion before proceeding.

Therefore, I will select 'Exception Prevention' as the best fit since the tactic is about preventing exceptions (corrupt cache entries) from occurring in the first place.",Exception Prevention,"The text describes a method to prevent corrupt cache entries by ensuring that downloads are complete before copying, which aligns with the definition of Exception Prevention as techniques employed to stop system exceptions from occurring.",None,None

For Increase Semantic Coherence: There's no mention of moving responsibilities or reducing side effects, so No Match.
For Encapsulate: The text discusses managing model dependencies during upgrades but doesn't introduce an explicit interface for scispacy itself. It focuses on version compatibility and installation methods, which is more about dependency restriction than encapsulation. So No Match.
For Use an Intermediary: Not mentioned in the text; it talks about direct model download or pip install from URLs without intermediaries. No Match.
For Restrict Dependencies: The text emphasizes downloading models compatible with scispacy's version, which restricts dependencies by ensuring correct versions are used. This is a form of dependency restriction at configuration time (via installation). There might be an implicit match here as the system ensures that only appropriate models are installed for given scispacy versions.
For Refactor: The text does not mention refactoring code or moving common responsibilities, so No Match.

For Configuration-time Binding: This involves binding values during deployment configuration. The text instructs users to download models compatible with their scispacy version, which is a form of configuration (installation) time binding for model versions and dependencies.

For Interpret Parameters: Not mentioned; no interpretation of parameters for model versions during runtime. No Match.
For Startup Time Binding: The text mentions that after upgrading scispacy, users need to download models again (during setup or upgrade).

","The text describes an action of retraining models for compatibility with a specific version (spacy 2.2.1) and rewriting a sentence splitting pipe to use pysbd, which is noted as experimental.",The goal appears to be ensuring model compatibility with existing systems (specifically spacy 2.2.1) and introducing an alternative implementation for the sentence splitting functionality that might offer better performance or flexibility but comes with a note about its experimental nature.,"For each tactic, I will analyze if it applies based on the text.

**Discover Service**: This tactic involves locating services through a directory at runtime. The text mentions retraining models and rewriting a pipe to use pysbd, which is an external library but does not describe searching or using a directory service for discovery. It's about compatibility and implementation change, so this doesn't match the definition of Discover Service.

**Orchestrate**: This tactic uses a control mechanism to coordinate multiple services that might be unaware of each other. The text talks about retraining models (which could imply coordinating different components) but does not mention any coordination or control mechanism between services. It's focused on making changes for compatibility, so this doesn't match.

**Tailor Interface**: This tactic involves modifying interfaces by adding capabilities like translation or buffering. The text mentions rewriting a pipe to use pysbd and retraining models for compatibility with spacy 2.2.1. However, it does not explicitly state that an interface is being tailored (e.g., changing its behavior, hiding functions). It's more about adapting the model and functionality rather than directly modifying interfaces as per this tactic definition.",None,"No architectural tactic from the provided list strongly matches the described actions of retraining models for compatibility and rewriting a pipe to use an experimental library, as none of the tactics (Discover Service, Orchestse, Tailor Interface) are directly referenced or implied by these activities.",None,None

""Pin scispacy to 2.1.x; The current models are not compatible with spacy 2.2. Pinning the scispacy version until we can upgrade to 2.2 and release new models.""
","The text describes pinning a specific library (scispacy) to an older version (2.1.x) due to compatibility issues, while waiting for newer versions of dependent components.",This addresses the issue of preventing errors or ensuring stability by maintaining backward compatibility through dependency management.,"For Split Module: The text does not mention splitting modules, so No Match.
For Increase Semantic Coherence: There is no discussion about moving responsibilities between modules to reduce side effects; it's about version pinning. So No Match.
For Encapsulate: No explicit interface introduction or dependency encapsulation mentioned in the text. No Match.
For Use an Intermediary: The text does not describe breaking dependencies with an intermediary like a façade or proxy. No Match.
For Restrict Dependencies: While version pinning restricts which versions are used, it is more about specifying compatibility than restricting module interactions broadly. However, the tactic definition focuses on modules that interact, and this text doesn't specify such restrictions in terms of module interfaces. It's a form of dependency management but not matching the core idea of encapsulation or explicit boundaries. No Match.
For Refactor: The action described is pinning a version to avoid issues until new models are released, which does not align with refactoring (improving code structure without changing behavior). No Match.
For Abstract Common Services: This involves creating abstract services for reuse, but the text is about preventing compatibility issues by fixing one component's version. Not applicable. No Match.
For Component Replacement: The tactic definition says binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in scripts or makefiles. Pinning a library version might be done via configuration files (like requirements.txt) rather than direct replacement, and it doesn't bind the value for future use but restricts current usage. However, pinning is often considered a form of dependency management that can involve specifying versions in build tools. But the text does not explicitly mention build scripts or makefile replacements. It's more about configuration. No Match.
For Compile-time Parameterization: This binds values at compile time by parameterizing code (e.g., generics). The text is about pinning a library version, which is typically done via dependency management tools and configurations, not through code parameterization. Not applicable. No Match.
For Aspects**: Aspect-oriented programming is mentioned but the text does not use aspects for binding values at compile time or build time. No Match.
For Configuration-time Binding: This tactic involves binding values at deployment time through configuration (e.g., config files). Pinning a library version in requirements.txt or similar might be considered configuration-time, as it's set during setup before runtime. However, the text does not explicitly mention configuration files for this purpose; it just says pinning until upgrade is possible. But if we consider that specifying the pinned version in dependency files (like pipfile or package.json) happens at deployment time, then there might be a match. Let's analyze: The action of 'pinning' typically involves setting a fixed version during project setup or deployment configuration. Since the text says ""until we can upgrade"", it implies this is set now and will change later, fitting the description of binding values (the scisp",None,The text describes pinning library versions to maintain compatibility with existing models until upgrades are available.
