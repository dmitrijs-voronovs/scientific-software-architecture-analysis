You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

7," in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
 in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended!

15,"This is similar to issue 191 but I think there is an additional thing going on. The given adapter *is* trimmed from the reads, but since fastp assumes everything is a 3 adapter, it has no way of knowing you may want to keep things 3 of the adapter sequence (and remove things 5 of that sequence). All the reads contain the adapter within 15 bases, so when fastp trims the adapter (and downstream sequence), the remaining 15mers are thrown out. . I would argue that 5 adapter trimming is probably the only feature fastp is missing to make it the ultimate trimming tool. The additional thing here is that the two reads that remain contain a bit of the Illumina adapter at the 3 end, which fastp trims. It appears that fastp considers trimming complete when it finds that one sequence. **Is this the expected behavior?** I think it would make more sense to find the adapter that trims the largest portion of the read, or at least make greedy adapter trimming an option. Cutadapt enables this by an option to do repeated adapter trimming on each read (option `-n` I think).","

**Content to analyze:**
This is similar to issue 191 but I think there is an additional thing going on. The given adapter *is* trimmed from the reads, but since fastp assumes everything is a 3 adapter, it has no way of knowing you may want to keep things 3 of the adapter sequence (and remove things 5 of that sequence). All the reads contain the adapter within 15 bases, so when fastp trims the adapter (and downstream sequence), the remaining 15mers are thrown out. . I would argue that 5 adapter trimming is probably the only feature fastp is missing to make it the ultimate trimming tool. The additional thing here is that the two reads that remain contain a bit of the Illumina adapter at the 3 end, which fastp trims. It appears that fastp considers trimming complete when it finds that one sequence. **Is this the expected behavior?** I think it would make more sense to find the adapter that trims the largest portion of the read, or at least make greedy adapter trimming an option. Cutadapt enables this by an option to do repeated adapter trimming on each read (option `-n` I think).
",False,"This text contains a detailed explanation about the behavior of fastp and how it compares to other tools like Cutadapt, discussing specific issues such as incomplete adapter removal and suggesting improvements. It explains 'why' certain features might be missing in fastp and provides context for potential changes, which aligns with Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations."

It would be amazing to have a tool that does adapters, quality AND stitching!","

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.

- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

7,"Switch t-SNE in scanpy to openTSNE; I'm not sure what t-SNE implementation is currently used in scanpy, but would it make sense to switch it to openTSNE? It's a Cython re-implementation of FIt-SNE, it's available on conda and should be very easy to depend on. As far as I understand the scanpy architecture, it builds a kNN graph and then runs downstream analysis (like UMAP or Louvain) on this kNN graph. Is that right? I suppose this is currently not implemented for t-SNE? With openTSNE it'd be easy to use the pre-built kNN graph and run t-SNE directly on that. Also, the default parameters of t-SNE in scanpy could IMHO be improved, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. Some of these recommendations (learning rate, initialization) are now default in openTSNE. There are some open issues at scanpy related to t-SNE such as https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/1150 and https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/996 but I think this suggestion would supersede them. We had a brief discussion of this at openTSNE here https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102. I can see four somewhat separate suggestions:. 1. switch scanpy to using openTSNE for tSNE, using already constructed kNN graph. 2. add tSNE support for `ingest` using openTSNE functionality. 3. change default tSNE parameters (n_iter, learning rate, initialization) following openTSNE defaults. 4. add some tSNE recipes based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. What of this, if any, makes sense from the scanpy point of view?","

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
Switch t-SNE in scanpy to openTSNE; I'm not sure what t-SNE implementation is currently used in scanpy, but would it make sense to switch it to openTSNE? It's a Cython re-implementation of FIt-SNE, it's available on conda and should be very easy to depend on. As far as I understand the scanpy architecture, it builds a kNN graph and then runs downstream analysis (like UMAP or Louvain) on this kNN graph. Is that right? I suppose this is currently not implemented for t-SNE? With openTSNE it'd be easy to use the pre-built kNN graph and run t-SNE directly on that. Also, the default parameters of t-SNE in scanpy could IMHO be improved, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. Some of these recommendations (learning rate, initialization) are now default in openTSNE. There are some open issues at scanpy related to t-SNE such as https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/1150 and https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/996 but I think this suggestion would supersede them. We had a brief discussion of this at openTSNE here https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102. I can see four somewhat separate suggestions:. 1. switch scanpy to using openTSNE for tSNE, using already constructed kNN graph. 2. add tSNE support for `ingest` using openTSNE functionality. 3. change default tSNE parameters (n_iter, learning rate, initialization) following openTSNE defaults. 4. add some tSNE recipes based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x. What of this, if any, makes sense from the scanpy point of view?
",False,"This text contains a detailed explanation and discussion about switching t-SNE implementation in Scanpy to openTSNE. It explains the rationale behind considering this change (e.g., availability on conda, ease of dependency), discusses the current architecture, potential benefits, references external papers and issues, and outlines multiple suggestions with analysis. The content is clearly a human communicating technical ideas and design considerations to another human, providing substantial explanatory value about 'why' and 'how'. Therefore, it should be kept based on Principle #1."
