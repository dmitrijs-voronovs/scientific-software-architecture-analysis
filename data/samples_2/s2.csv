6,"When you refer to the method GATK has to incorporate known variants for quality control, I believe that you are referring to VQSR (variant quality score recalibrator). You are correct that this requires a set of ground truth information. It seems likely to me that VQSR and similar systems would not behave correctly on bacterial data even if ground truth were available. To understand whether events are false positives or real SNPs, I think you will want to get some orthogonal measure of whether they are accurate. It probably makes sense to look at the reads data for some of these sites in a tool like IGV to get a feel for whether they look reliable or not. One nice thing about DeepVariant is that the quality scores for variants calls are generally normally distributed and predict the human variant quality confidence quite well. One approach you can take is to see what the distribution of DeepVariant quality scores is for the variants you know are real and see whether the new variants have a similar confidence distribution.","### Data for Evaluation

3,"--cut_by_quality3/5 description is confusing; We've been investigating how the --cut_by_quality trimming actually works. Two other issues (#24 and 65) had the same questions we have, and your answers to those were not detailed enough and neither is the description in the documentation. I'll try to spell out my confusion clearly... The --cut_by_quality documentation references Trimmomatic and sliding window but it does not work the same way Trimmomatic's SLIDINGWINDOW option works, which is where I think a lot of the confusion comes from. Instead, --cut_by_quality works more similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING options, except it uses a minimum window size of 2 instead of single bases like L/T. Both --cut_by_quality and L/T stop when reaching a window or base above the quality threshold. However, SLIDINGWINDOW slides down the entire sequence and can find low-quality windows in the middle of otherwise high-quality sequence and will discard the rest of the sequence starting at the low-quality window. This is why SLIDINGWINDOW should only be used after LEADING trimming, else the entire sequence that starts with a few low-quality bases would be lost. At the very least, would you please change the documentation for --cut_by_quality to specifically state that it works similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING trimming, not SLIDINGWINDOW? I would also like to request that the minimum window size be allowed to be 1 so we could use it as a single base trimmer. Finally, a further enhancement would be to include an option that does work like SLIDINGWINDOW. Thanks for an otherwise great software tool - we are really pleased with our testing overall and are close to switching to fastp for our production work!","### Data for Evaluation

8," restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade compression. If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd. Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see below). Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END. If not enough output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must be called again as described above. deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read so far (that is, total_in bytes). deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT).

This is controlled by the flag `--alt_aligned_pileup`. `--alt_aligned_pileup=diff_channels` is now [default for DeepVariant PacBio model](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.0/docs/deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md). This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. . * Added new flag `--sort_by_haplotypes` to optionally allow creating pileup images with reads sorted by haplotype. Haplotype sorting is based on the HP tag that must be present in input BAM, and `--parse_sam_aux_fields` needs to be set as well. This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. * The PacBio case study now includes instructions for two-pass calling, which allows users to take advantage of the `--sort_by_haplotypes` by phasing variants and the input reads. Accuracy metrics for both single pass calling and two-pass calling are shown. Users may choose whether to run a second time for higher accuracy. * Default of `--min_mapping_quality` in make_examples.py changed from 10 to 5.

0,"the deflate stream. The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed data from that block has been written to strm->next_out. The number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than eight. data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently consumed input in bits. The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the end of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that block is decoded. This allows the caller to determine the length of the deflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block. 256 is added to the value of strm->data_type when inflate() returns immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header. inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the operation to complete. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved by the compressor for this purpose.) The use of Z_FINISH is not required to perform an inflation in one step. However it may be used to inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate() call. Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint. If the stream does not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not enough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and inflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had been used.

1,"el on a large corpus of citations using this objective, encouraging it to output representations that are more similar for papers that share a citation link than for those that do not. Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SCIDOCS, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark. As the pace of scientific publication continues to increase, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools that help users to search, discover and understand the scientific literature have become critical. In recent years, substantial improvements in NLP tools have been brought about by pretrained neural language models (LMs) (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). While such models are widely used for representing individual words ∗ Equal contribution 1 https://github.com/allenai/specter or sentences, extensions to whole-document embeddings are relatively underexplored.

2,"Payload Management APIs (Cloned from absl::Status) A payload may be attached to a status to provide additional context to an error that may not be satisfied by an existing `tsl::error::Code`. Typically, this payload serves one of several purposes: It may provide more fine-grained semantic information about the error to facilitate actionable remedies. It may provide human-readable contexual information that is more appropriate to display to an end user. A payload consists of a [key,value] pair, where the key is a string referring to a unique type URL and the value is an object of type `absl::Cord` to hold the contextual data. The type URL should be unique and follow the format of a URL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) and, ideally, provide some documentation or schema on how to interpret its associated data. For example, the default type URL for a protobuf message type is type.googleapis.com/packagename.messagename"". Other custom wire formats should define the format of type URL in a similar practice so as to minimize the chance of conflict between type URLs. Users should ensure that the type URL can be mapped to a concrete C++ type if they want to deserialize the payload and read it effectively. To attach a payload to a status object, call `Status::SetPayload()`, passing it the type URL and an `absl::Cord` of associated data. Similarly, to extract the payload from a status, call `Status::GetPayload()`. You may attach multiple payloads (with differing type URLs) to any given status object, provided that the status is currently exhibiting an error code (i.e. is not OK).

12,"inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back interface for input and output. This is potentially more efficient than inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer. inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large buffers. inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns. inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer. inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw deflate stream with each call. inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the allocated state. A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write ","### Data for Evaluation

The one-step script whose usage is shown in https://github.com/google/deepvariant#how-to-run-deepvariant will work on a cluster, just note that giving it something like 64 threads will help it run faster. Our case study [metrics](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.1/docs/metrics.md) are from runs with 64 CPU cores and no GPU, so those numbers should give you an idea if that works for your purposes. For the simple run_deepvariant case, if Docker isn't available to you on your cluster, the same container and commands can be used with Singularity. This is I think what most people do when running on a cluster. If you really want to optimize a process to run DeepVariant many times, it can be worth running the 3 stages separately and giving them different resources because make_examples wants many CPUs, call_variants runs faster on GPUs, and postprocess_variants really just needs 1 CPU.

22,"apsulation. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

New documentation:. * Added [a tutorial for merging WES trio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md). * Added recommended GLnexus parameters for merging [WGS](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/deepvariant/cohort_best_practice/DeepVariantWGS_v1.yml) and [WES](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/deepvariant/cohort_best_practice/DeepVariantWES_v1.yml) data (also available as built-in presets in GLnexus v1.2.2+). * Visualization functionality and documentation: [VCF stats report](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/deepvariant-vcf-stats-report.md). Changes to Docker images, code, and models:. * Docker images now live in Docker Hub [google/deepvariant](https://hub.docker.com/r/google/deepvariant) in addition to gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant. . * For WES, added 100bps buffer to the capture regions when creating training examples. * For WES, increased training examples with lower coverage exomes, down to 30x. * For PACBIO, added training data for Sequel II v2 chemistry and samples processed with CCS v4 algorithm. * Loosened the restriction that the BAM files need to have exactly one sample_name. Now if there are multiple samples in the header, use the first one. If there was none, use a default. * Changes in realigner code. Realigner aligns reads to haplotypes first and then realigns them to the reference. With this change some of the haplotypes (with not enough read support) are now discarded. This results in fewer reads needing to be realigned. Theoretically, this fix should improve FP rate. It also helps to resolve [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/209).

This flag allows the merging of adjacent records that. all have GQ values within a bin of the given size, and for each record emits the. minimum GQ value seen within the bin. For example, setting `--gvcf_gq_binsize 5` has the effect that adjacent records. with GQ=0; GQ in [1, 5]; GQ in [6, 10]; GQ in [11, 15]; etc. are binned. together.

This assures that enough bytes are output in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed code block. If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to seven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after the next deflate block is completed. In this case, the decompressor may not be provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of the data provided so far to the compressor. It may need to wait for the next block to be emitted. This is for advanced applications that need to control the emission of deflate blocks. If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade compression. If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error.

When using the zlib format, this function must be called immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or deflateReset, and before any call of deflate.

The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary). The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than with the default empty dictionary. Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size provided in deflateInit or deflateInit2. Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front. In addition, the current implementation of deflate will use at most the window size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

18,"Induction of cytokine expression in leukocytes by binding of thrombin-stimulated platelets. BACKGROUND: Activated platelets tether and activate myeloid leukocytes. To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased. Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta, IL-8, and MCP-1 in leukocytes. Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI.","### Data for Evaluation

2,"25763772|t|DCTN4 as a modifier of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis. 25763772|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is associated with worse long-term pulmonary disease and shorter survival, and chronic Pa infection (CPA) is associated with reduced lung function, faster rate of lung decline, increased rates of exacerbations and shorter survival. By using exome sequencing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06).

20," proto and associated other protos provide additional details. The AlleleCount's generated by adding each read simply sum up independently with multiple reads, which is a very attractive property of the AlleleCount representation. Note that this code can diverge from the left-alignment requirement of VCF / variant protos when the input read cigars are themselves not left aligned. For example, suppose we have: ref: TAAAC sample: TAAC Ideally an aligner would place the DELETION cigar elements for any read covering this site to the left-most position: ref: TAAAC read1: T-AAC [cigar = 1M1D3M, ideal] read2: TA-AC [cigar = 2M1D2M, pretty far from ideal, but equivalent] This code doesn't try to do anything clever by left-aligning CIGAR elements in order to fix this problem. This is largely ok because (1) the standard aligner (BWA) does in fact do consistent left alignment and (2) we anticipate feeding this AlleleCounter reads that have been assembled into a consistent alignment across all of the reads in a way that is impossible for a read-by- read aligner to do. So beware with the aligner you use, unless you've cleaned up the reads in some way (left aligning the cigars or just doing assembly). It is ok to send reads that only partially overlap the interval; the AlleleCounter will only add counts from the part that overlap the interval. This code assumes that the reference genome and the reads have only upper case bases. By construction our GenomeReference will not have lower case bases. Lower case bases are allowed in read sequences (see https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), so it may be worth upper casing the read sequence at some point to make this code more robust. AlleleCounter performs some specialized logic to deal with non-canonical bases that might occur in the reference and/or the reads. By canonical we mean bases that are one of {A,C,G,T}. The basic constraint is that we will not add Allele's that con","### Data for Evaluation

DeepVariant is an analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call. genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. While. DeepVariant is highly accurate for. [many types of NGS data](https://rdcu.be/7Dhl), some users may be interested in. training custom deep learning models that have been optimized for very specific. data. This case study describes one way to train such a custom model using a GPU, in. this case for BGISEQ-500 data. Please note that there is not yet a production-grade training pipeline. This is. just one example of how to train a custom model, and is neither the fastest nor. the cheapest possible configuration. The resulting model also does not represent. the greatest achievable accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data. High level summary of result. We demonstrated that by training on 1 replicate of BGISEQ-500 whole genome data. (everything except for chromosome 20-22), we can significantly improve the. accuracy comparing to the WGS model as a baseline:. * Indel F1 `94.1615%` --> `98.1937%`. * SNP F1: `99.8785%` --> `99.9042%`. This tutorial is meant as an example for training; all the other processing in. this tutorial were done serially with no pipeline optimization. Request a machine. For this case study, we use a [GPU machine] with 16 vCPUs.

If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

The Phred algorithm would trim the last 6 bases, because their average quality (calculated by summing the error probabilities) is 2.79, which is below 10.

12,"Thank you very much @pgrosu for such detailed answer! You are absolutely right. So, @amy-houseman, in summary, if a candidate variant passes all of the VSC's (very sensitive caller) thresholds and then the neural network prediction is confident on the genotype, `post_processing` will assign a PASS to the variant. One more thing to note, we train DeepVariant at several downsampled coverages so the model can capture the coverage variability of regions and different sequencing runs. This also makes DeepVariant robust to different coverages. Hopefully that answers your question. . @pgrosu, again thank you for such detailed and excellent answer.

1,"h is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd. Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see below). Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END. If not enough output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must be called again as described above. deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read so far (that is, total_in bytes). deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT). In doubt, the data is considered binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect the compression algorithm in any manner. deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero).

The primary use of this function is to get a subset of tf.Variables from a slim-defined model that we'd like to restore from a checkpoint. The checkpoint generally contains all of the variables in the graph during training, including things like the backprop variables, moving averages for visualization, etc. Simply restoring all of those variables is brittle, as we often want to start a new training run, maybe using a different optimizer, different visualization variables, or replacing part of the model with a new classification layer, as unneeded variables from the checkpoint get loaded into the graph and/or new TF variables not present in the graph cannot be found, raising exceptions. This function allows a clean API to get just the *model* variables from a graph, excluding all of those non-model variables, along with optionally removing parts of the model graph via exclude scopes. This function calls slim.get_model_variables() to get the raw list of all variables associated with the MODEL_VARIABLES collection. It then filters away all variables that match any of the scopes in exclude_scopes. For example, suppose we have a model with three variables with names: w1 = model/l1/weight1 w2 = model/l2/weight2 w3 = model/l2/weight3 Without any exclude scopes, we would return these three variables [w1, w2, and w3]. Providing exclude_scopes=['model/l2'] would return only [w1], while exclude_scopes=['model/l1'] would return [w2, w3]. Args: exclude_scopes: None, or a list of strings.

A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1]. out() should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure. If out() returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error. Neither in() nor out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from. The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by in().

If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one.

9,"fix average q-score calculation; Hi, big fan of your work! . In this pull request, I rewrote the --average_qual method to accurately calculate the average quality of a read. I was running .fastq files of DNA sequenced on our Nanopore through fastp (Nanopore says to use average read q-scores), and way more reads were passing the quality filter than I was used to. I looked into it, and fastp was averaging the q-scores, which are log values, and not taking the q-score out of log scale to p values before averaging. This results in way more reads passing the filter than there should be. As an example: . . A base with a q-score of 10 and a second base with a q-score of 20, if . averaged, would have an average q-score of 15. However, if you average the probability of errors: . A q-score of 10 is a probability of error of 0.1. A q-score of 20 is a probability of error of 0.01. Averaging the probability of error: 0.1 + 0.01 = 0.11 | 0.11 / 2 = 0.055. The q-score for a probability of error of 0.055 is ~12.5. . This number accurately reflects the average amount of error present in the read. To implement this, in the filter.cpp file, I changed the totalQual variable to a float. I then had the totalQual variable increment by the probability of error instead of the q-score. Then, in the else if statement, I divided the final totalQual value of the read by the rlen, and calculated the resulting q-score to compare to the users input. I complied the code and tested it on a simulated dataset, and the results were identical to the other nanopore quailty filtering packages I have on my machine. Thanks again for fastp!!","### Data for Evaluation

When a higher compression level is desired, a larger generic memory buffer needs to be supplied by setting level_buf and level_buf_size to represent the chunk of memory. For level x, the suggest size for this buffer this buffer is ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_DEFAULT. The defines ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_MIN, ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_SMALL, ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_MEDIUM, ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_LARGE, and ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_EXTRA_LARGE are also provided as other suggested sizes. The equivalent of the zlib FLUSH_SYNC operation is currently supported. Flush types can be NO_FLUSH, SYNC_FLUSH or FULL_FLUSH. Default flush type is NO_FLUSH. A SYNC_ OR FULL_ flush will byte align the deflate block by appending an empty stored block once all input has been compressed, including the buffered input. Checking that the out_buffer is not empty or that internal_state.state = ZSTATE_NEW_HDR is sufficient to guarantee all input has been flushed. Additionally FULL_FLUSH will ensure look back history does not include previous blocks so new blocks are fully independent. Switching between flush types is supported. If a compression dictionary is required, the dictionary can be set calling isal_deflate_set_dictionary before calling isal_deflate. If the gzip_flag is set to IGZIP_GZIP, a generic gzip header and the gzip trailer are written around the deflate compressed data.

13,"Trimming for polyA/T/C; improved runtimes for downstream alignment and variant calling; Shifu;. Congrats on the paper in bioRxiv and thanks for all the great work on fastp. We've been working on improving the runtimes for somatic variant calling workflows and exploring quality and polyX trimming. We did a test run with fastp and atropos and found that the major improvements in runtime were due to removal of polyX sequences at the 3 ends of reads:. https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio_validations/tree/master/somatic_trim. We'd used the new polyG trimming functionality (thank you), but a crude method of 3 polyA/T/C adapter removal, which appears to be less effective with fastp compared to atropos trimming. When additional polyX stretches get removed we get much better runtimes for alignment and variant calling. I saw general polyX and low complexity trimming are on the roadmap for fastp and would like to express my support for this. We've been making great use of fastp for adapter conversion and would like to offer trimming as part of an effort to speed up alignment and variant calling both on NovaSeqs and more generally. As a secondary help for integration, is streaming trimming a possibility for paired ends? To help improve preparation runtimes I'd been thinking of including trimming and streaming directly into bwa/minimap2 alignment, or being able to stream outputs into bgzip so we can index and parallelize variant calling.

35," by left-aligning CIGAR elements in order to fix this problem. This is largely ok because (1) the standard aligner (BWA) does in fact do consistent left alignment and (2) we anticipate feeding this AlleleCounter reads that have been assembled into a consistent alignment across all of the reads in a way that is impossible for a read-by- read aligner to do. So beware with the aligner you use, unless you've cleaned up the reads in some way (left aligning the cigars or just doing assembly). It is ok to send reads that only partially overlap the interval; the AlleleCounter will only add counts from the part that overlap the interval. This code assumes that the reference genome and the reads have only upper case bases. By construction our GenomeReference will not have lower case bases. Lower case bases are allowed in read sequences (see https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), so it may be worth upper casing the read sequence at some point to make this code more robust. AlleleCounter performs some specialized logic to deal with non-canonical bases that might occur in the reference and/or the reads. By canonical we mean bases that are one of {A,C,G,T}. The basic constraint is that we will not add Allele's that contain non-canonical bases. So if we have a read that has (e.g.) an N, we will not produce Allele objects that contain the N. So if it doesn't match the reference at a site, it will be skipped as a SUBSTITUTION allele, and if it were part of an insertion, that entire insertion will be skipped. We do support AlleleCount objects that have a N base as its reference base, and those bases get alleles just as a normal base would. Downstream processing should look at the reference base of the AlleleCounts produced by this code for non-canonical reference bases and handle if special handling is needed. Finally, if a read's deletion CIGAR spans across part of the reference genome that has an N, the corresponding DELETION allele will ","### Data for Evaluation

These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended!

However, I noticed some recurrent errors that I want to share with you, since they occur on the aforementioned, widely used BioNLP corpus. I collected many examples that I'm reporting here, and that can be summarized as:. - Oversplitting after +/- or at the dot in p50.c-rel"". - Undersplitting after a capital letter followed by a dot (e.g., kappa B., kinase A., Cya.). You can also find attached a list of other less common errors I screened ([other_errors.txt](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/files/3111859/other_errors.txt)), but I think even just identify a solution for and/or handling these cases would be great since they represent the majority of errors (~75%) in the BioNLP09 corpus! . What would you recommend for handling these cases? Are they easily manageable by adding tokenization rules or you suggest to have a custom module to workaround the problem? Thank you very much indeed! Alan. _____. **Oversplitting after +/-""**. Example 1. - PDBu + iono induced equally high IL-2 levels in both groups and, when stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the IL-2 secretion by neonatal cells was undetectable and adult cells produced low amounts of IL-2 (mean 331 +/-. - 86 pg/ml). Example 2. - The addition of anti-CD28 mAb to anti-CD3-stimulated cells markedly increased IL-2 production in both cell types, but levels of IL-2 in neonatal T cells remained clearly lower than those of adult T cells (respective mean values: 385 ","### Data for Evaluation

So your supporting reads are picked by an allele counter, and it uses them to generate a matrix (image) that gets fed into the model generating the GT and GQ values. The height of these matrices is usually 100 rows. If it is greater it will randomly downsample from these reads, and usually use 95 of them as 5 are used for representing the reference sequence. I'm assuming you've updated the model as denoted in the tutorial and not used the regular WGS one. I know it's obvious, but as noted in the paper there is a difference between a RNA-seq model versus the WGS/WES one provided by DeepVariant.

21,"ion. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For more details on flags, run `/opt/deepvariant/bin/make_examples --help` for more details. * Major refactoring to ensure useful features (such as --add_hp_channel) can be shared between DeepVariant and DeepTrio make_examples. * Add MED_DP (median of DP) in the gVCF output. See [this section](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-gvcf-support.md#new-option-to-include-med-dp) for more details. * New `--split_skip_reads` flag: if True, make_examples will split reads with large SKIP cigar operations into individual reads. Resulting read parts that are less than 15 bp are filtered out. * We now sort the realigned BAM output mentioned in [this section](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/FAQ.md#what-is-the-realigner-and-how-does-it-work) when you use `--emit_realigned_reads=true --realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads` for make_examples. You will still need to run `samtools index` to get the index file, but no longer need to sort the BAM. * Added an experimental prototype for multi-sample make_examples. - This is an experimental prototype for working with multiple samples in DeepVariant, a proof of concept enabled by the refactoring to join together DeepVariant and DeepTrio, generalizing the functionality of make_examples to work with multiple samples. Usage information is in multisample_make_examples.py, but note that this is experimental. * Improved logic for read allele counts calculation for sites with low base quality indels, which resulted in Indel accuracy improvement for PacBio models. * Improvements to the realigner code to ","### Data for Evaluation

The merged reads are also filtered. * `--out1` and `--out2` will be the reads that cannot be merged successfully, but both pass all the filters. * `--unpaired1` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read1` passes filters but `read2` doesn't. * `--unpaired2` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read2` passes filters but `read1` doesn't. * `--include_unmerged` can be enabled to make reads of `--out1`, `--out2`, `--unpaired1` and `--unpaired2` redirected to `--merged_out`. So you will get a single output file. This option is disabled by default. `--failed_out` can still be given to store the reads (either merged or unmerged) failed to passing filters. In the output file, a tag like `merged_xxx_yyy`will be added to each read name to indicate that how many base pairs are from read1 and from read2, respectively. For example, `. @NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15`. means that 150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2. `fastp` prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2.

If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

In particular the GetBases(Range(chrom, start, end)) operation fetches bases from the tuple where chrom == chromosome, and then from the bases where the first base of bases starts at start. If start > 0, then the bases string is assumed to contain bases starting from that position in the region. For example, the record ('1', 10, ACGT') implies that GetBases(ranges.make_range('1', 11, 12)) will return the base C', as the A base is at position 10.

12,"s. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data. * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. . * Added new flag `--sort_by_haplotypes` to optionally allow creating pileup images with reads sorted by haplotype. Haplotype sorting is based on the HP tag that must be present in input BAM, and `--parse_sam_aux_fields` needs to be set as well. This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. * The PacBio case study now includes instructions for two-pass calling, which allows users to take advantage of the `--sort_by_haplotypes` by phasing variants and the input reads. Accuracy metrics for both single pass calling and two-pass calling are shown. Users may choose whether to run a second time for higher accuracy. * Default of `--min_mapping_quality` in make_examples.py changed from 10 to 5. This improves accuracy of all models (WGS, WES, and PACBIO). * Included a new hybrid illumina+pacbio model and documentation. * Added show_examples, a tool for showing examples as pileup image files, with documentation. * Cleaned up unused experimental flags: `--sequencing_type_image` and `--custom_pileup_image`. * Added `--only_keep_pass` flag to postprocess_variants.py to optionally only keep PASS calls in output VCF. * Addressed GitHub issues:. - Fixed the `binarize` function in modelling.py.

9," PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

This can be controlled by a flag. `-ws_use_window_selector_model` which is now on by default. . * Many micro-optimizations throughout the codebase. * Added a new [training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.7/docs/deepvariant-tpu-training-case-study.md) showing how to train and fine-tune DeepVariant models. * Added [support for CRAM files](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.7/docs/deepvariant-details.md#cram-support)","### Data for Evaluation

6,"cing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06). Our observations reinforce that DCTN4 missense variants, especially p.Tyr263Cys, may be involved in the pathogenesis of CPA in male CF. 25763772 0 5 DCTN4 T103 UMLS:C4308010. 25763772 23 63 chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 67 82 cystic fibrosis T038 UMLS:C0010674. 25763772 83 120 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 124 139 cystic fibrosis T038 UMLS:C0010674. 25763772 141 143 CF T038 UMLS:C0010674. 25763772 189 206 pulmonary disease T038 UMLS:C0024115. 25763772 233 253 chronic Pa infection T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 255 258 CPA T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 302 329 faster rate of lung decline T033 UMLS:C3160731. 25763772 350 363 exacerbations T033 UMLS:C408","### Data for Evaluation

7,"Defective survival and activation of thymocytes in transgenic mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV. We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) specifically in thymic T cells. The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.","### Data for Evaluation

In the latter case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output (providing more output space) before each call.

The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start with gz"". The gzip format is different from the zlib format. gzip is a gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream. This library can optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well. The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory and on communications channels. The gzip format was designed for single- file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

3,"A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available: Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Medical Subject Headings (MESH). To use these configured default KBs, pass the `name` parameter, either umls or mesh'. It uses a sklearn.TfidfVectorizer to embed mention text into a sparse embedding of character 3-grams. These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended!

Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data. * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.
