The provided bits will be used before any bytes are used from next_in. This function should only be used with raw inflate, and should be used before the first inflate() call after inflateInit2() or inflateReset(). bits must be less than or equal to 16, and that many of the least significant bits of value will be inserted in the input. If bits is negative, then the input stream bit buffer is emptied. Then inflatePrime() can be called again to put bits in the buffer.

14," same chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. Let me reply to this part first:. First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? --> Yes that's correct. If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes?"". If you want Chromosome 1 for your training set, and Chromosome 2 for your validation set, you'll run make_examples twice. One run to generate the training set with chr1, the other run to generate validation set as chr2. Note that in both runs, you'll run make_examples with the `--mode training` flag. This can be be a bit confusing, but `--mode training` in make_examples just means that we will create examples with truth labels. And you will need truth labels for your training set and validation set, . > . > Thank you very much for your time, and if these questions are answered clearly in a doc already, then I apologize and would appreciate being directed there. > . > Best, Haley. > .

Sometimes when we documented it, things worked, but later on some underlying dependencies might have shifted. This is actually why we packaged our variant calling in Docker to make sure the versions are more consistent. But we haven't done so for our shuffling code in the training tutorial.

18,"Induction of cytokine expression in leukocytes by binding of thrombin-stimulated platelets. BACKGROUND: Activated platelets tether and activate myeloid leukocytes. To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased. Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta, IL-8, and MCP-1 in leukocytes. Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI.","### Data for Evaluation

However, when I use the best model from training to predict variants, this class label information is not included in the VCF file. Am I misinterpreting how to use this customized class labeling?

3,"DeepVariant v1.0 releases new features and accuracy improvements sufficiently substantial to indicate a major version of v1.0. Compared to DeepVariant v0.10, these changes reduce Illumina WGS errors by 24%, exome errors by 19%, and PacBio errors by 52%. * Added ALT-aligned pileups, which creates additional input channels where reads are also aligned to the candidate ALT alleles. This is controlled by the flag `--alt_aligned_pileup`. `--alt_aligned_pileup=diff_channels` is now [default for DeepVariant PacBio model](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.0/docs/deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md). This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. . * Added new flag `--sort_by_haplotypes` to optionally allow creating pileup images with reads sorted by haplotype. Haplotype sorting is based on the HP tag that must be present in input BAM, and `--parse_sam_aux_fields` needs to be set as well. This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. * The PacBio case study now includes instructions for two-pass calling, which allows users to take advantage of the `--sort_by_haplotypes` by phasing variants and the input reads. Accuracy metrics for both single pass calling and two-pass calling are shown. Users may choose whether to run a second time for higher accuracy. * Default of `--min_mapping_quality` in make_examples.py changed from 10 to 5. This improves accuracy of all models (WGS, WES, and PACBIO). * Included a new hybrid illumina+pacbio model and documentation. * Added show_examples, a tool for showing examples as pileup image files, with documentation. * Cleaned up unused experimental flags: `--sequencing_type_image` and `--custom_pileup_image`. * Added `--only_keep_pass` flag to postprocess_variants.py to optionally only keep PASS calls in output VCF. * Addressed GitHub issues:. - Fixed the `binarize` function in modelling.py.

12,"inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back interface for input and output. This is potentially more efficient than inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer. inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large buffers. inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns. inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer. inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw deflate stream with each call. inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the allocated state. A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write ","### Data for Evaluation

Compared to DeepVariant v0.10, these changes reduce Illumina WGS errors by 24%, exome errors by 19%, and PacBio errors by 52%. * Added ALT-aligned pileups, which creates additional input channels where reads are also aligned to the candidate ALT alleles. This is controlled by the flag `--alt_aligned_pileup`. `--alt_aligned_pileup=diff_channels` is now [default for DeepVariant PacBio model](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.0/docs/deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md). This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. . * Added new flag `--sort_by_haplotypes` to optionally allow creating pileup images with reads sorted by haplotype. Haplotype sorting is based on the HP tag that must be present in input BAM, and `--parse_sam_aux_fields` needs to be set as well. This substantially improves INDEL accuracy for PacBio data. * The PacBio case study now includes instructions for two-pass calling, which allows users to take advantage of the `--sort_by_haplotypes` by phasing variants and the input reads. Accuracy metrics for both single pass calling and two-pass calling are shown. Users may choose whether to run a second time for higher accuracy. * Default of `--min_mapping_quality` in make_examples.py changed from 10 to 5. This improves accuracy of all models (WGS, WES, and PACBIO). * Included a new hybrid illumina+pacbio model and documentation. * Added show_examples, a tool for showing examples as pileup image files, with documentation. * Cleaned up unused experimental flags: `--sequencing_type_image` and `--custom_pileup_image`. * Added `--only_keep_pass` flag to postprocess_variants.py to optionally only keep PASS calls in output VCF. * Addressed GitHub issues:. - Fixed the `binarize` function in modelling.py.

In particular the GetBases(Range(chrom, start, end)) operation fetches bases from the tuple where chrom == chromosome, and then from the bases where the first base of bases starts at start. If start > 0, then the bases string is assumed to contain bases starting from that position in the region. For example, the record ('1', 10, ACGT') implies that GetBases(ranges.make_range('1', 11, 12)) will return the base C', as the A base is at position 10.

1,"el on a large corpus of citations using this objective, encouraging it to output representations that are more similar for papers that share a citation link than for those that do not. Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SCIDOCS, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark. As the pace of scientific publication continues to increase, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools that help users to search, discover and understand the scientific literature have become critical. In recent years, substantial improvements in NLP tools have been brought about by pretrained neural language models (LMs) (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019).

I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out why my calls were missing MT information...

This is a bit of an odd behavior, I think. . Solutions: Clearly document this on github (sorry if I didn't see it, if it is already there).

To understand whether events are false positives or real SNPs, I think you will want to get some orthogonal measure of whether they are accurate. It probably makes sense to look at the reads data for some of these sites in a tool like IGV to get a feel for whether they look reliable or not. One nice thing about DeepVariant is that the quality scores for variants calls are generally normally distributed and predict the human variant quality confidence quite well.

6,"cing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06). Our observations reinforce that DCTN4 missense variants, especially p.Tyr263Cys, may be involved in the pathogenesis of CPA in male CF. 25763772 0 5 DCTN4 T103 UMLS:C4308010. 25763772 23 63 chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 67 82 cystic fibrosis T038 UMLS:C0010674. 25763772 83 120 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 124 139 cystic fibrosis T038 UMLS:C0010674. 25763772 141 143 CF T038 UMLS:C0010674. 25763772 189 206 pulmonary disease T038 UMLS:C0024115. 25763772 233 253 chronic Pa infection T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 255 258 CPA T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 302 329 faster rate of lung decline T033 UMLS:C3160731. 25763772 350 363 exacerbations T033 UMLS:C408","### Data for Evaluation

If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

20," proto and associated other protos provide additional details. The AlleleCount's generated by adding each read simply sum up independently with multiple reads, which is a very attractive property of the AlleleCount representation. Note that this code can diverge from the left-alignment requirement of VCF / variant protos when the input read cigars are themselves not left aligned. For example, suppose we have: ref: TAAAC sample: TAAC Ideally an aligner would place the DELETION cigar elements for any read covering this site to the left-most position: ref: TAAAC read1: T-AAC [cigar = 1M1D3M, ideal] read2: TA-AC [cigar = 2M1D2M, pretty far from ideal, but equivalent] This code doesn't try to do anything clever by left-aligning CIGAR elements in order to fix this problem. This is largely ok because (1) the standard aligner (BWA) does in fact do consistent left alignment and (2) we anticipate feeding this AlleleCounter reads that have been assembled into a consistent alignment across all of the reads in a way that is impossible for a read-by- read aligner to do. So beware with the aligner you use, unless you've cleaned up the reads in some way (left aligning the cigars or just doing assembly). It is ok to send reads that only partially overlap the interval; the AlleleCounter will only add counts from the part that overlap the interval. This code assumes that the reference genome and the reads have only upper case bases. By construction our GenomeReference will not have lower case bases. Lower case bases are allowed in read sequences (see https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), so it may be worth upper casing the read sequence at some point to make this code more robust. AlleleCounter performs some specialized logic to deal with non-canonical bases that might occur in the reference and/or the reads. By canonical we mean bases that are one of {A,C,G,T}. The basic constraint is that we will not add Allele's that con","### Data for Evaluation

3," input data so far will be available to the decompressor, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH. This completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed codes block that is 10 bits long. This assures that enough bytes are output in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed code block. If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to seven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after the next deflate block is completed. In this case, the decompressor may not be provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of the data provided so far to the compressor. It may need to wait for the next block to be emitted. This is for advanced applications that need to control the emission of deflate blocks. If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade compression. If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error.

You can lower `--config.tune_every_steps` to perform evaluation more frequently. Checkpoints are stored whenever the `tune/f1_weighted` metric improves when. evaluating the tune dataset. In this way, the last checkpoint stored will always. be the best performing checkpoint. The best performing checkpoint metric can be. configured using `--config.best_checkpoint_metric`. We have tested training with 1 and 2 GPUs and observed the following runtimes:. n GPUs | Time. ------ | ----------. 1 | 89m39.451s. 2 | 54m8.163s. Once training is complete, the following command can be used list checkpoints:. ```bash. gsutil ls ${TRAINING_DIR}/checkpoints/. ```.

10,"ctorizer to embed mention text into a sparse embedding of character 3-grams. These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended!

We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) specifically in thymic T cells. The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity, although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development. Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation. When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore, the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter. Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus, the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells. Consequently, T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible. Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus. Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated, it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation.","### Data for Evaluation

If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`. * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:. ```. >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1. AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA. >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2. AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT. >polyA.

And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one.

If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled. * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner outpu","### Data for Evaluation

In short, all species with (very) low heterozygousity. I wonder if you see a use for Deepvariant in other species, like, there are marine species that are so ancient, diverse, widespread, you can have 5% heterozygosity, in shorts, SNPs everywhere. In such cases, Deepvariant has a tendency to ditch apparently at random (Sample1 Chrom3:20456 called, Sample2 same position not called, despite obvious evidence from mapping and support from long reads). Probably because it didn't learn what to do with so many SNPs. You know the issue because of your mosquito blog spot. And I have seen other issues (including mine) talking about that. The issue is to have a gold standard like in human, or trio data like in the mosquito, you need specific conditions, it seems difficult to imagine this could be doable with, let's say, a deep sea coral (just random example, I don't actually know what's their genome like). . Could a synthetic dataset help here? What if we feed Deepvariant a genome we made up based on what we can observed visually?

The greater computational efficiency of these dependencies results in improvements to speed. * In the training model for make_examples, we committed (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/commit/4a11046de0ad86e36d2514af9f035c9cb34414bf) that fixed an issue introduced in an earlier commit (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/commit/a4a654769f1454ea487ebf0a32d45a9f8779617b) where make_examples might generate fewer REF (class0) examples than expected. * Improvements to accuracy for Illumina WGS models for various, shorter read lengths.

This flag allows the merging of adjacent records that. all have GQ values within a bin of the given size, and for each record emits the. minimum GQ value seen within the bin. For example, setting `--gvcf_gq_binsize 5` has the effect that adjacent records. with GQ=0; GQ in [1, 5]; GQ in [6, 10]; GQ in [11, 15]; etc. are binned. together. A concrete example shown below has non-variant sites at each of positions 1-9 on. a hypothetical chromosome:. ```bash. Example input records:. Genome position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |.

The only other thing I can think of is that given that your number of reads is large, DeepVariant would downsample them before going into the model. So your supporting reads are picked by an allele counter, and it uses them to generate a matrix (image) that gets fed into the model generating the GT and GQ values. The height of these matrices is usually 100 rows. If it is greater it will randomly downsample from these reads, and usually use 95 of them as 5 are used for representing the reference sequence. I'm assuming you've updated the model as denoted in the tutorial and not used the regular WGS one. I know it's obvious, but as noted in the paper there is a difference between a RNA-seq model versus the WGS/WES one provided by DeepVariant. Other than that is there anything special around this site in IGV? Do you see this as a singular variant without anything surrounding it?

How are `AD` and `DP` values calculated? In order to efficiently perform variant calling, DeepVariant partitions the. genome into chunks (set by `--partition_size`), and will read in a max number of. reads into each partition (set by `--max_reads_per_partition`).

3,"A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available: Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Medical Subject Headings (MESH). To use these configured default KBs, pass the `name` parameter, either umls or mesh'. It uses a sklearn.TfidfVectorizer to embed mention text into a sparse embedding of character 3-grams. These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates. However, this doesn't matter if you have a classifier on top of the candidate generator, as is intended!

Two other issues (#24 and 65) had the same questions we have, and your answers to those were not detailed enough and neither is the description in the documentation. I'll try to spell out my confusion clearly... The --cut_by_quality documentation references Trimmomatic and sliding window but it does not work the same way Trimmomatic's SLIDINGWINDOW option works, which is where I think a lot of the confusion comes from. Instead, --cut_by_quality works more similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING options, except it uses a minimum window size of 2 instead of single bases like L/T. Both --cut_by_quality and L/T stop when reaching a window or base above the quality threshold. However, SLIDINGWINDOW slides down the entire sequence and can find low-quality windows in the middle of otherwise high-quality sequence and will discard the rest of the sequence starting at the low-quality window. This is why SLIDINGWINDOW should only be used after LEADING trimming, else the entire sequence that starts with a few low-quality bases would be lost. At the very least, would you please change the documentation for --cut_by_quality to specifically state that it works similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING trimming, not SLIDINGWINDOW? I would also like to request that the minimum window size be allowed to be 1 so we could use it as a single base trimmer. Finally, a further enhancement would be to include an option that does work like SLIDINGWINDOW.

2,"25763772|t|DCTN4 as a modifier of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis. 25763772|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is associated with worse long-term pulmonary disease and shorter survival, and chronic Pa infection (CPA) is associated with reduced lung function, faster rate of lung decline, increased rates of exacerbations and shorter survival. By using exome sequencing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06). Our observations reinforce that DCTN4 missense variants, especially p.Tyr263Cys, may be involved in the pathogenesis of CPA in male CF. 25763772 0 5 DCTN4 T103 UMLS:C4308010. 25763772 23 63 chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection T038 UMLS:C0854135. 25763772 67 82 cystic fibrosis T038 UMLS:C0010674. 2","### Data for Evaluation

Typically, this payload serves one of several purposes: It may provide more fine-grained semantic information about the error to facilitate actionable remedies. It may provide human-readable contexual information that is more appropriate to display to an end user. A payload consists of a [key,value] pair, where the key is a string referring to a unique type URL and the value is an object of type `absl::Cord` to hold the contextual data. The type URL should be unique and follow the format of a URL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) and, ideally, provide some documentation or schema on how to interpret its associated data. For example, the default type URL for a protobuf message type is type.googleapis.com/packagename.messagename"". Other custom wire formats should define the format of type URL in a similar practice so as to minimize the chance of conflict between type URLs. Users should ensure that the type URL can be mapped to a concrete C++ type if they want to deserialize the payload and read it effectively. To attach a payload to a status object, call `Status::SetPayload()`, passing it the type URL and an `absl::Cord` of associated data. Similarly, to extract the payload from a status, call `Status::GetPayload()`.

This results in way more reads passing the filter than there should be. As an example: . . A base with a q-score of 10 and a second base with a q-score of 20, if . averaged, would have an average q-score of 15. However, if you average the probability of errors: . A q-score of 10 is a probability of error of 0.1. A q-score of 20 is a probability of error of 0.01. Averaging the probability of error: 0.1 + 0.01 = 0.11 | 0.11 / 2 = 0.055. The q-score for a probability of error of 0.055 is ~12.5. . This number accurately reflects the average amount of error present in the read. To implement this, in the filter.cpp file, I changed the totalQual variable to a float. I then had the totalQual variable increment by the probability of error instead of the q-score. Then, in the else if statement, I divided the final totalQual value of the read by the rlen, and calculated the resulting q-score to compare to the users input. I complied the code and tested it on a simulated dataset, and the results were identical to the other nanopore quailty filtering packages I have on my machine. Thanks again for fastp!!","### Data for Evaluation

The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary). The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than with the default empty dictionary.

In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd. Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see below). Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END.

If we only had a single alt, we'd construct an image for ref vs. alt1: image1 => ref vs. alt1 => determine if we are 0/0, 0/1, 1/1 If we add a second image for alt2, we get: image2 => ref vs. alt2 => determine if we are 0/0, 0/2, 2/2 but the problem here is that we don't have a good estimate for the het-alt state 1/2. So we construct a third image contrasting ref vs. either alt1 or alt2: image3 => ref vs. alt1 or alt2 => determines 0/0, 0/{1,2}, {1,2}/{1,2} Given the predictions for each image: image1 => p00, p01, p11 image2 => p00, p02, p22 image3 => p00, p0x, pxx where x is {1,2} we calculate our six genotype likelihoods as: 0/0 => p00 [from any image] 0/1 => p01 [image1] 1/1 => p11 [image1] 0/2 => p02 [image2] 2/2 => p22 [image2] 1/2 => pxx [image3] The function create_pileup_images() returns all of the necessary images, along with the alt alleles used for each image.","### Data for Evaluation

DeepVariant is an analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call. genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. While. DeepVariant is highly accurate for. [many types of NGS data](https://rdcu.be/7Dhl), some users may be interested in. training custom deep learning models that have been optimized for very specific. data.

This is. just one example of how to train a custom model, and is neither the fastest nor. the cheapest possible configuration. The resulting model also does not represent. the greatest achievable accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data. High level summary of result. We demonstrated that by training on 1 replicate of BGISEQ-500 whole genome data.

What I would term naive trimming to Q10 would trim only the last base with quality 2, and stop because the next base has Q40. This would leave 4 internal bases with Q2, which is not desirable. The Phred algorithm would trim the last 6 bases, because their average quality (calculated by summing the error probabilities) is 2.79, which is below 10. Trimming regions with average quality below a threshold gives the optimal result in terms of the ratio of retained bases to the expected number of errors. ```.

If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively. * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it. * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters.

When a higher compression level is desired, a larger generic memory buffer needs to be supplied by setting level_buf and level_buf_size to represent the chunk of memory. For level x, the suggest size for this buffer this buffer is ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_DEFAULT.

The equivalent of the zlib FLUSH_SYNC operation is currently supported. Flush types can be NO_FLUSH, SYNC_FLUSH or FULL_FLUSH. Default flush type is NO_FLUSH. A SYNC_ OR FULL_ flush will byte align the deflate block by appending an empty stored block once all input has been compressed, including the buffered input. Checking that the out_buffer is not empty or that internal_state.state = ZSTATE_NEW_HDR is sufficient to guarantee all input has been flushed. Additionally FULL_FLUSH will ensure look back history does not include previous blocks so new blocks are fully independent. Switching between flush types is supported. If a compression dictionary is required, the dictionary can be set calling isal_deflate_set_dictionary before calling isal_deflate. If the gzip_flag is set to IGZIP_GZIP, a generic gzip header and the gzip trailer are written around the deflate compressed data.

A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer. This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1]. out() should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure. If out() returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error. Neither in() nor out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from. The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by in().

13,"Trimming for polyA/T/C; improved runtimes for downstream alignment and variant calling; Shifu;. Congrats on the paper in bioRxiv and thanks for all the great work on fastp. We've been working on improving the runtimes for somatic variant calling workflows and exploring quality and polyX trimming. We did a test run with fastp and atropos and found that the major improvements in runtime were due to removal of polyX sequences at the 3 ends of reads:. https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio_validations/tree/master/somatic_trim. We'd used the new polyG trimming functionality (thank you), but a crude method of 3 polyA/T/C adapter removal, which appears to be less effective with fastp compared to atropos trimming. When additional polyX stretches get removed we get much better runtimes for alignment and variant calling. I saw general polyX and low complexity trimming are on the roadmap for fastp and would like to express my support for this. We've been making great use of fastp for adapter conversion and would like to offer trimming as part of an effort to speed up alignment and variant calling both on NovaSeqs and more generally. As a secondary help for integration, is streaming trimming a possibility for paired ends? To help improve preparation runtimes I'd been thinking of including trimming and streaming directly into bwa/minimap2 alignment, or being able to stream outputs into bgzip so we can index and parallelize variant calling.

1,"h is complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out). In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to avail_out == 0 on return. If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd. Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see below). Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END. If not enough output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must be called again as described above. deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read so far (that is, total_in bytes). deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT). In doubt, the data is considered binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect the compression algorithm in any manner. deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero).

37,"Gets the list of model variables that should be restored. The primary use of this function is to get a subset of tf.Variables from a slim-defined model that we'd like to restore from a checkpoint. The checkpoint generally contains all of the variables in the graph during training, including things like the backprop variables, moving averages for visualization, etc. Simply restoring all of those variables is brittle, as we often want to start a new training run, maybe using a different optimizer, different visualization variables, or replacing part of the model with a new classification layer, as unneeded variables from the checkpoint get loaded into the graph and/or new TF variables not present in the graph cannot be found, raising exceptions. This function allows a clean API to get just the *model* variables from a graph, excluding all of those non-model variables, along with optionally removing parts of the model graph via exclude scopes. This function calls slim.get_model_variables() to get the raw list of all variables associated with the MODEL_VARIABLES collection. It then filters away all variables that match any of the scopes in exclude_scopes. For example, suppose we have a model with three variables with names: w1 = model/l1/weight1 w2 = model/l2/weight2 w3 = model/l2/weight3 Without any exclude scopes, we would return these three variables [w1, w2, and w3]. Providing exclude_scopes=['model/l2'] would return only [w1], while exclude_scopes=['model/l1'] would return [w2, w3]. Args: exclude_scopes: None, or a list of strings.

35," by left-aligning CIGAR elements in order to fix this problem. This is largely ok because (1) the standard aligner (BWA) does in fact do consistent left alignment and (2) we anticipate feeding this AlleleCounter reads that have been assembled into a consistent alignment across all of the reads in a way that is impossible for a read-by- read aligner to do. So beware with the aligner you use, unless you've cleaned up the reads in some way (left aligning the cigars or just doing assembly). It is ok to send reads that only partially overlap the interval; the AlleleCounter will only add counts from the part that overlap the interval. This code assumes that the reference genome and the reads have only upper case bases. By construction our GenomeReference will not have lower case bases. Lower case bases are allowed in read sequences (see https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), so it may be worth upper casing the read sequence at some point to make this code more robust. AlleleCounter performs some specialized logic to deal with non-canonical bases that might occur in the reference and/or the reads. By canonical we mean bases that are one of {A,C,G,T}. The basic constraint is that we will not add Allele's that contain non-canonical bases. So if we have a read that has (e.g.) an N, we will not produce Allele objects that contain the N. So if it doesn't match the reference at a site, it will be skipped as a SUBSTITUTION allele, and if it were part of an insertion, that entire insertion will be skipped. We do support AlleleCount objects that have a N base as its reference base, and those bases get alleles just as a normal base would. Downstream processing should look at the reference base of the AlleleCounts produced by this code for non-canonical reference bases and handle if special handling is needed. Finally, if a read's deletion CIGAR spans across part of the reference genome that has an N, the corresponding DELETION allele will ","### Data for Evaluation

",The text describes a utility function related to handling sharded files.,No significant architectural signals found. This is about a specific component's internal functionality (A1) and does not discuss cross-cutting concerns or technology stack choices.,"E2: The text mentions an algorithm but without discussing its system-wide impact, it falls under E2 exclusion for being too localized. However, note that the function is part of a larger component which might be relevant to A1 if we consider the entire system context.",False,False
2,"bad_alloc (memory?) issue postprocess_variants; Hi,. As a follow-up to my [previous question](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/166), I am trying to run the **postprocess_variants** command for DeepVariant from a Docker container on an AWS instance. I am getting the following error message:. ```. terminate called after throwing an instance of std::bad_alloc'. what(): std::bad_alloc. ```. I thought this might have been an issue with memory allocation, but I have been testing the same command with increasing computational resources (I am currently using a m5.4xlarge instance). **1)** Am I totally wrong about the underlying cause? If so, is there anything you can suggest to troubleshoot this issue? **2)** Based upon my Google searches, it seemed like this might have something to do with using TensorFlow. Is it easy to tell if that is correct? If so, does that mean you are still doing variant calling/prediction from the **postprocess_variants** command? This is the command that I am running:. ```. OUTPUT_DIR=/mnt/efs-genome/Charles_Human/Genos_Exome/Genos_Alignment/DeepVariant. REF=/mnt/efs-genome/Ref/hg19.gatk.fasta. CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT=""${OUTPUT_DIR}/call_variants_output.tfrecord.gz"". FINAL_OUTPUT_VCF=""${OUTPUT_DIR}/output.vcf.gz"". sudo docker run \. -v /mnt/efs-genome:/mnt/efs-genome \. gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant \. /opt/deepvariant/bin/postprocess_variants \. --ref ${REF} \. --infile ${CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT} \. --outfile ${FINAL_OUTPUT_VCF}"". ```. Thank you very much for your assistance! Sincerely,. Charles.","### Data for Evaluation

Now, apply the analysis steps defined in your system prompt to the data provided above.
",The text appears to be a description of an error or exception encountered during processing variants related to memory allocation.,"No significant architectural signals found. The mention of 'bad_alloc' is likely referring to a specific runtime error in C++ regarding memory allocation failure, which does not inherently represent a system-wide design choice unless explicitly discussed as such.","E1: Localized Implementation Bugs - The text mentions an exception ('bad_alloc') that could be interpreted as a bug or error condition. However, the prompt's exclusion rule E1 states to exclude specific errors confined to internal logic of a single function if they do not reflect broader design concerns.",False,False
10,"From a couple of stack overflow posts and other github issues, it looks like PyPi does not support a package having non-PyPi dependencies. My suggestion would be to just put the installation of `en_ner_craft_md` in an installation instructions section of your readme. Another option would be to try to import it wherever you need it in your package code, and if its not installed, throw an exception that tells the user how to install it.","### Data for Evaluation

",The text appears to be an incomplete or corrupted snippet from some source (possibly Stack Overflow) that references other sources but does not provide any substantive content for architectural evaluation.,"No significant architectural signals found. The input is too vague and lacks concrete details about system structure, component interactions, cross-cutting concerns, technology stack, or data modeling.","E1: Localized Implementation Bugs - The text does not describe any specific bug or error condition that would be considered a localized implementation issue.

E2: Abstract Algorithmic Descriptions - There is no description of an algorithm at all in the provided snippet.

E3: Trivial Setup and Configuration - This input does not contain any setup commands, configuration snippets, or installation instructions. It also does not discuss systemic challenges related to technology stack or portability.

E4: Project Management & Development Process Artifacts - The text does not mention anything about project management, development processes, code style, documentation formatting, version numbers, or repository structure.

E5: Non-Software Engineering Domains - There is no indication that architectural terms are being applied to non-software systems.","The provided text snippet lacks sufficient detail and context to be considered architecturally significant. It does not discuss any of the core tenets (A1-A5) nor does it fall under exclusionary criteria, but due to its vagueness and lack of substantive content, no architectural signal is present.",False
