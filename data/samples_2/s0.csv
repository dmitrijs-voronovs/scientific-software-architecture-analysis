You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time.

But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6).

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

",False,"This appears to be a list of features or tasks being addressed in the context of genetic data processing (likely referring to bioinformatics tools). While it is structured as bullet points, each item describes an action ('Revise overlap detection', 'PE correction', etc.) that requires explanation. The phrase 'Support average quality score filter' and 'Count polyX' suggest technical implementation details which may be part of a design discussion or code documentation explaining the rationale behind these changes. However, without explicit context about why these features are being implemented (e.g., to improve accuracy, efficiency, etc.), it is ambiguous whether this constitutes an explanation.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

For example, `. @NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15`. means that 150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2. `fastp` prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2. Same as the [base correction feature](#base-correction-for-pe-data), this function is also based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. duplication rate and deduplication. For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. duplication rate evaluation. By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_","

ag like `merged_xxx_yyy`will be added to each read name to indicate that how many base pairs are from read1 and from read2, respectively. For example, `. @NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15`. means that 150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2. `fastp` prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2. Same as the [base correction feature](#base-correction-for-pe-data), this function is also based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. duplication rate and deduplication. For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. duplication rate evaluation. By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_

- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").

- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

In severe cases, a myriad of coagulopathy associated symptoms often correlating with COVID-19 severity is seen (e.g., BLOOD COAGULATION; THROMBOSIS; ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME; SEIZURES; HEART ATTACK; STROKE; multiple CEREBRAL INFARCTIONS; KIDNEY FAILURE; catastrophic ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODY SYNDROME and/or DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION). In younger patients, rare inflammatory syndromes are sometimes associated with COVID-19 (e.g., atypical KAWASAKI SYNDROME; TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME; pediatric multisystem inflammatory disease; and CYTOKINE STORM SYNDROME). A coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in the genus BETACORONAVIRUS is the causative agent. TUI(s): T047. Aliases (abbreviated, total: 47):. 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection, SARS-CoV-2 Disease, Human Coronavirus 2019 Infection, SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (disorder), Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, 2019 nCoV Disease, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease, COVID-19 Virus Disease, Virus Disease, COVID-19. ```. It also includes a small bug fix to the abbreviation detector. Note: The models (e.g. `en_core_sci_sm`) are still labeled as version `v0.5.1`, as this release did not involve retraining the base models, only the entity linkers.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

7," in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids. This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical entity. This point is important for two reasons: 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, Jefferson County may be an alias for both the canonical ids Jefferson County, Iowa and Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates.

Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
Aggregate assignment turns into llvm.memcpy. This is almost valid per C99 6.5.16.1p3, which states If the value being stored in an object is read from another object that overlaps in anyway the storage of the first object, then the overlap shall be exact and the two objects shall have qualified or unqualified versions of a compatible type. memcpy is not defined if the source and destination pointers are exactly equal, but other compilers do this optimization, and almost every memcpy implementation handles this case safely. If there is a libc that does not safely handle this, we can add a target hook. Get data size info for this aggregate. Don't copy the tail padding if this might be a potentially-overlapping subobject, since the tail padding might be occupied by a different object. Otherwise, copying it is fine.
",False,"This text explains the rationale behind using llvm.memcpy for aggregate assignment and discusses C99 standard requirements regarding overlapping storage. It covers potential issues with compiler optimizations and proposes handling strategies (checking data size, avoiding tail padding copy in certain cases). The explanation includes references to other compilers' behavior and suggests a solution involving target hooks or conditional copying. This falls under Principle #1 as it provides substantial reasoning about the 'why' and 'how' of ensuring safe aggregate assignment by analyzing compiler behaviors and standard compliance."

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

It provides context about what is included in this release, which falls under 'what' but also implies reasons for inclusion. However, it does contain some explanatory elements: the mention of scibert base uncased suggests a choice in model implementation, and noting that NER will come later indicates future plans or limitations. Since there's discussion around features and their implications (even if brief), this aligns with Principle #1 to keep high-value explanations."
15,"This is similar to issue 191 but I think there is an additional thing going on. The given adapter *is* trimmed from the reads, but since fastp assumes everything is a 3 adapter, it has no way of knowing you may want to keep things 3 of the adapter sequence (and remove things 5 of that sequence). All the reads contain the adapter within 15 bases, so when fastp trims the adapter (and downstream sequence), the remaining 15mers are thrown out. . I would argue that 5 adapter trimming is probably the only feature fastp is missing to make it the ultimate trimming tool. The additional thing here is that the two reads that remain contain a bit of the Illumina adapter at the 3 end, which fastp trims. It appears that fastp considers trimming complete when it finds that one sequence. **Is this the expected behavior?** I think it would make more sense to find the adapter that trims the largest portion of the read, or at least make greedy adapter trimming an option. Cutadapt enables this by an option to do repeated adapter trimming on each read (option `-n` I think).","

- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Analysis Task:

Now, analyze the following text snippet and provide your JSON output.

**Content to analyze:**
This is similar to issue 191 but I think there is an additional thing going on. The given adapter *is* trimmed from the reads, but since fastp assumes everything is a 3 adapter, it has no way of knowing you may want to keep things 3 of the adapter sequence (and remove things 5 of that sequence). All the reads contain the adapter within 15 bases, so when fastp trims the adapter (and downstream sequence), the remaining 15mers are thrown out. . I would argue that 5 adapter trimming is probably the only feature fastp is missing to make it the ultimate trimming tool. The additional thing here is that the two reads that remain contain a bit of the Illumina adapter at the 3 end, which fastp trims. It appears that fastp considers trimming complete when it finds that one sequence. **Is this the expected behavior?** I think it would make more sense to find the adapter that trims the largest portion of the read, or at least make greedy adapter trimming an option. Cutadapt enables this by an option to do repeated adapter trimming on each read (option `-n` I think).
",False,"This text contains a detailed explanation about the behavior of fastp and how it compares to other tools like Cutadapt, discussing specific issues such as incomplete adapter removal and suggesting improvements. It explains 'why' certain features might be missing in fastp and provides context for potential changes, which aligns with Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations."

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

Neither in() nor out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from. The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by in(). For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in. If that input is exhausted, then in() will be called. Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before calling inflateBack(). If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called immediately for input. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1]. The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called. These descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller- supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job. On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call. The return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized. In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning non-zero. (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.) Note that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.","

The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero amount of input may be provided by in(). For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in. If that input is exhausted, then in() will be called. Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before calling inflateBack(). If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called immediately for input. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1]. The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called. These descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller- supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job. On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call. The return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized. In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error. If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning non-zero. (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.) Note that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

We're expecting to see the PCA plots like this (one scRNA-seq dataset, one dot). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75048821/196796252-12c072d1-992e-4056-af09-10168f225a9a.png). but it generates PCA plots like this (every cell has a dot). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75048821/196802697-e751d475-2ac6-4cea-9af5-02340ef6d023.png). **We're wondering whether it is possible to plot a PCA plot for multiple datasets with one single dot representing one scRNA-seq dataset.**. Thanks! Best,. Yuanjian.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

It includes multiple g++ commands with flags and source file paths, followed by undefined reference errors for functions like gzbuffer and gzoffset, which are likely related to zlib compression library usage in C++. The final line is a question asking for suggestions on how to fix these errors. This content contains both technical details about the build process (what was compiled) and an error analysis that explains why the compilation failed due to missing references to specific functions from the zlib library. Since it includes explanations of 'why' the build might be failing, specifically pointing out undefined references which implies a potential issue with linking or missing libraries, this qualifies as high-value explanatory text under Principle #1. It is not merely low-level noise but provides insight into debugging and resolving compilation errors."

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

I'll try to spell out my confusion clearly... The --cut_by_quality documentation references Trimmomatic and sliding window but it does not work the same way Trimmomatic's SLIDINGWINDOW option works, which is where I think a lot of the confusion comes from. Instead, --cut_by_quality works more similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING options, except it uses a minimum window size of 2 instead of single bases like L/T. Both --cut_by_quality and L/T stop when reaching a window or base above the quality threshold. However, SLIDINGWINDOW slides down the entire sequence and can find low-quality windows in the middle of otherwise high-quality sequence and will discard the rest of the sequence starting at the low-quality window. This is why SLIDINGWINDOW should only be used after LEADING trimming, else the entire sequence that starts with a few low-quality bases would be lost. At the very least, would you please change the documentation for --cut_by_quality to specifically state that it works similar to Trimmomatic's LEADING and TRAILING trimming, not SLIDINGWINDOW? I would also like to request that the minimum window size be allowed to be 1 so we could use it as a single base trimmer. Finally, a further enhancement would be to include an option that does work like SLIDINGWINDOW.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

You are a data filtering bot. Your task is to analyze the user-provided text snippet and decide whether to keep it or eliminate it. You must return a JSON object with a boolean `to_eliminate` field and a `reasoning` string.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.

## Core Principle: Substance Over Form
Your judgment MUST be based on the **intent and substance** of the text, not its structure. A detailed explanation is valuable whether it is in a comment, a commit message, or formal documentation.

## Hierarchy of Rules (Apply in this order):

### **Principle #1: KEEP High-Value Explanations (This is your most important rule)**
You **MUST KEEP** any text that explains the **'why'** or **'how'** of a system, design, or piece of code.
- **This includes:** Detailed documentation (like the LLVM `LoopPass` description), discussions of trade-offs (e.g., ""This is faster but uses more memory""), explanations of design principles (e.g., the ""soft vs. hard errors"" discussion), and bug reports that analyze a problem.
- **CRITICAL:** If text contains substantial explanatory prose, it **MUST BE KEPT**, even if it also contains code snippets, tables, or formal language.

### **Principle #2: KEEP Simple Human Communication**
You **MUST KEEP** text that is clearly a human communicating to another human.
- **This includes:** Bug reports, commit messages with context, and questions or answers in a discussion thread.

### **Principle #3: ELIMINATE Unambiguous Noise and Low-Value Artifacts (Apply only if Principles 1 & 2 do not apply)**
You should only eliminate text if it provides **no explanatory value.** This is for content that only describes **'what'** without any of the 'why' or 'how' context.
- **This includes:**
  - `Log File / Trace / Output`: Raw output from a program (e.g., compiler errors, stack traces, build logs).
  - `Low-Level Code Comment`: A terse comment that only describes a single line of code without rationale (e.g., ""Compute the static offset"", ""Returns the ID"").
  - `Raw Data List / Changelog`: A bare list of items (e.g., file paths, function names, simple version changes) without surrounding explanatory prose.
  - `Boilerplate Notice`: Standard copyright or license text.
