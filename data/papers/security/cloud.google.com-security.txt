Implement preemptive cyber defense
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to build robust cyber-defense programs as part of your
overall security strategy.
This principle emphasizes the use of threat intelligence to proactively guide
your efforts across the core cyber-defense functions, as defined in
The Defender's Advantage: A guide to activating cyber defense
.
Principle overview
When you defend your system against cyber attacks, you have a significant,
underutilized advantage against attackers. As
the founder of Mandiant states
,
"You should know more about your business, your systems, your topology, your
infrastructure than any attacker does. This is an incredible advantage." To
help you use this inherent advantage, this document provides recommendations
about proactive and strategic cyber-defense practices that are mapped to the
Defender's Advantage framework.
Recommendations
To implement preemptive cyber defense for your cloud workloads, consider the
recommendations in the following sections:
Integrate the functions of cyber defense
Use the Intelligence function in all aspects of cyber defense
Understand and capitalize on your defender's advantage
Validate and improve your defenses continuously
Manage and coordinate cyber-defense efforts
Integrate the functions of cyber defense
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
The Defender's Advantage framework identifies six critical functions of
cyber defense:
Intelligence
,
Detect
,
Respond
,
Validate
,
Hunt
, and
Mission Control.
Each function focuses on a unique part of the
cyber-defense mission, but these functions must be well-coordinated and
work together to provide an effective defense. Focus on building a robust
and integrated system where each function supports the others. If you need
a phased approach for adoption, consider the following suggested order.
Depending on your current cloud maturity, resource topology, and specific
threat landscape, you might want to prioritize certain functions.
Intelligence
: The Intelligence function guides all the other
functions. Understanding the threat landscape—including the most likely
attackers, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the
potential impact—is critical to prioritizing actions across the entire
program. The Intelligence function is responsible for stakeholder
identification, definition of intelligence requirements, data collection,
analysis and dissemination, automation, and the creation of a cyber
threat profile.
Detect and Respond
: These functions make up the core of active
defense, which involves identifying and addressing malicious activity.
These functions are necessary to act on the intelligence that's gathered by
the intelligence function. The Detect function requires a methodical
approach that aligns detections to attacker TTPs and ensures robust
logging. The Respond function must focus on initial triage, data
collection, and incident remediation.
Validate
: The Validate function is a continuous process that
provides assurance that your security control ecosystem is up-to-date and
operating as designed. This function ensures that your organization
understands the attack surface, knows where vulnerabilities exist, and
measures the effectiveness of controls. Security validation is also an
important component of the detection engineering lifecycle and must be used
to identify detection gaps and create new detections.
Hunt
: The Hunt function involves proactively searching for active
threats within an environment. This function must be implemented when your
organization has a baseline level of maturity in the Detect and Respond
functions. The Hunt function expands the detection capabilities and helps
to identify gaps and weaknesses in controls. The Hunt function must be
based on specific threats. This advanced function benefits from a
foundation of robust intelligence, detection, and response capabilities.
Mission Control
: The Mission Control function acts as the central
hub that connects all of the other functions. This function is
responsible for strategy, communication, and decisive action across your
cyber-defense program. It ensures that all of the functions are working
together and that they're aligned with your organization's business goals.
You must focus on establishing a clear understanding of the purpose of the
Mission Control function before you use it to connect the other functions.
Use the Intelligence function in all aspects of cyber defense
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
This recommendation highlights the Intelligence function as a core part of a strong
cyber-defense program. Threat intelligence provides knowledge about threat
actors, their TTPs, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). This knowledge should
inform and prioritize actions across all cyber-defense functions. An
intelligence-driven approach helps you align defenses to meet the threats that
are most likely to affect your organization. This approach also helps with
efficient allocation and prioritization of resources.
The following Google Cloud products and features help you take advantage
of threat intelligence to guide your security operations. Use these features to
identify and prioritize potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks, and then
plan and implement appropriate actions.
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps)
helps you store and analyze security data centrally. Use
Google SecOps to map logs into a common model, enrich the
logs, and link the logs to timelines for a comprehensive view of attacks.
You can also create detection rules, set up IoC matching, and perform
threat-hunting activities. The platform also provides curated detections,
which are predefined and managed rules to help identify threats.
Google SecOps can also integrate with
Mandiant frontline intelligence
.
Google SecOps uniquely integrates industry-leading AI, along
with
threat intelligence from Mandiant
and
Google VirusTotal
.
This integration is critical for threat evaluation and understanding who is
targeting your organization and the potential impact.
Security Command Center
Enterprise, which is powered by Google AI, enables security professionals to
efficiently assess, investigate, and respond to security issues across
multiple cloud environments. The security professionals who can benefit
from Security Command Center include security operations center (SOC) analysts,
vulnerability and posture analysts, and compliance managers. Security Command Center
Enterprise enriches security data, assesses risk, and prioritizes
vulnerabilities. This solution provides teams with the information that they
need to address high-risk vulnerabilities and to remediate active threats.
Chrome Enterprise Premium
offers threat and data protection, which helps to protect users from
exfiltration risks and prevents malware from getting onto
enterprise-managed devices. Chrome Enterprise Premium also provides visibility into
unsafe or potentially unsafe activity that can happen within the browser.
Network monitoring, through tools like
Network Intelligence Center
,
provides visibility into network performance. Network monitoring can also
help you detect unusual traffic patterns or detect data transfer amounts
that might indicate an attack or data exfiltration attempt.
Understand and capitalize on your defender's advantage
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
As mentioned earlier, you have an advantage over attackers when you have
a thorough understanding of your business, systems, topology, and
infrastructure. To capitalize on this knowledge advantage, utilize this data
about your environments during cyberdefense planning.
Google Cloud provides the following features to help you proactively gain
visibility to identify threats, understand risks, and respond in a timely manner
to mitigate potential damage:
Chrome Enterprise Premium helps you enhance security for enterprise devices by
protecting users from exfiltration risks. It extends
Sensitive Data Protection services
into the browser, and prevents malware. It also offers features like
protection against malware and phishing to help prevent exposure to unsafe
content. In addition, it gives you control over the installation of
extensions to help prevent unsafe or unvetted extensions. These
capabilities help you establish a secure foundation for your operations.
Security Command Center Enterprise provides a continuous
risk engine
that offers comprehensive and ongoing risk analysis and management. The risk
engine feature enriches security data, assesses risk, and prioritizes
vulnerabilities to help fix issues quickly. Security Command Center enables your
organization to proactively identify weaknesses and implement mitigations.
Google SecOps centralizes security data and provides
enriched logs with timelines. This enables defenders to proactively
identify active compromises and adapt defenses based on attackers' behavior.
Network monitoring helps identify irregular network activity that might
indicate an attack and it provides early indicators that you can use to take
action. To help proactively protect your data from theft, continuously monitor
for data exfiltration and use the provided tools.
Validate and improve your defenses continuously
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
This recommendation emphasizes the importance of targeted testing and
continuous validation of controls to understand strengths and weaknesses
across the entire attack surface. This includes validating the
effectiveness of controls, operations, and staff through methods like the
following:
Penetration tests
Red-blue team
and
purple team
exercises
Tabletop exercises
You must also actively search for threats and use the results to improve
detection and visibility. Use the following tools to continuously test and
validate your defenses against real-world threats:
Security Command Center Enterprise provides a continuous risk engine to evaluate
vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation, which enables ongoing
evaluation of your overall security posture. By prioritizing issues,
Security Command Center Enterprise helps you to ensure that resources are used effectively.
Google SecOps offers threat-hunting and curated
detections that let you proactively identify weaknesses in your controls.
This capability enables continuous testing and improvement of your ability
to detect threats.
Chrome Enterprise Premium provides threat and data protection features that
can help you to address new and evolving threats, and continuously update
your defenses against exfiltration risks and malware.
Cloud Next Generation Firewall (Cloud NGFW) provides network monitoring
and data-exfiltration monitoring. These capabilities can help you to validate
the effectiveness of your current security posture and identify potential
weaknesses. Data-exfiltration monitoring helps you to validate the strength
of your organization's data protection mechanisms and make proactive
adjustments where necessary. When you integrate threat findings from
Cloud NGFW with Security Command Center and Google SecOps,
you can optimize network-based threat detection, optimize threat response,
and automate playbooks. For more information about this integration, see
Unifying Your Cloud Defenses: Security Command Center & Cloud NGFW Enterprise
.
Manage and coordinate cyber-defense efforts
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
As described earlier in
Integrate the functions of cyber defense
,
the Mission Control function interconnects the other functions of the
cyber-defense program. This function enables coordination and unified
management across the program. It also helps you coordinate with other teams
that don't work on cybersecurity. The Mission Control function promotes
empowerment and accountability, facilitates agility and expertise, and drives
responsibility and transparency.
The following products and features can help you implement the Mission Control
function:
Security Command Center Enterprise acts as a central hub for coordinating and
managing your cyber-defense operations. It brings tools, teams, and data
together, along with the built-in Google SecOps response
capabilities. Security Command Center provides clear visibility into your
organization's security state and enables the identification of security
misconfigurations across different resources.
Google SecOps provides a platform for teams to respond to
threats by mapping logs and creating timelines. You can also define
detection rules and search for threats.
Google Workspace
and Chrome Enterprise Premium help you to manage and control end-user access to
sensitive resources. You can define granular access controls based on user
identity and the context of a request.
Network monitoring provides insights into the performance of network
resources. You can import network monitoring insights into Security Command Center
and Google SecOps for centralized monitoring and correlation
against other timeline based data points. This integration helps you to
detect and respond to potential network usage changes caused by nefarious
activity.
Data-exfiltration monitoring helps to identify possible data loss
incidents. With this feature, you can efficiently mobilize an incident
response team, assess damages, and limit further data exfiltration. You can
also improve current policies and controls to ensure data protection.

Implement security by design
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to incorporate robust security features, controls, and
practices into the design of your cloud applications, services, and platforms.
From ideation to operations, security is more effective when it's embedded as an
integral part of every stage of your design process.
Principle overview
As explained in
An Overview of Google's Commitment to Secure by Design
,
secure by default
and
secure by design
are often used interchangeably, but
they represent distinct approaches to building secure systems. Both approaches
aim to minimize vulnerabilities and enhance security, but they differ in scope
and implementation:
Secure by default
: focuses on ensuring that a system's default
settings are set to a secure mode, minimizing the need for users or
administrators to take actions to secure the system. This approach aims to
provide a baseline level of security for all users.
Secure by design
: emphasizes proactively incorporating security
considerations throughout a system's development lifecycle. This approach
is about anticipating potential threats and vulnerabilities early and
making design choices that mitigate risks. This approach involves using
secure coding practices, conducting security reviews, and embedding
security throughout the design process. The secure-by-design approach is an
overarching philosophy that guides the development process and helps to ensure
that security isn't an afterthought but is an integral part of a system's design.
Recommendations
To implement the secure by design principle for your cloud workloads, consider
the recommendations in the following sections:
Choose system components that help to secure your workloads
Build a layered security approach
Use hardened and attested infrastructure and services
Encrypt data at rest and in transit
Choose system components that help to secure your workloads
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
A fundamental decision for effective security is the selection of robust system
components—including both hardware and software components—that constitute
your platform, solution, or service. To reduce the security attack surface and
limit potential damage, you must also carefully consider the deployment patterns
of these components and their configurations.
In your application code, we recommend that you use straightforward, safe, and
reliable libraries, abstractions, and application frameworks in order to eliminate
classes of vulnerabilities. To scan for vulnerabilities in software libraries,
you can use third-party tools. You can also use
Assured Open Source Software
,
which helps to reduce risks to your software supply chain by using open source
software (OSS) packages that Google uses and secures.
Your infrastructure must use networking, storage, and compute options that
support safe operation and align with your security requirements and risk
acceptance levels. Infrastructure security is important for both internet-facing
and internal workloads.
For information about other Google solutions that support this recommendation,
see
Implement shift-left security
.
Build a layered security approach
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
AI and ML security
Infrastructure security
Identity and access management
Data security
We recommend that you implement security at each layer of your application and
infrastructure stack by applying a defense-in-depth approach.
Use the security features in each component of your platform. To limit access
and identify the boundaries of the potential impact (that is, the
blast radius
)
in the event of a security incident, do the following:
Simplify your system's design to accommodate flexibility where possible.
Document the security requirements of each component.
Incorporate a robust secured mechanism to address resiliency and recovery
requirements.
When you design the security layers, perform a risk assessment to determine the
security features that you need in order to meet internal security requirements
and external regulatory requirements. We recommend that you use an
industry-standard risk assessment framework that applies to cloud environments
and that is relevant to your regulatory requirements. For example, the Cloud
Security Alliance (CSA) provides the
Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
.
Your risk assessment provides you with a catalog of risks and corresponding
security controls to mitigate them.
When you perform the risk assessment, remember that you have a shared
responsibility arrangement with your cloud provider. Therefore, your risks in a
cloud environment differ from your risks in an on-premises environment. For
example, in an on-premises environment, you need to mitigate vulnerabilities to
your hardware stack. In contrast, in a cloud environment, the cloud provider
bears these risks. Also, remember that the boundaries of shared responsibilities
differ between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services for each cloud provider.
After you identify potential risks, you must design and create a mitigation
plan that uses technical, administrative, and operational controls, as well as
contractual protections and third-party attestations. In addition, a threat
modeling method, such as the
OWASP application threat modeling method
,
helps you to identify potential gaps and suggest actions to address the gaps.
Use hardened and attested infrastructure and services
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
A mature security program mitigates new vulnerabilities as described in
security bulletins. The security program should also provide remediation to fix
vulnerabilities in existing deployments and secure your VM and container
images. You can use hardening guides that are specific to the OS and application
of your images, as well as benchmarks like the one provided by the
Center of Internet Security (CIS)
.
If you use custom images for your Compute Engine VMs, you need to patch the
images yourself. Alternatively, you can use Google-provided
curated OS images
,
which are patched regularly. To run containers on Compute Engine VMs, use
Google-curated
Container-optimized OS images
.
Google regularly patches and updates these images.
If you use GKE, we recommend that you enable
node auto-upgrades
so that Google updates your cluster nodes with the latest patches. Google
manages GKE control planes, which are automatically updated
and patched. To further reduce the attack surface of your containers, you can
use
distroless images
.
Distroless images are ideal for security-sensitive applications, microservices,
and situations where minimizing the image size and attack surface is
paramount.
For sensitive workloads, use
Shielded VM
,
which prevents malicious code from being loaded during the VM boot cycle.
Shielded VM instances provide boot security, monitor integrity, and use
the
Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM)
.
To help secure SSH access,
OS Login
lets your employees connect to your VMs by using
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
as the source of truth instead of relying on SSH keys. Therefore, you don't need
to manage SSH keys throughout your organization. OS Login ties an
administrator's access to their employee lifecycle, so when employees change
roles or leave your organization, their access is revoked with their account. OS
Login also supports
Google two-factor authentication
,
which adds an extra layer of security against account takeover attacks.
In GKE, application instances run within Docker
containers. To enable a defined risk profile and to restrict employees from
making changes to containers, ensure that your containers are stateless and
immutable. The immutability principle means that your employees don't modify the
container or access it interactively. If the container must be changed, you
build a new image and redeploy that image. Enable SSH access to the underlying
containers only in specific debugging scenarios.
To help globally secure configurations across your environment, you can use
organization policies
to set constraints or guardrails on resources that affect the behavior of your
cloud assets. For example, you can define the following organization policies
and apply them either globally across a Google Cloud organization or
selectively at the level of a folder or project:
Disable external IP address allocation to VMs.
Restrict resource creation to specific geographical locations.
Disable the creation of Service Accounts or their keys.
Encrypt data at rest and in transit
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Infrastructure security
Data security
Data encryption is a foundational control to protect sensitive information, and
it's a key part of
data governance
.
An effective data protection strategy includes access control, data segmentation
and geographical residency, auditing,
and
encryption implementation that's
based on a careful assessment of requirements.
By default, Google Cloud
encrypts customer data that's stored at rest
,
with no action required from you. In addition to default encryption,
Google Cloud provides options for envelope encryption and encryption key
management. You must identify the solutions that best fit your requirements for
key generation, storage, and rotation, whether you're choosing the keys for your
storage, for compute, or for big data workloads. For example,
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEKs)
can be created in
Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS)
.
The CMEKs can be either software-based or
HSM-protected
to meet your regulatory or compliance requirements, such as the need to rotate
encryption keys regularly. Cloud KMS Autokey lets you automate the
provisioning and assignment of CMEKs. In addition, you can bring your own keys
that are sourced from a third-party key management system by using
Cloud External Key Manager (Cloud EKM)
.
We strongly recommend that data be encrypted in-transit.
Google encrypts and authenticates data in transit
at one or more network layers when data moves outside physical boundaries that
aren't controlled by Google or on behalf of Google. All VM-to-VM traffic within
a VPC network and between peered VPC networks is encrypted. You can use
MACsec
for encryption of traffic over Cloud Interconnect connections. IPsec provides
encryption for traffic over
Cloud VPN
connections. You can protect application-to-application traffic in the cloud by
using security features like
TLS and mTLS configurations in Apigee
and
Cloud Service Mesh
for containerized applications.
By default, Google Cloud encrypts data at rest and data in transit across
the network. However, data isn't encrypted by default while it's in use in
memory. If your organization handles confidential data, you need to mitigate any
threats that undermine the confidentiality and integrity of either the
application or the data in system memory. To mitigate these threats, you can use
Confidential Computing, which provides a trusted execution environment for your
compute workloads. For more information, see
Confidential VM overview

Implement shift-left security
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you identify practical controls that you can implement early in the
software development lifecycle to improve your security posture. It provides
recommendations that help you implement preventive security guardrails and
post-deployment security controls.
Principle overview
Shift-left security
means adopting security practices early in the software
development lifecycle. This principle has the following goals:
Avoid security defects before system changes are made. Implement
preventive security guardrails and adopt practices such as infrastructure
as code (IaC), policy as code, and security checks in the CI/CD pipeline.
You can also use other platform-specific capabilities like
Organization Policy Service
and
hardened GKE clusters
in Google Cloud.
Detect and fix security bugs early, fast, and reliably after any system
changes are committed. Adopt practices like code reviews, post-deployment
vulnerability scanning, and security testing.
The
Implement security by design
and shift-left security principles are related but they differ in scope.
The security-by-design principle helps you to avoid fundamental design flaws that would
require re-architecting the entire system. For example, a threat-modeling
exercise reveals that the current design doesn't include an authorization
policy, and all users would have the same level of access without it. Shift-left
security helps you to avoid implementation defects (bugs and misconfigurations)
before changes are applied, and it enables fast, reliable fixes after deployment.
Recommendations
To implement the shift-left security principle for your cloud workloads,
consider the recommendations in the following sections:
Adopt preventive security controls
Automate provisioning and management of cloud resources
Automate secure application releases
Ensure that application deployments follow approved processes
Scan for known vulnerabilities before application deployment
Monitor your application code for known vulnerabilities
Adopt preventive security controls
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Identity and access management
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
Preventive security controls are crucial for maintaining a strong security
posture in the cloud. These controls help you proactively mitigate risks. You
can prevent misconfigurations and unauthorized access to resources, enable
developers to work efficiently, and help ensure compliance with industry
standards and internal policies.
Preventive security controls are more effective when they're implemented by
using infrastructure as code (IaC). With IaC, preventive security controls can
include more customized checks on the infrastructure code before changes are
deployed. When combined with automation, preventive security controls can run as
part of your CI/CD pipeline's automatic checks.
The following products and Google Cloud capabilities can help you implement
preventive controls in your environment:
Organization Policy Service constraints
:
configure predefined and custom constraints with centralized control.
VPC Service Controls
:
create perimeters around your Google Cloud services.
Identity and Access Management (IAM),
Privileged Access Manager
,
and
principal access boundary policies
:
restrict access to resources.
Policy Controller
and
Open Policy Agent (OPA)
:
enforce IaC constraints in your CI/CD pipeline and avoid cloud
misconfigurations.
IAM lets you authorize
who
can act on specific resources based
on permissions. For more information, see
Access control for organization resources with IAM
.
Organization Policy Service lets you set restrictions on resources to specify how they can
be configured. For example, you can use an organization policy to do the
following:
Limit resource sharing
based on domain.
Limit the use of service accounts
.
Restrict the physical location
of newly created resources.
In addition to using organizational policies, you can restrict access to
resources by using the following methods:
Tags with IAM
:
assign a tag to a set of resources and then set the access definition for
the tag itself, rather than defining the access permissions on each resource.
IAM Conditions
:
define conditional, attribute-based access control for resources.
Defense in depth: use VPC Service Controls to further restrict
access to resources.
For more information about resource management, see
Decide a resource hierarchy for your Google Cloud landing zone
.
Automate provisioning and management of cloud resources
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Application security
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
Automating the provisioning and management of cloud resources and workloads is
more effective when you also adopt declarative IaC, as opposed to imperative
scripting. IaC isn't a security tool or practice on its own, but it helps you
to improve the security of your platform. Adopting IaC lets you create
repeatable infrastructure and provides your operations team with a known good
state. IaC also improves the efficiency of rollbacks, audit changes, and
troubleshooting.
When combined with CI/CD pipelines and automation, IaC also gives you the
ability to adopt practices such as
policy as code
with tools like OPA. You can
audit infrastructure changes over time and run automatic checks on the
infrastructure code before changes are deployed.
To automate the infrastructure deployment, you can use tools like
Config Controller
,
Terraform, Jenkins, and
Cloud Build
.
To help you build a secure application environment using IaC and automation,
Google Cloud provides the
enterprise foundations blueprint
.
This blueprint is Google's opinionated design that follows all of our
recommended practices and configurations. The blueprint provides step-by-step
instructions to configure and deploy your Google Cloud topology by using
Terraform and Cloud Build.
You can modify the scripts of the
enterprise foundations blueprint to configure an environment that follows Google
recommendations and meets your own security requirements. You can further build
on the blueprint with additional blueprints or design your own automation. The
Google Cloud Architecture Center provides other blueprints that can be
implemented on top of the enterprise foundations blueprint. The following are a
few examples of these blueprints:
Deploy an enterprise developer platform on Google Cloud
Deploy a secured serverless architecture using Cloud Run
Build and deploy generative AI and machine learning models in an enterprise
Import data from Google Cloud into a secured BigQuery data warehouse
Automate secure application releases
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.
Without automated tools, it can be difficult to deploy, update, and patch
complex application environments to meet consistent security requirements. We
recommend that you build automated CI/CD pipelines for your software development
lifecycle (SDLC). Automated CI/CD pipelines help you to remove manual errors,
provide standardized development feedback loops, and enable efficient product
iterations. Continuous delivery is one of the best practices that the
DORA framework
recommends.
Automating application releases by using CI/CD pipelines helps to improve your
ability to detect and fix security bugs early, fast, and reliably. For example,
you can scan for security vulnerabilities automatically when artifacts are
created, narrow the scope of security reviews, and roll back to a known and safe
version. You can also define policies for different environments (such as
development, test, or production environments) so that only verified artifacts
are deployed.
To help you automate application releases and embed security checks in your
CI/CD pipeline, Google Cloud provides multiple tools including
Cloud Build
,
Cloud Deploy
,
Web Security Scanner
,
and
Binary Authorization
.
To establish a process that verifies multiple security requirements in your SDLC,
use the
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)
framework, which has been defined by Google. SLSA requires security
checks for source code, build process, and code provenance. Many of these
requirements can be included in an automated CI/CD pipeline. To understand how
Google applies these practices internally, see
Google Cloud's approach to change
.
Ensure that application deployments follow approved processes
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.
If an attacker compromises your CI/CD pipeline, your entire application stack
can be affected. To help secure the pipeline, you should enforce an established
approval process before you deploy the code into production.
If you use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), GKE Enterprise, or
Cloud Run, you can establish an approval process by using
Binary Authorization
.
Binary Authorization attaches configurable signatures to container images.
These signatures (also called
attestations
) help to validate the image. At
deployment time, Binary Authorization uses these attestations to determine
whether a process was completed. For example, you can use Binary Authorization
to do the following:
Verify that a specific build system or CI pipeline created a container
image.
Validate that a container image is compliant with a vulnerability
signing policy.
Verify that a container image passes the criteria for promotion to the
next deployment environment, such as from development to QA.
By using Binary Authorization, you can enforce that only trusted code runs on
your target platforms.
Scan for known vulnerabilities before application deployment
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.
We recommend that you use automated tools that can continuously perform
vulnerability scans on application artifacts before they're deployed to
production.
For containerized applications, use
Artifact Analysis
to automatically run vulnerability scans for container images.
Artifact Analysis scans new images when they're uploaded to
Artifact Registry
.
The scan extracts information about the system packages in the container. After
the initial scan, Artifact Analysis continuously monitors the metadata
of scanned images in Artifact Registry for new vulnerabilities. When
Artifact Analysis receives new and updated vulnerability information
from
vulnerability sources
,
it does the following:
Updates the metadata of the scanned images to keep them up to date.
Creates new vulnerability occurrences for new notes.
Deletes vulnerability occurrences that are no longer valid.
Monitor your application code for known vulnerabilities
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.
Use automated tools to constantly monitor your application code for known
vulnerabilities such as the
OWASP Top 10
.
For more information about Google Cloud products and features that support
OWASP Top 10 mitigation techniques, see
OWASP Top 10 mitigation options on Google Cloud
.
Use
Web Security Scanner
to help identify security vulnerabilities in your App Engine,
Compute Engine, and GKE web applications. The scanner
crawls your application, follows all of the links within the scope of your
starting URLs, and attempts to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers
as possible. It can automatically scan for and detect common vulnerabilities,
including
cross-site scripting
,
code injection
,
mixed content
,
and outdated or insecure libraries. Web Security Scanner provides early
identification of these types of vulnerabilities without distracting you with
false positives.
In addition, if you use GKE Enterprise to manage fleets of
Kubernetes clusters, the security posture dashboard shows opinionated,
actionable recommendations to help improve your fleet's security posture.

Implement zero trust
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you ensure comprehensive security across your cloud workloads. The principle
of zero trust emphasizes the following practices:
Eliminating implicit trust
Applying the principle of least privilege to access control
Enforcing explicit validation of all access requests
Adopting an
assume-breach
mindset to enable continuous verification and
security posture monitoring
Principle overview
The
zero-trust
model shifts the security focus from perimeter-based security
to an approach where no user or device is considered to be inherently
trustworthy. Instead, every access request must be verified, regardless of its
origin. This approach involves authenticating and authorizing every user and
device, validating their context (location and device posture), and granting
least privilege access to only the necessary resources.
Implementing the zero-trust model helps your organization enhance its
security posture by minimizing the impact of potential breaches and protecting
sensitive data and applications against unauthorized access. The zero-trust
model helps you ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and
resources in the cloud.
Recommendations
To implement the zero-trust model for your cloud workloads, consider the
recommendations in the following sections:
Secure your network
Verify every access attempt explicitly
Monitor and maintain your network
Secure your network
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Infrastructure security.
Transitioning from conventional perimeter-based security to a zero-trust model
requires multiple steps. Your organization might have already integrated certain
zero-trust controls into its security posture. However, a zero-trust model
isn't a singular product or solution. Instead, it's a holistic integration of
multiple security layers and best practices. This section describes
recommendations and techniques to implement zero trust for network security.
Access control
: Enforce access controls based on user identity and
context by using solutions like
Chrome Enterprise Premium
and
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)
.
By doing this, you shift security from the network perimeter to individual
users and devices. This approach enables granular access control and
reduces the attack surface.
Network security
: Secure network connections between your
on-premises, Google Cloud, and multicloud environments.
Use the private connectivity methods from
Cloud Interconnect
and
IPsec VPNs
.
To help secure access to Google Cloud services and APIs, use
Private Service Connect
.
To help secure outbound access from workloads deployed on
GKE Enterprise
,
use
Cloud Service Mesh egress gateways
.
Network design
: Prevent potential security risks by deleting default
networks in existing projects and disabling the creation of default
networks in new projects.
To avoid conflicts, plan your network and IP address allocation
carefully.
To enforce effective access control, limit
the number of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks per project.
Segmentation
: Isolate workloads but maintain centralized network
management.
To segment your network, use
Shared VPC
.
Define firewall policies and rules at the organization, folder, and VPC
network levels.
To prevent
data exfiltration
,
establish secure perimeters around sensitive data and services by using
VPC Service Controls
.
Perimeter security
: Protect against DDoS attacks and web application
threats.
To protect against threats, use
Google Cloud Armor
.
Configure security policies to allow, deny, or redirect traffic at the
Google Cloud edge.
Automation
: Automate infrastructure provisioning by embracing
infrastructure as code (IaC) principles and by using tools like Terraform,
Jenkins, and
Cloud Build
.
IaC helps to ensure consistent security configurations, simplified
deployments, and rapid rollbacks in case of issues.
Secure foundation
: Establish a secure application environment by
using the
Enterprise foundations blueprint
.
This blueprint provides prescriptive guidance and automation scripts to
help you implement security best practices and configure your
Google Cloud resources securely.
Verify every access attempt explicitly
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Identity and access management
Security operations (SecOps)
Logging, auditing, and monitoring
Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for any user,
device, or service that attempts to access your cloud resources. Don't rely on
location or network perimeter as a security control. Don't automatically trust
any user, device, or service, even if they are already inside the network.
Instead, every attempt to access resources must be rigorously authenticated and
authorized. You must implement strong identity verification measures, such as
multi-factor authentication (MFA). You must also ensure that access decisions
are based on granular policies that consider various contextual factors like
user role, device posture, and location.
To implement this recommendation, use the following methods, tools, and
technologies:
Unified identity management
: Ensure consistent identity management
across your organization by using a single identity provider (IdP).
Google Cloud supports federation with most IdPs, including
on-premises
Active Directory
.
Federation lets you extend your existing identity management infrastructure
to Google Cloud and enable single sign-on (SSO) for users.
If you don't have an existing IdP, consider using
Cloud Identity Premium
or
Google Workspace
.
Limited service account permissions
: Use
service accounts
carefully, and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
Grant only the
necessary permissions required for each service account to perform its
designated tasks.
Use
Workload Identity Federation
for applications that run on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or run outside
Google Cloud to access resources securely.
Robust processes
: Update your identity processes to align with cloud
security best practices.
To help ensure compliance with regulatory
requirements, implement identity governance to track access, risks, and
policy violations.
Review and update your existing processes for granting
and auditing access-control roles and permissions.
Strong authentication
: Implement SSO for user authentication and
implement MFA for privileged accounts.
Google Cloud supports various
MFA methods, including
Titan Security Keys
,
for enhanced security.
For workload authentication, use OAuth 2.0 or signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
Least privilege
: Minimize the risk of unauthorized access and data
breaches by enforcing the principles of least privilege and separation of
duties.
Avoid overprovisioning user access.
Consider implementing just-in-time privileged access for sensitive
operations.
Logging
: Enable audit logging for administrator and data access
activities.
For analysis and threat detection, scan the logs by using
Security Command Center Enterprise
or
Google Security Operations
.
Configure appropriate log retention policies to balance security needs
with storage costs.
Monitor and maintain your network
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Logging, auditing, and monitoring
Application security
Security operations (SecOps)
Infrastructure security
When you plan and implement security measures, assume that an attacker is
already inside your environment. This proactive approach involves using the following
multiple tools and techniques to provide visibility into your network:
Centralized logging and monitoring
: Collect and
analyze security logs from all of your cloud resources through centralized
logging and monitoring
.
Establish baselines for normal network behavior, detect anomalies, and
identify potential threats.
Continuously analyze network traffic flows to identify suspicious patterns
and potential attacks.
Insights into network performance and security
: Use tools like
Network Analyzer
.
Monitor traffic for unusual protocols, unexpected connections, or sudden spikes
in data transfer, which could indicate malicious activity.
Vulnerability scanning and remediation
: Regularly scan your network and applications for vulnerabilities.
Use
Web Security Scanner
,
which can automatically identify vulnerabilities in your Compute Engine
instances, containers, and GKE clusters.
Prioritize remediation based on the severity of vulnerabilities and their
potential impact on your systems.
Intrusion detection
: Monitor network traffic for malicious activity and
automatically block or get alerts for suspicious events by using
Cloud IDS
and
Cloud NGFW intrusion prevention service
.
Security analysis
: Consider implementing
Google SecOps
to correlate security events from various sources, provide real-time analysis of
security alerts, and facilitate incident response.
Consistent configurations
: Ensure that you have consistent security
configurations across your network by using configuration management tools.

Meet regulatory, compliance, and privacy needs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you identify and meet regulatory, compliance, and privacy requirements for
cloud deployments. These requirements influence many of the decisions that you need
to make about the security controls that must be used for your workloads in
Google Cloud.
Principle overview
Meeting regulatory, compliance, and privacy needs is an unavoidable challenge
for all businesses. Cloud regulatory requirements depend on several factors,
including the following:
The laws and regulations that apply to your organization's physical locations
The laws and regulations that apply to your customers' physical locations
Your industry's regulatory requirements
Privacy regulations define how you can obtain, process, store, and manage your
users' data. You own your own data, including the data that you receive from your
users. Therefore, many privacy controls are your responsibility, including controls
for cookies, session management, and obtaining user permission.
The recommendations to implement this principle are grouped within the following
sections:
Recommendations to address organizational risks
Recommendations to address regulatory and compliance obligations
Recommendations to manage your data sovereignty
Recommendations to address privacy requirements
Recommendations to address organizational risks
This section provides recommendations to help you identify and address risks to
your organization.
Identify risks to your organization
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Before you create and deploy resources on Google Cloud, complete a risk
assessment. This assessment should determine the security features that you need
to meet your internal security requirements and external regulatory
requirements.
Your risk assessment provides you with a catalog of organization-specific risks,
and informs you about your organization's capability to detect and counteract
security threats. You must perform a risk analysis immediately after deployment
and whenever there are changes in your business needs, regulatory requirements,
or threats to your organization.
As mentioned in the
Implement security by design
principle, your security risks in a cloud environment differ from on-premises
risks. This difference is due to the shared responsibility model in the cloud,
which varies by service (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) and your usage. Use a
cloud-specific risk assessment framework like the
Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
.
Use threat modeling, like
OWASP application threat modeling
,
to identify and address vulnerabilities. For expert help with risk assessments,
contact your Google account representative or consult Google Cloud's
partner directory
.
After you catalog your risks, you must determine how to address them—that is,
whether you want to accept, avoid, transfer, or mitigate the risks. For
mitigation controls that you can implement, see the next section about mitigating
your risks.
Mitigate your risks
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
When you adopt new public cloud services, you can mitigate risks by using
technical controls, contractual protections, and third-party verifications or
attestations.
Technical controls
are features and technologies that you use to protect your
environment. These include built-in cloud security controls like firewalls and
logging. Technical controls can also include using third-party tools to
reinforce or support your security strategy. There are two categories of
technical controls:
You can implement Google Cloud's security controls to help you
mitigate the risks that apply to your environment. For example, you can
secure the connection between your on-premises networks and your cloud
networks by using
Cloud VPN
and
Cloud Interconnect
.
Google has robust internal controls and auditing to protect against
insider access to customer data. Our audit logs provide you with near
real-time logs of
Google administrator access
on Google Cloud.
Contractual protections
refer to the legal commitments made by us regarding
Google Cloud services. Google is committed to maintaining and expanding
our compliance portfolio. The
Cloud Data Processing Addendum (CDPA)
describes our commitments with regard to the processing and security of your
data. The CDPA also outlines the access controls that limit Google support
engineers' access to customers' environments, and it describes our rigorous
logging and approval process. We recommend that you review Google Cloud's
contractual controls with your legal and regulatory experts, and verify that
they meet your requirements. If you need more information,
contact your technical account representative
.
Third-party verifications or attestations
refer to having a third-party
vendor audit the cloud provider to ensure that the provider meets compliance
requirements. For example, to learn about Google Cloud attestations with
regard to the ISO/IEC 27017 guidelines, see
ISO/IEC 27017 - Compliance
.
To view the current Google Cloud certifications and letters of
attestation, see
Compliance resource center
.
Recommendations to address regulatory and compliance obligations
A typical compliance journey has three stages: assessment, gap remediation, and
continual monitoring. This section provides recommendations that you can use
during each of these stages.
Assess your compliance needs
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Compliance assessment starts with a thorough review of all of your regulatory
obligations and how your business is implementing them. To help you with your
assessment of Google Cloud services, use the
Compliance resource center
.
This site provides information about the following:
Service support for various regulations
Google Cloud certifications and attestations
To better understand the compliance lifecycle at Google and how your
requirements can be met, you can
contact sales
to request help from a Google compliance specialist. Or, you can contact your
Google Cloud account manager to request a compliance workshop.
For more information about tools and resources that you can use to manage
security and compliance for Google Cloud workloads, see
Assuring Compliance in the Cloud
.
Automate implementation of compliance requirements
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
To help you stay in compliance with changing regulations, determine whether you
can automate how you implement compliance requirements. You can use both
compliance-focused capabilities that Google Cloud provides and blueprints
that use recommended configurations for a particular compliance regime.
Assured Workloads
builds on the controls within Google Cloud to help you meet your
compliance obligations. Assured Workloads lets you do the following:
Select your compliance regime. Then, the tool automatically sets the
baseline personnel access controls for the selected regime.
Set the location for your data by using organization policies so that
your data at rest and your resources remain only in that
region
.
Select the key-management option (such as the key rotation period) that
best meets your security and compliance requirements.
Select the access criteria for Google support personnel to meet certain
regulatory requirements such as FedRAMP Moderate. For example, you can
select whether Google support personnel have completed the appropriate
background checks.
Use Google-owned and Google-owned and Google-managed encryption key that are FIPS-140-2
compliant and support FedRAMP Moderate compliance. For an added layer of
control and for the separation of duties, you can use customer-managed
encryption keys (CMEK). For more information about keys, see
Encrypt data at rest and in transit
.
In addition to Assured Workloads, you can use Google Cloud
blueprints that are relevant to your compliance regime. You can modify these
blueprints to incorporate your security policies into your infrastructure
deployments.
To help you build an environment that supports your compliance requirements,
Google's blueprints and solution guides include recommended configurations and
provide Terraform modules. The following table lists blueprints that address
security and alignment with compliance requirements.

Monitor your compliance
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
Logging, monitoring, and auditing
Most regulations require that you monitor particular activities, which include
access-related activities. To help with your monitoring, you can use the
following:
Access Transparency
:
View near real-time logs when Google Cloud administrators access your
content.
Firewall Rules Logging
:
Record TCP and UDP connections inside a VPC network for any rules that you
create. These logs can be useful for auditing network access or for
providing early warning that the network is being used in an unapproved manner.
VPC Flow Logs
:
Record network traffic flows that are sent or received by VM instances.
Security Command Center Premium
:
Monitor for compliance with various standards.
OSSEC
(or another open source tool): Log the activity of individuals who have
administrator access to your environment.
Key Access Justifications
:
View the reasons for a key-access request.
Security Command Center notifications
:
Get alerts when noncompliance issues occur.
For example, get alerts when users disable two-step verification or when
service accounts are over-privileged.
You can also set up automatic remediation for specific notifications.
Recommendations to manage your data sovereignty
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Data sovereignty provides you with a mechanism to prevent Google from accessing
your data. You approve access only for provider behaviors that you agree are
necessary. For example, you can manage your data sovereignty in the following
ways:
Store and manage
encryption keys
outside the cloud.
Grant access to these keys based on detailed
access justifications
.
Protect data in use
by using Confidential Computing.
Manage your operational sovereignty
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Operational sovereignty provides you with assurances that Google personnel can't
compromise your workloads. For example, you can manage operational sovereignty
in the following ways:
Restrict the deployment
of new resources to specific provider regions.
Limit Google personnel access
based on predefined attributes such as their citizenship or geographic location.
Manage software sovereignty
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Software sovereignty provides you with assurances that you can control the
availability of your workloads and run them wherever you want. Also, you can
have this control without being dependent or locked in with a single cloud
provider. Software sovereignty includes the ability to survive events that
require you to quickly change where your workloads are deployed and what level
of outside connection is allowed.
For example, to help you manage your software sovereignty, Google Cloud
supports
hybrid and multicloud deployments
.
In addition,
GKE Enterprise
lets you manage and deploy your applications in both cloud environments and
on-premises environments. If you choose on-premises deployments for data
sovereignty reasons,
Google Distributed Cloud
is a combination of hardware and software that brings Google Cloud into
your data center.
Recommendations to address privacy requirements
Google Cloud includes the following controls that promote privacy:
Default encryption of all data when it's at rest, when it's in transit,
and while it's being processed.
Safeguards against insider access.
Support for numerous privacy regulations.
The following recommendations address additional controls that you can
implement. For more information, see
Privacy Resource Center
.
Control data residency
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Data residency describes where your data is stored at rest. Data residency
requirements vary based on system design objectives, industry regulatory
concerns, national law, tax implications, and even culture.
Controlling data residency starts with the following:
Understand your data type and its location.
Determine what risks exist for your data and which laws and regulations
apply.
Control where your data is stored or where it goes.
To help you comply with data residency requirements, Google Cloud lets
you control where your data is stored, how it's accessed, and how it's
processed. You can use
resource location policies
to restrict where resources are created and to limit where data is replicated
between regions. You can use the location property of a resource to identify
where the service is deployed and who maintains it. For more information, see
Resource locations supported services
.
Classify your confidential data
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Data security.
You must define what data is confidential, and then ensure that the confidential
data is properly protected. Confidential data can include credit card numbers,
addresses, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII).
Using
Sensitive Data Protection
,
you can set up appropriate classifications. You can then tag and tokenize your
data before you store it in Google Cloud. Additionally,
Dataplex offers a
catalog
service that provides a platform for storing, managing, and accessing your
metadata. For more information and an example of data classification and
de-identification, see
De-identification and re-identification of PII using Sensitive Data Protection
.
Lock down access to sensitive data
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Data security
Identity and access management
Place sensitive data in its own service perimeter by using
VPC Service Controls
.
VPC Service Controls improves your ability to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
copying or transferring of data (data exfiltration) from Google-managed
services. With VPC Service Controls, you configure security perimeters around the
resources of your Google-managed services to control the movement of data across
the perimeter. Set
Google Identity and Access Management (IAM)
access controls for that data. Configure
multifactor authentication (MFA)
for all users who require access to sensitive data.

The Security, Privacy and Compliance pillar in the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you design, deploy, and operate cloud workloads
that meet your requirements for security, privacy, and compliance.
This document is designed to offer valuable insights and meet the needs of a
range of security professionals and engineers. The following table describes
the intended audiences for this document:
Audience
What this document provides
Chief information security officers (CISOs), business unit leaders,
and IT managers
A general framework to establish and maintain security excellence in
the cloud and to ensure a comprehensive view of security areas to
make informed decisions about security investments.
Security architects and engineers
Key security practices for the design and operational phases to help
ensure that solutions are designed for security, efficiency, and
scalability.
DevSecOps teams
Guidance to incorporate overarching security controls to plan
automation that enables secure and reliable infrastructure.
Compliance officers and risk managers
Key security recommendations to follow a structured approach to risk
management with safeguards that help to meet compliance
obligations.
To ensure that your Google Cloud workloads meet your security, privacy,
and compliance requirements, all of the stakeholders in your organization must
adopt a collaborative approach. In addition, you must recognize that cloud
security is a shared responsibility between you and Google. For more
information, see
Shared responsibilities and shared fate on Google Cloud
.
The recommendations in this pillar are grouped into core security principles.
Each principle-based recommendation is mapped to one or more of the key
deployment
focus areas of cloud security
that might be critical to your organization. Each
recommendation highlights guidance about the use and configuration of
Google Cloud products and capabilities to help improve your organization's
security posture.
Core principles
The recommendations in this pillar are grouped within the following core
principles of security. Every principle in this pillar is important. Depending
on the requirements of your organization and workload, you might choose to
prioritize certain principles.
Implement security by design
:
Integrate cloud security and network security considerations starting from
the initial design phase of your applications and infrastructure.
Google Cloud provides architecture blueprints and recommendations to
help you apply this principle.
Implement zero trust
:
Use a
never trust, always verify
approach, where access to resources is
granted based on continuous verification of trust. Google Cloud
supports this principle through products like Chrome Enterprise Premium and
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).
Implement shift-left security
:
Implement security controls early in the software development lifecycle.
Avoid security defects before system changes are made. Detect and fix
security bugs early, fast, and reliably after the system changes are
committed. Google Cloud supports this principle through products like
Cloud Build, Binary Authorization, and Artifact Registry.
Implement preemptive cyber defense
:
Adopt a proactive approach to security by implementing robust fundamental
measures like threat intelligence. This approach helps you build a
foundation for more effective threat detection and response.
Google Cloud's
approach to layered security controls
aligns with this principle.
Use AI securely and responsibly
:
Develop and deploy AI systems in a responsible and secure manner. The
recommendations for this principle are aligned with guidance in the
AI and ML perspective
of the Well-Architected Framework and in Google's
Secure AI Framework (SAIF)
.
Use AI for security
:
Use AI capabilities to improve your existing security systems and processes
through
Gemini in Security
and overall platform-security capabilities. Use AI as a tool to increase
the automation of remedial work and ensure security hygiene to make other
systems more secure.
Meet regulatory, compliance, and privacy needs
:
Adhere to industry-specific regulations, compliance standards, and privacy
requirements. Google Cloud helps you meet these obligations through
products like Assured Workloads, Organization Policy Service, and our
compliance resource center
.
Organizational security mindset
A security-focused organizational mindset is crucial for successful cloud
adoption and operation. This mindset should be deeply ingrained in your
organization's culture and reflected in its practices, which are guided by core
security principles as described earlier.
An organizational security mindset emphasizes that you think about security
during system design, assume zero trust, and integrate security features
throughout your development process. In this mindset, you also think proactively
about cyber-defense measures, use AI securely and for security, and consider
your regulatory, privacy, and compliance requirements. By embracing these
principles, your organization can cultivate a security-first culture that
proactively addresses threats, protects valuable assets, and helps to ensure
responsible technology usage.

Implement security by design
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to incorporate robust security features, controls, and
practices into the design of your cloud applications, services, and platforms.
From ideation to operations, security is more effective when it's embedded as an
integral part of every stage of your design process.
Principle overview
As explained in
An Overview of Google's Commitment to Secure by Design
,
secure by default
and
secure by design
are often used interchangeably, but
they represent distinct approaches to building secure systems. Both approaches
aim to minimize vulnerabilities and enhance security, but they differ in scope
and implementation:
Secure by default
: focuses on ensuring that a system's default
settings are set to a secure mode, minimizing the need for users or
administrators to take actions to secure the system. This approach aims to
provide a baseline level of security for all users.
Secure by design
: emphasizes proactively incorporating security
considerations throughout a system's development lifecycle. This approach
is about anticipating potential threats and vulnerabilities early and
making design choices that mitigate risks. This approach involves using
secure coding practices, conducting security reviews, and embedding
security throughout the design process. The secure-by-design approach is an
overarching philosophy that guides the development process and helps to ensure
that security isn't an afterthought but is an integral part of a system's design.
Recommendations
To implement the secure by design principle for your cloud workloads, consider
the recommendations in the following sections:
Choose system components that help to secure your workloads
Build a layered security approach
Use hardened and attested infrastructure and services
Encrypt data at rest and in transit
Choose system components that help to secure your workloads
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
A fundamental decision for effective security is the selection of robust system
components—including both hardware and software components—that constitute
your platform, solution, or service. To reduce the security attack surface and
limit potential damage, you must also carefully consider the deployment patterns
of these components and their configurations.
In your application code, we recommend that you use straightforward, safe, and
reliable libraries, abstractions, and application frameworks in order to eliminate
classes of vulnerabilities. To scan for vulnerabilities in software libraries,
you can use third-party tools. You can also use
Assured Open Source Software
,
which helps to reduce risks to your software supply chain by using open source
software (OSS) packages that Google uses and secures.
Your infrastructure must use networking, storage, and compute options that
support safe operation and align with your security requirements and risk
acceptance levels. Infrastructure security is important for both internet-facing
and internal workloads.
For information about other Google solutions that support this recommendation,
see
Implement shift-left security
.
Build a layered security approach
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
AI and ML security
Infrastructure security
Identity and access management
Data security
We recommend that you implement security at each layer of your application and
infrastructure stack by applying a defense-in-depth approach.
Use the security features in each component of your platform. To limit access
and identify the boundaries of the potential impact (that is, the
blast radius
)
in the event of a security incident, do the following:
Simplify your system's design to accommodate flexibility where possible.
Document the security requirements of each component.
Incorporate a robust secured mechanism to address resiliency and recovery
requirements.
When you design the security layers, perform a risk assessment to determine the
security features that you need in order to meet internal security requirements
and external regulatory requirements. We recommend that you use an
industry-standard risk assessment framework that applies to cloud environments
and that is relevant to your regulatory requirements. For example, the Cloud
Security Alliance (CSA) provides the
Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
.
Your risk assessment provides you with a catalog of risks and corresponding
security controls to mitigate them.
When you perform the risk assessment, remember that you have a shared
responsibility arrangement with your cloud provider. Therefore, your risks in a
cloud environment differ from your risks in an on-premises environment. For
example, in an on-premises environment, you need to mitigate vulnerabilities to
your hardware stack. In contrast, in a cloud environment, the cloud provider
bears these risks. Also, remember that the boundaries of shared responsibilities
differ between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services for each cloud provider.
After you identify potential risks, you must design and create a mitigation
plan that uses technical, administrative, and operational controls, as well as
contractual protections and third-party attestations. In addition, a threat
modeling method, such as the
OWASP application threat modeling method
,
helps you to identify potential gaps and suggest actions to address the gaps.
Use hardened and attested infrastructure and services
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
A mature security program mitigates new vulnerabilities as described in
security bulletins. The security program should also provide remediation to fix
vulnerabilities in existing deployments and secure your VM and container
images. You can use hardening guides that are specific to the OS and application
of your images, as well as benchmarks like the one provided by the
Center of Internet Security (CIS)
.
If you use custom images for your Compute Engine VMs, you need to patch the
images yourself. Alternatively, you can use Google-provided
curated OS images
,
which are patched regularly. To run containers on Compute Engine VMs, use
Google-curated
Container-optimized OS images
.
Google regularly patches and updates these images.
If you use GKE, we recommend that you enable
node auto-upgrades
so that Google updates your cluster nodes with the latest patches. Google
manages GKE control planes, which are automatically updated
and patched. To further reduce the attack surface of your containers, you can
use
distroless images
.
Distroless images are ideal for security-sensitive applications, microservices,
and situations where minimizing the image size and attack surface is
paramount.
For sensitive workloads, use
Shielded VM
,
which prevents malicious code from being loaded during the VM boot cycle.
Shielded VM instances provide boot security, monitor integrity, and use
the
Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM)
.
To help secure SSH access,
OS Login
lets your employees connect to your VMs by using
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
as the source of truth instead of relying on SSH keys. Therefore, you don't need
to manage SSH keys throughout your organization. OS Login ties an
administrator's access to their employee lifecycle, so when employees change
roles or leave your organization, their access is revoked with their account. OS
Login also supports
Google two-factor authentication
,
which adds an extra layer of security against account takeover attacks.
In GKE, application instances run within Docker
containers. To enable a defined risk profile and to restrict employees from
making changes to containers, ensure that your containers are stateless and
immutable. The immutability principle means that your employees don't modify the
container or access it interactively. If the container must be changed, you
build a new image and redeploy that image. Enable SSH access to the underlying
containers only in specific debugging scenarios.
To help globally secure configurations across your environment, you can use
organization policies
to set constraints or guardrails on resources that affect the behavior of your
cloud assets. For example, you can define the following organization policies
and apply them either globally across a Google Cloud organization or
selectively at the level of a folder or project:
Disable external IP address allocation to VMs.
Restrict resource creation to specific geographical locations.
Disable the creation of Service Accounts or their keys.
Encrypt data at rest and in transit
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Infrastructure security
Data security
Data encryption is a foundational control to protect sensitive information, and
it's a key part of
data governance
.
An effective data protection strategy includes access control, data segmentation
and geographical residency, auditing,
and
encryption implementation that's
based on a careful assessment of requirements.
By default, Google Cloud
encrypts customer data that's stored at rest
,
with no action required from you. In addition to default encryption,
Google Cloud provides options for envelope encryption and encryption key
management. You must identify the solutions that best fit your requirements for
key generation, storage, and rotation, whether you're choosing the keys for your
storage, for compute, or for big data workloads. For example,
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEKs)
can be created in
Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS)
.
The CMEKs can be either software-based or
HSM-protected
to meet your regulatory or compliance requirements, such as the need to rotate
encryption keys regularly. Cloud KMS Autokey lets you automate the
provisioning and assignment of CMEKs. In addition, you can bring your own keys
that are sourced from a third-party key management system by using
Cloud External Key Manager (Cloud EKM)
.
We strongly recommend that data be encrypted in-transit.
Google encrypts and authenticates data in transit
at one or more network layers when data moves outside physical boundaries that
aren't controlled by Google or on behalf of Google. All VM-to-VM traffic within
a VPC network and between peered VPC networks is encrypted. You can use
MACsec
for encryption of traffic over Cloud Interconnect connections. IPsec provides
encryption for traffic over
Cloud VPN
connections. You can protect application-to-application traffic in the cloud by
using security features like
TLS and mTLS configurations in Apigee
and
Cloud Service Mesh
for containerized applications.
By default, Google Cloud encrypts data at rest and data in transit across
the network. However, data isn't encrypted by default while it's in use in
memory. If your organization handles confidential data, you need to mitigate any
threats that undermine the confidentiality and integrity of either the
application or the data in system memory. To mitigate these threats, you can use
Confidential Computing, which provides a trusted execution environment for your
compute workloads. For more information, see
Confidential VM overview
.
Implement zero trust
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you ensure comprehensive security across your cloud workloads. The principle
of zero trust emphasizes the following practices:
Eliminating implicit trust
Applying the principle of least privilege to access control
Enforcing explicit validation of all access requests
Adopting an
assume-breach
mindset to enable continuous verification and
security posture monitoring
Principle overview
The
zero-trust
model shifts the security focus from perimeter-based security
to an approach where no user or device is considered to be inherently
trustworthy. Instead, every access request must be verified, regardless of its
origin. This approach involves authenticating and authorizing every user and
device, validating their context (location and device posture), and granting
least privilege access to only the necessary resources.
Implementing the zero-trust model helps your organization enhance its
security posture by minimizing the impact of potential breaches and protecting
sensitive data and applications against unauthorized access. The zero-trust
model helps you ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and
resources in the cloud.
Recommendations
To implement the zero-trust model for your cloud workloads, consider the
recommendations in the following sections:
Secure your network
Verify every access attempt explicitly
Monitor and maintain your network
Secure your network
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Infrastructure security.
Transitioning from conventional perimeter-based security to a zero-trust model
requires multiple steps. Your organization might have already integrated certain
zero-trust controls into its security posture. However, a zero-trust model
isn't a singular product or solution. Instead, it's a holistic integration of
multiple security layers and best practices. This section describes
recommendations and techniques to implement zero trust for network security.
Access control
: Enforce access controls based on user identity and
context by using solutions like
Chrome Enterprise Premium
and
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)
.
By doing this, you shift security from the network perimeter to individual
users and devices. This approach enables granular access control and
reduces the attack surface.
Network security
: Secure network connections between your
on-premises, Google Cloud, and multicloud environments.
Use the private connectivity methods from
Cloud Interconnect
and
IPsec VPNs
.
To help secure access to Google Cloud services and APIs, use
Private Service Connect
.
To help secure outbound access from workloads deployed on
GKE Enterprise
,
use
Cloud Service Mesh egress gateways
.
Network design
: Prevent potential security risks by deleting default
networks in existing projects and disabling the creation of default
networks in new projects.
To avoid conflicts, plan your network and IP address allocation
carefully.
To enforce effective access control, limit
the number of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks per project.
Segmentation
: Isolate workloads but maintain centralized network
management.
To segment your network, use
Shared VPC
.
Define firewall policies and rules at the organization, folder, and VPC
network levels.
To prevent
data exfiltration
,
establish secure perimeters around sensitive data and services by using
VPC Service Controls
.
Perimeter security
: Protect against DDoS attacks and web application
threats.
To protect against threats, use
Google Cloud Armor
.
Configure security policies to allow, deny, or redirect traffic at the
Google Cloud edge.
Automation
: Automate infrastructure provisioning by embracing
infrastructure as code (IaC) principles and by using tools like Terraform,
Jenkins, and
Cloud Build
.
IaC helps to ensure consistent security configurations, simplified
deployments, and rapid rollbacks in case of issues.
Secure foundation
: Establish a secure application environment by
using the
Enterprise foundations blueprint
.
This blueprint provides prescriptive guidance and automation scripts to
help you implement security best practices and configure your
Google Cloud resources securely.
Verify every access attempt explicitly
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Identity and access management
Security operations (SecOps)
Logging, auditing, and monitoring
Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for any user,
device, or service that attempts to access your cloud resources. Don't rely on
location or network perimeter as a security control. Don't automatically trust
any user, device, or service, even if they are already inside the network.
Instead, every attempt to access resources must be rigorously authenticated and
authorized. You must implement strong identity verification measures, such as
multi-factor authentication (MFA). You must also ensure that access decisions
are based on granular policies that consider various contextual factors like
user role, device posture, and location.
To implement this recommendation, use the following methods, tools, and
technologies:
Unified identity management
: Ensure consistent identity management
across your organization by using a single identity provider (IdP).
Google Cloud supports federation with most IdPs, including
on-premises
Active Directory
.
Federation lets you extend your existing identity management infrastructure
to Google Cloud and enable single sign-on (SSO) for users.
If you don't have an existing IdP, consider using
Cloud Identity Premium
or
Google Workspace
.
Limited service account permissions
: Use
service accounts
carefully, and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
Grant only the
necessary permissions required for each service account to perform its
designated tasks.
Use
Workload Identity Federation
for applications that run on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or run outside
Google Cloud to access resources securely.
Robust processes
: Update your identity processes to align with cloud
security best practices.
To help ensure compliance with regulatory
requirements, implement identity governance to track access, risks, and
policy violations.
Review and update your existing processes for granting
and auditing access-control roles and permissions.
Strong authentication
: Implement SSO for user authentication and
implement MFA for privileged accounts.
Google Cloud supports various
MFA methods, including
Titan Security Keys
,
for enhanced security.
For workload authentication, use OAuth 2.0 or signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
Least privilege
: Minimize the risk of unauthorized access and data
breaches by enforcing the principles of least privilege and separation of
duties.
Avoid overprovisioning user access.
Consider implementing just-in-time privileged access for sensitive
operations.
Logging
: Enable audit logging for administrator and data access
activities.
For analysis and threat detection, scan the logs by using
Security Command Center Enterprise
or
Google Security Operations
.
Configure appropriate log retention policies to balance security needs
with storage costs.
Monitor and maintain your network
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Logging, auditing, and monitoring
Application security
Security operations (SecOps)
Infrastructure security
When you plan and implement security measures, assume that an attacker is
already inside your environment. This proactive approach involves using the following
multiple tools and techniques to provide visibility into your network:
Centralized logging and monitoring
: Collect and
analyze security logs from all of your cloud resources through centralized
logging and monitoring
.
Establish baselines for normal network behavior, detect anomalies, and
identify potential threats.
Continuously analyze network traffic flows to identify suspicious patterns
and potential attacks.
Insights into network performance and security
: Use tools like
Network Analyzer
.
Monitor traffic for unusual protocols, unexpected connections, or sudden spikes
in data transfer, which could indicate malicious activity.
Vulnerability scanning and remediation
: Regularly scan your network and applications for vulnerabilities.
Use
Web Security Scanner
,
which can automatically identify vulnerabilities in your Compute Engine
instances, containers, and GKE clusters.
Prioritize remediation based on the severity of vulnerabilities and their
potential impact on your systems.
Intrusion detection
: Monitor network traffic for malicious activity and
automatically block or get alerts for suspicious events by using
Cloud IDS
and
Cloud NGFW intrusion prevention service
.
Security analysis
: Consider implementing
Google SecOps
to correlate security events from various sources, provide real-time analysis of
security alerts, and facilitate incident response.
Consistent configurations
: Ensure that you have consistent security
configurations across your network by using configuration management tools.
Implement shift-left security
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you identify practical controls that you can implement early in the
software development lifecycle to improve your security posture. It provides
recommendations that help you implement preventive security guardrails and
post-deployment security controls.
Principle overview
Shift-left security
means adopting security practices early in the software
development lifecycle. This principle has the following goals:
Avoid security defects before system changes are made. Implement
preventive security guardrails and adopt practices such as infrastructure
as code (IaC), policy as code, and security checks in the CI/CD pipeline.
You can also use other platform-specific capabilities like
Organization Policy Service
and
hardened GKE clusters
in Google Cloud.
Detect and fix security bugs early, fast, and reliably after any system
changes are committed. Adopt practices like code reviews, post-deployment
vulnerability scanning, and security testing.
The
Implement security by design
and shift-left security principles are related but they differ in scope.
The security-by-design principle helps you to avoid fundamental design flaws that would
require re-architecting the entire system. For example, a threat-modeling
exercise reveals that the current design doesn't include an authorization
policy, and all users would have the same level of access without it. Shift-left
security helps you to avoid implementation defects (bugs and misconfigurations)
before changes are applied, and it enables fast, reliable fixes after deployment.
Recommendations
To implement the shift-left security principle for your cloud workloads,
consider the recommendations in the following sections:
Adopt preventive security controls
Automate provisioning and management of cloud resources
Automate secure application releases
Ensure that application deployments follow approved processes
Scan for known vulnerabilities before application deployment
Monitor your application code for known vulnerabilities
Adopt preventive security controls
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Identity and access management
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
Preventive security controls are crucial for maintaining a strong security
posture in the cloud. These controls help you proactively mitigate risks. You
can prevent misconfigurations and unauthorized access to resources, enable
developers to work efficiently, and help ensure compliance with industry
standards and internal policies.
Preventive security controls are more effective when they're implemented by
using infrastructure as code (IaC). With IaC, preventive security controls can
include more customized checks on the infrastructure code before changes are
deployed. When combined with automation, preventive security controls can run as
part of your CI/CD pipeline's automatic checks.
The following products and Google Cloud capabilities can help you implement
preventive controls in your environment:
Organization Policy Service constraints
:
configure predefined and custom constraints with centralized control.
VPC Service Controls
:
create perimeters around your Google Cloud services.
Identity and Access Management (IAM),
Privileged Access Manager
,
and
principal access boundary policies
:
restrict access to resources.
Policy Controller
and
Open Policy Agent (OPA)
:
enforce IaC constraints in your CI/CD pipeline and avoid cloud
misconfigurations.
IAM lets you authorize
who
can act on specific resources based
on permissions. For more information, see
Access control for organization resources with IAM
.
Organization Policy Service lets you set restrictions on resources to specify how they can
be configured. For example, you can use an organization policy to do the
following:
Limit resource sharing
based on domain.
Limit the use of service accounts
.
Restrict the physical location
of newly created resources.
In addition to using organizational policies, you can restrict access to
resources by using the following methods:
Tags with IAM
:
assign a tag to a set of resources and then set the access definition for
the tag itself, rather than defining the access permissions on each resource.
IAM Conditions
:
define conditional, attribute-based access control for resources.
Defense in depth: use VPC Service Controls to further restrict
access to resources.
For more information about resource management, see
Decide a resource hierarchy for your Google Cloud landing zone
.
Automate provisioning and management of cloud resources
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Application security
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
Automating the provisioning and management of cloud resources and workloads is
more effective when you also adopt declarative IaC, as opposed to imperative
scripting. IaC isn't a security tool or practice on its own, but it helps you
to improve the security of your platform. Adopting IaC lets you create
repeatable infrastructure and provides your operations team with a known good
state. IaC also improves the efficiency of rollbacks, audit changes, and
troubleshooting.
When combined with CI/CD pipelines and automation, IaC also gives you the
ability to adopt practices such as
policy as code
with tools like OPA. You can
audit infrastructure changes over time and run automatic checks on the
infrastructure code before changes are deployed.
To automate the infrastructure deployment, you can use tools like
Config Controller
,
Terraform, Jenkins, and
Cloud Build
.
To help you build a secure application environment using IaC and automation,
Google Cloud provides the
enterprise foundations blueprint
.
This blueprint is Google's opinionated design that follows all of our
recommended practices and configurations. The blueprint provides step-by-step
instructions to configure and deploy your Google Cloud topology by using
Terraform and Cloud Build.
You can modify the scripts of the
enterprise foundations blueprint to configure an environment that follows Google
recommendations and meets your own security requirements. You can further build
on the blueprint with additional blueprints or design your own automation. The
Google Cloud Architecture Center provides other blueprints that can be
implemented on top of the enterprise foundations blueprint. The following are a
few examples of these blueprints:
Deploy an enterprise developer platform on Google Cloud
Deploy a secured serverless architecture using Cloud Run
Build and deploy generative AI and machine learning models in an enterprise
Import data from Google Cloud into a secured BigQuery data warehouse
Automate secure application releases
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.
Without automated tools, it can be difficult to deploy, update, and patch
complex application environments to meet consistent security requirements. We
recommend that you build automated CI/CD pipelines for your software development
lifecycle (SDLC). Automated CI/CD pipelines help you to remove manual errors,
provide standardized development feedback loops, and enable efficient product
iterations. Continuous delivery is one of the best practices that the
DORA framework
recommends.
Automating application releases by using CI/CD pipelines helps to improve your
ability to detect and fix security bugs early, fast, and reliably. For example,
you can scan for security vulnerabilities automatically when artifacts are
created, narrow the scope of security reviews, and roll back to a known and safe
version. You can also define policies for different environments (such as
development, test, or production environments) so that only verified artifacts
are deployed.
To help you automate application releases and embed security checks in your
CI/CD pipeline, Google Cloud provides multiple tools including
Cloud Build
,
Cloud Deploy
,
Web Security Scanner
,
and
Binary Authorization
.
To establish a process that verifies multiple security requirements in your SDLC,
use the
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)
framework, which has been defined by Google. SLSA requires security
checks for source code, build process, and code provenance. Many of these
requirements can be included in an automated CI/CD pipeline. To understand how
Google applies these practices internally, see
Google Cloud's approach to change
.
Ensure that application deployments follow approved processes
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.
If an attacker compromises your CI/CD pipeline, your entire application stack
can be affected. To help secure the pipeline, you should enforce an established
approval process before you deploy the code into production.
If you use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), GKE Enterprise, or
Cloud Run, you can establish an approval process by using
Binary Authorization
.
Binary Authorization attaches configurable signatures to container images.
These signatures (also called
attestations
) help to validate the image. At
deployment time, Binary Authorization uses these attestations to determine
whether a process was completed. For example, you can use Binary Authorization
to do the following:
Verify that a specific build system or CI pipeline created a container
image.
Validate that a container image is compliant with a vulnerability
signing policy.
Verify that a container image passes the criteria for promotion to the
next deployment environment, such as from development to QA.
By using Binary Authorization, you can enforce that only trusted code runs on
your target platforms.
Scan for known vulnerabilities before application deployment
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.
We recommend that you use automated tools that can continuously perform
vulnerability scans on application artifacts before they're deployed to
production.
For containerized applications, use
Artifact Analysis
to automatically run vulnerability scans for container images.
Artifact Analysis scans new images when they're uploaded to
Artifact Registry
.
The scan extracts information about the system packages in the container. After
the initial scan, Artifact Analysis continuously monitors the metadata
of scanned images in Artifact Registry for new vulnerabilities. When
Artifact Analysis receives new and updated vulnerability information
from
vulnerability sources
,
it does the following:
Updates the metadata of the scanned images to keep them up to date.
Creates new vulnerability occurrences for new notes.
Deletes vulnerability occurrences that are no longer valid.
Monitor your application code for known vulnerabilities
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Application security.

starting URLs, and attempts to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers
as possible. It can automatically scan for and detect common vulnerabilities,
including
cross-site scripting
,
code injection
,
mixed content
,
and outdated or insecure libraries. Web Security Scanner provides early
identification of these types of vulnerabilities without distracting you with
false positives.
In addition, if you use GKE Enterprise to manage fleets of
Kubernetes clusters, the security posture dashboard shows opinionated,
actionable recommendations to help improve your fleet's security posture.
Implement preemptive cyber defense
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to build robust cyber-defense programs as part of your
overall security strategy.
This principle emphasizes the use of threat intelligence to proactively guide
your efforts across the core cyber-defense functions, as defined in
The Defender's Advantage: A guide to activating cyber defense
.
Principle overview
When you defend your system against cyber attacks, you have a significant,
underutilized advantage against attackers. As
the founder of Mandiant states
,
"You should know more about your business, your systems, your topology, your
infrastructure than any attacker does. This is an incredible advantage." To
help you use this inherent advantage, this document provides recommendations
about proactive and strategic cyber-defense practices that are mapped to the
Defender's Advantage framework.
Recommendations
To implement preemptive cyber defense for your cloud workloads, consider the
recommendations in the following sections:
Integrate the functions of cyber defense
Use the Intelligence function in all aspects of cyber defense
Understand and capitalize on your defender's advantage
Validate and improve your defenses continuously
Manage and coordinate cyber-defense efforts
Integrate the functions of cyber defense
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
The Defender's Advantage framework identifies six critical functions of
cyber defense:
Intelligence
,
Detect
,
Respond
,
Validate
,
Hunt
, and
Mission Control.
Each function focuses on a unique part of the
cyber-defense mission, but these functions must be well-coordinated and
work together to provide an effective defense. Focus on building a robust
and integrated system where each function supports the others. If you need
a phased approach for adoption, consider the following suggested order.
Depending on your current cloud maturity, resource topology, and specific
threat landscape, you might want to prioritize certain functions.
Intelligence
: The Intelligence function guides all the other
functions. Understanding the threat landscape—including the most likely
attackers, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the
potential impact—is critical to prioritizing actions across the entire
program. The Intelligence function is responsible for stakeholder
identification, definition of intelligence requirements, data collection,
analysis and dissemination, automation, and the creation of a cyber
threat profile.
Detect and Respond
: These functions make up the core of active
defense, which involves identifying and addressing malicious activity.
These functions are necessary to act on the intelligence that's gathered by
the intelligence function. The Detect function requires a methodical
approach that aligns detections to attacker TTPs and ensures robust
logging. The Respond function must focus on initial triage, data
collection, and incident remediation.
Validate
: The Validate function is a continuous process that
provides assurance that your security control ecosystem is up-to-date and
operating as designed. This function ensures that your organization
understands the attack surface, knows where vulnerabilities exist, and
measures the effectiveness of controls. Security validation is also an
important component of the detection engineering lifecycle and must be used
to identify detection gaps and create new detections.
Hunt
: The Hunt function involves proactively searching for active
threats within an environment. This function must be implemented when your
organization has a baseline level of maturity in the Detect and Respond
functions. The Hunt function expands the detection capabilities and helps
to identify gaps and weaknesses in controls. The Hunt function must be
based on specific threats. This advanced function benefits from a
foundation of robust intelligence, detection, and response capabilities.
Mission Control
: The Mission Control function acts as the central
hub that connects all of the other functions. This function is
responsible for strategy, communication, and decisive action across your
cyber-defense program. It ensures that all of the functions are working
together and that they're aligned with your organization's business goals.
You must focus on establishing a clear understanding of the purpose of the
Mission Control function before you use it to connect the other functions.
Use the Intelligence function in all aspects of cyber defense
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
This recommendation highlights the Intelligence function as a core part of a strong
cyber-defense program. Threat intelligence provides knowledge about threat
actors, their TTPs, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). This knowledge should
inform and prioritize actions across all cyber-defense functions. An
intelligence-driven approach helps you align defenses to meet the threats that
are most likely to affect your organization. This approach also helps with
efficient allocation and prioritization of resources.
The following Google Cloud products and features help you take advantage
of threat intelligence to guide your security operations. Use these features to
identify and prioritize potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks, and then
plan and implement appropriate actions.
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps)
helps you store and analyze security data centrally. Use
Google SecOps to map logs into a common model, enrich the
logs, and link the logs to timelines for a comprehensive view of attacks.
You can also create detection rules, set up IoC matching, and perform
threat-hunting activities. The platform also provides curated detections,
which are predefined and managed rules to help identify threats.
Google SecOps can also integrate with
Mandiant frontline intelligence
.
Google SecOps uniquely integrates industry-leading AI, along
with
threat intelligence from Mandiant
and
Google VirusTotal
.
This integration is critical for threat evaluation and understanding who is
targeting your organization and the potential impact.

,
provides visibility into network performance. Network monitoring can also
help you detect unusual traffic patterns or detect data transfer amounts
that might indicate an attack or data exfiltration attempt.
Understand and capitalize on your defender's advantage
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
As mentioned earlier, you have an advantage over attackers when you have
a thorough understanding of your business, systems, topology, and
infrastructure. To capitalize on this knowledge advantage, utilize this data
about your environments during cyberdefense planning.

enriched logs with timelines. This enables defenders to proactively
identify active compromises and adapt defenses based on attackers' behavior.
Network monitoring helps identify irregular network activity that might
indicate an attack and it provides early indicators that you can use to take
action. To help proactively protect your data from theft, continuously monitor
for data exfiltration and use the provided tools.
Validate and improve your defenses continuously
This recommendation is relevant to all of the
focus areas
.
This recommendation emphasizes the importance of targeted testing and
continuous validation of controls to understand strengths and weaknesses
across the entire attack surface. This includes validating the
effectiveness of controls, operations, and staff through methods like the
following:
Penetration tests
Red-blue team
and
purple team
exercises
Tabletop exercises
You must also actively search for threats and use the results to improve
detection and visibility. Use the following tools to continuously test and
validate your defenses against real-world threats:

Use AI securely and responsibly
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you secure your AI systems. These
recommendations are aligned with Google's
Secure AI Framework (SAIF)
,
which provides a practical approach to address the security and risk concerns of
AI systems. SAIF is a conceptual framework that aims to provide industry-wide
standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.
Principle overview
To help ensure that your AI systems meet your security, privacy, and compliance
requirements, you must adopt a holistic strategy that starts with the initial
design and extends to deployment and operations. You can implement this holistic
strategy by applying the
six core elements of SAIF
.
Google uses AI to enhance security measures, such as identifying threats,
automating security tasks, and improving detection capabilities, while keeping
humans in the loop for critical decisions.
Google emphasizes a collaborative approach to advancing AI security. This
approach involves partnering with customers, industries, and governments to
enhance the SAIF guidelines and offer practical, actionable resources.
The recommendations to implement this principle are grouped within the
following sections:
Recommendations to use AI securely
Recommendations for AI governance
Recommendations to use AI securely
To use AI securely, you need both foundational security controls and
AI-specific security controls. This section provides an overview of
recommendations to ensure that your AI and ML deployments meet the security,
privacy, and compliance requirements of your organization.

AI and ML security
This recommendation aligns with the SAIF element about extending detection and
response to bring AI into an organization's threat universe. To prevent issues,
it's critical to manage prompts for generative AI systems, monitor inputs, and
control user access.
Recommendations for AI governance
All of the recommendations in this section are relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Google Cloud offers a robust set of tools and services that you can use
to build responsible and ethical AI systems. We also offer a framework of
policies, procedures, and ethical considerations that can guide the development,
deployment, and use of AI systems.
As reflected in our recommendations, Google's approach for AI governance is
guided by the following principles:
Fairness
Transparency
Accountability
Privacy
Security
Use fairness indicators
Vertex AI
can detect bias during the data collection or post-training evaluation process.
Vertex AI provides
model evaluation metrics
like
data bias
and
model bias
to help you evaluate your model for bias.
These metrics are related to fairness across different categories like race,
gender, and class. However, interpreting statistical deviations isn't a
straightforward exercise, because differences across categories might not be a
result of bias or a signal of harm.
Use Vertex Explainable AI
To understand how the AI models make decisions, use Vertex Explainable AI. This
feature helps you to identify potential biases that might be hidden in the
model's logic.
This explainability feature is integrated with
BigQuery ML
and
Vertex AI
,
which provide feature-based explanations. You can either perform explainability
in BigQuery ML or
register your model
in Vertex AI and perform explainability in
Vertex AI.
Track data lineage
Track the origin and transformation of data that's used in your AI systems.
This tracking helps you understand the data's journey and identify potential
sources of bias or error.
Data lineage
is a Dataplex feature that lets you track how data moves through your
systems: where it comes from, where it's passed to, and what transformations are
applied to it.
Establish accountability
Establish clear responsibility for the development, deployment, and outcomes of
your AI systems.
Use
Cloud Logging
to log key events and decisions made by your AI systems. The logs provide an
audit trail to help you understand how the system is performing and identify
areas for improvement.
Use
Error Reporting
to systematically analyze errors made by the AI systems. This analysis can
reveal patterns that point to underlying biases or areas where the model needs
further refinement.
Implement differential privacy
During model training,
add noise
to the data in order to make it difficult to identify individual data points but
still enable the model to learn effectively. With
SQL in BigQuery
,
you can transform the results of a query with differentially private
aggregations
.
Use AI for security
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to use AI to help you improve the security of your
cloud workloads.
Because of the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks, it's
important to take advantage of AI's potential to help improve security. AI can
help to reduce the number of threats, reduce the manual effort required by security
professionals, and help compensate for the scarcity of experts in the cyber-security
domain.
Principle overview
Use AI capabilities to improve your existing security systems and processes.
You can use
Gemini in Security
as well as the intrinsic AI capabilities that are built into Google Cloud services.
These AI capabilities can transform security by providing assistance across
every stage of the security lifecycle. For example, you can use AI to do the
following:
Analyze and explain potentially malicious code without reverse engineering.
Reduce repetitive work for cyber-security practitioners.
Use natural language to generate queries and interact with security
event data.
Surface contextual information.
Offer recommendations for quick responses.
Aid in the remediation of events.
Summarize high-priority alerts for misconfigurations and
vulnerabilities, highlight potential impacts, and recommend mitigations.
Levels of security autonomy
AI and automation can help you achieve better security outcomes when you're
dealing with ever-evolving cyber-security threats. By using AI for security, you
can achieve greater levels of autonomy to detect and prevent threats and improve
your overall security posture. Google defines four
levels of autonomy
when you use AI for security, and they outline the increasing role of AI in
assisting and eventually leading security tasks:
Manual
: Humans run all of the security tasks (prevent, detect,
prioritize, and respond) across the entire security lifecycle.
Assisted
: AI tools, like Gemini, boost human
productivity by summarizing information, generating insights, and making
recommendations.
Semi-autonomous
: AI takes primary responsibility for many security
tasks and delegates to humans only when required.
Autonomous
: AI acts as a trusted assistant that drives the security
lifecycle based on your organization's goals and preferences, with minimal
human intervention.
Recommendations
The following sections describe the recommendations for using AI for security.

security practices are augmented by AI.
To implement this recommendation, follow the
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)
guidelines for AI artifacts and use validated container images.
Meet regulatory, compliance, and privacy needs
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
helps you identify and meet regulatory, compliance, and privacy requirements for
cloud deployments. These requirements influence many of the decisions that you need
to make about the security controls that must be used for your workloads in
Google Cloud.
Principle overview
Meeting regulatory, compliance, and privacy needs is an unavoidable challenge
for all businesses. Cloud regulatory requirements depend on several factors,
including the following:
The laws and regulations that apply to your organization's physical locations
The laws and regulations that apply to your customers' physical locations
Your industry's regulatory requirements
Privacy regulations define how you can obtain, process, store, and manage your
users' data. You own your own data, including the data that you receive from your
users. Therefore, many privacy controls are your responsibility, including controls
for cookies, session management, and obtaining user permission.
The recommendations to implement this principle are grouped within the following
sections:
Recommendations to address organizational risks
Recommendations to address regulatory and compliance obligations
Recommendations to manage your data sovereignty
Recommendations to address privacy requirements
Recommendations to address organizational risks
This section provides recommendations to help you identify and address risks to
your organization.
Identify risks to your organization
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Before you create and deploy resources on Google Cloud, complete a risk
assessment. This assessment should determine the security features that you need
to meet your internal security requirements and external regulatory
requirements.
Your risk assessment provides you with a catalog of organization-specific risks,
and informs you about your organization's capability to detect and counteract
security threats. You must perform a risk analysis immediately after deployment
and whenever there are changes in your business needs, regulatory requirements,
or threats to your organization.
As mentioned in the
Implement security by design
principle, your security risks in a cloud environment differ from on-premises
risks. This difference is due to the shared responsibility model in the cloud,
which varies by service (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) and your usage. Use a
cloud-specific risk assessment framework like the
Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
.
Use threat modeling, like
OWASP application threat modeling
,
to identify and address vulnerabilities. For expert help with risk assessments,
contact your Google account representative or consult Google Cloud's
partner directory
.
After you catalog your risks, you must determine how to address them—that is,
whether you want to accept, avoid, transfer, or mitigate the risks. For
mitigation controls that you can implement, see the next section about mitigating
your risks.
Mitigate your risks
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
When you adopt new public cloud services, you can mitigate risks by using
technical controls, contractual protections, and third-party verifications or
attestations.
Technical controls
are features and technologies that you use to protect your
environment. These include built-in cloud security controls like firewalls and
logging. Technical controls can also include using third-party tools to
reinforce or support your security strategy. There are two categories of
technical controls:
You can implement Google Cloud's security controls to help you
mitigate the risks that apply to your environment. For example, you can
secure the connection between your on-premises networks and your cloud
networks by using
Cloud VPN
and
Cloud Interconnect
.
Google has robust internal controls and auditing to protect against
insider access to customer data. Our audit logs provide you with near
real-time logs of
Google administrator access
on Google Cloud.
Contractual protections
refer to the legal commitments made by us regarding
Google Cloud services. Google is committed to maintaining and expanding
our compliance portfolio. The
Cloud Data Processing Addendum (CDPA)
describes our commitments with regard to the processing and security of your
data. The CDPA also outlines the access controls that limit Google support
engineers' access to customers' environments, and it describes our rigorous
logging and approval process. We recommend that you review Google Cloud's
contractual controls with your legal and regulatory experts, and verify that
they meet your requirements. If you need more information,
contact your technical account representative
.
Third-party verifications or attestations
refer to having a third-party
vendor audit the cloud provider to ensure that the provider meets compliance
requirements. For example, to learn about Google Cloud attestations with
regard to the ISO/IEC 27017 guidelines, see
ISO/IEC 27017 - Compliance
.
To view the current Google Cloud certifications and letters of
attestation, see
Compliance resource center
.
Recommendations to address regulatory and compliance obligations
A typical compliance journey has three stages: assessment, gap remediation, and
continual monitoring. This section provides recommendations that you can use
during each of these stages.
Assess your compliance needs
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Compliance assessment starts with a thorough review of all of your regulatory
obligations and how your business is implementing them. To help you with your
assessment of Google Cloud services, use the
Compliance resource center
.
This site provides information about the following:
Service support for various regulations
Google Cloud certifications and attestations
To better understand the compliance lifecycle at Google and how your
requirements can be met, you can
contact sales
to request help from a Google compliance specialist. Or, you can contact your
Google Cloud account manager to request a compliance workshop.
For more information about tools and resources that you can use to manage
security and compliance for Google Cloud workloads, see
Assuring Compliance in the Cloud
.
Automate implementation of compliance requirements
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
To help you stay in compliance with changing regulations, determine whether you
can automate how you implement compliance requirements. You can use both
compliance-focused capabilities that Google Cloud provides and blueprints
that use recommended configurations for a particular compliance regime.
Assured Workloads
builds on the controls within Google Cloud to help you meet your
compliance obligations. Assured Workloads lets you do the following:
Select your compliance regime. Then, the tool automatically sets the
baseline personnel access controls for the selected regime.
Set the location for your data by using organization policies so that
your data at rest and your resources remain only in that
region
.
Select the key-management option (such as the key rotation period) that
best meets your security and compliance requirements.
Select the access criteria for Google support personnel to meet certain
regulatory requirements such as FedRAMP Moderate. For example, you can
select whether Google support personnel have completed the appropriate
background checks.
Use Google-owned and Google-owned and Google-managed encryption key that are FIPS-140-2
compliant and support FedRAMP Moderate compliance. For an added layer of
control and for the separation of duties, you can use customer-managed
encryption keys (CMEK). For more information about keys, see
Encrypt data at rest and in transit
.
In addition to Assured Workloads, you can use Google Cloud
blueprints that are relevant to your compliance regime. You can modify these
blueprints to incorporate your security policies into your infrastructure
deployments.
To help you build an environment that supports your compliance requirements,
Google's blueprints and solution guides include recommended configurations and
provide Terraform modules. The following table lists blueprints that address
security and alignment with compliance requirements.

Monitor your compliance
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
Logging, monitoring, and auditing
Most regulations require that you monitor particular activities, which include
access-related activities. To help with your monitoring, you can use the
following:
Access Transparency
:
View near real-time logs when Google Cloud administrators access your
content.
Firewall Rules Logging
:
Record TCP and UDP connections inside a VPC network for any rules that you
create. These logs can be useful for auditing network access or for
providing early warning that the network is being used in an unapproved manner.
VPC Flow Logs
:
Record network traffic flows that are sent or received by VM instances.
Security Command Center Premium
:
Monitor for compliance with various standards.
OSSEC
(or another open source tool): Log the activity of individuals who have
administrator access to your environment.
Key Access Justifications
:
View the reasons for a key-access request.
Security Command Center notifications
:
Get alerts when noncompliance issues occur.
For example, get alerts when users disable two-step verification or when
service accounts are over-privileged.
You can also set up automatic remediation for specific notifications.
Recommendations to manage your data sovereignty
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Data sovereignty provides you with a mechanism to prevent Google from accessing
your data. You approve access only for provider behaviors that you agree are
necessary. For example, you can manage your data sovereignty in the following
ways:
Store and manage
encryption keys
outside the cloud.
Grant access to these keys based on detailed
access justifications
.
Protect data in use
by using Confidential Computing.
Manage your operational sovereignty
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Operational sovereignty provides you with assurances that Google personnel can't
compromise your workloads. For example, you can manage operational sovereignty
in the following ways:
Restrict the deployment
of new resources to specific provider regions.
Limit Google personnel access
based on predefined attributes such as their citizenship or geographic location.
Manage software sovereignty
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Software sovereignty provides you with assurances that you can control the
availability of your workloads and run them wherever you want. Also, you can
have this control without being dependent or locked in with a single cloud
provider. Software sovereignty includes the ability to survive events that
require you to quickly change where your workloads are deployed and what level
of outside connection is allowed.
For example, to help you manage your software sovereignty, Google Cloud
supports
hybrid and multicloud deployments
.
In addition,
GKE Enterprise
lets you manage and deploy your applications in both cloud environments and
on-premises environments. If you choose on-premises deployments for data
sovereignty reasons,
Google Distributed Cloud
is a combination of hardware and software that brings Google Cloud into
your data center.
Recommendations to address privacy requirements
Google Cloud includes the following controls that promote privacy:
Default encryption of all data when it's at rest, when it's in transit,
and while it's being processed.
Safeguards against insider access.
Support for numerous privacy regulations.
The following recommendations address additional controls that you can
implement. For more information, see
Privacy Resource Center
.
Control data residency
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Data residency describes where your data is stored at rest. Data residency
requirements vary based on system design objectives, industry regulatory
concerns, national law, tax implications, and even culture.
Controlling data residency starts with the following:
Understand your data type and its location.
Determine what risks exist for your data and which laws and regulations
apply.
Control where your data is stored or where it goes.
To help you comply with data residency requirements, Google Cloud lets
you control where your data is stored, how it's accessed, and how it's
processed. You can use
resource location policies
to restrict where resources are created and to limit where data is replicated
between regions. You can use the location property of a resource to identify
where the service is deployed and who maintains it. For more information, see
Resource locations supported services
.
Classify your confidential data
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Data security.
You must define what data is confidential, and then ensure that the confidential
data is properly protected. Confidential data can include credit card numbers,
addresses, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII).
Using
Sensitive Data Protection
,
you can set up appropriate classifications. You can then tag and tokenize your
data before you store it in Google Cloud. Additionally,
Dataplex offers a
catalog
service that provides a platform for storing, managing, and accessing your
metadata. For more information and an example of data classification and
de-identification, see
De-identification and re-identification of PII using Sensitive Data Protection
.
Lock down access to sensitive data
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Data security
Identity and access management
Place sensitive data in its own service perimeter by using
VPC Service Controls
.
VPC Service Controls improves your ability to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
copying or transferring of data (data exfiltration) from Google-managed
services. With VPC Service Controls, you configure security perimeters around the
resources of your Google-managed services to control the movement of data across
the perimeter. Set
Google Identity and Access Management (IAM)
access controls for that data. Configure
multifactor authentication (MFA)
for all users who require access to sensitive data.
Shared responsibilities and shared fate on Google Cloud
This document describes the differences between the shared responsibility model
and shared fate in Google Cloud. It discusses the challenges and nuances
of the shared responsibility model. This document describes what shared fate is
and how we partner with our customers to address cloud security challenges.
Understanding the shared responsibility model is important when determining how
to best protect your data and workloads on Google Cloud. The shared
responsibility model describes the tasks that you have when it comes to security
in the cloud and how these tasks are different for cloud providers.
Understanding shared responsibility, however, can be challenging. The model
requires an in-depth understanding of each service you utilize, the
configuration options that each service provides, and what Google Cloud
does to secure the service. Every service has a different configuration profile,
and it can be difficult to determine the best security configuration. Google believes that the shared responsibility model stops short
of helping cloud customers achieve better security outcomes. Instead of shared
responsibility, we believe in
shared fate
.
Shared fate includes us building and operating a trusted cloud platform for
your workloads. We provide best practice guidance and secured, attested
infrastructure code that you can use to deploy your workloads in a secure way.
We release solutions that combine various Google Cloud services to solve
complex security problems and we offer innovative insurance options to help you
measure and mitigate the risks that you must accept. Shared fate involves us
more closely interacting with you as you secure your resources on
Google Cloud.
Shared responsibility
You're the expert in knowing the security and regulatory requirements for your
business, and knowing the requirements for protecting your confidential data and
resources. When you run your workloads on Google Cloud, you must identify
the security controls that you need to configure in Google Cloud to help
protect your confidential data and each workload. To decide which security
controls to implement, you must consider the following factors:
Your regulatory compliance obligations
Your organization's security standards and risk management plan
Security requirements of your customers and your vendors
Defined by workloads
Traditionally, responsibilities are defined based on the type of workload that
you're running and the cloud services that you require. Cloud services include
the following categories:
Cloud service
Description
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
IaaS services include
Compute Engine
,
Cloud Storage
, and networking
services such as
Cloud VPN
,
Cloud Load Balancing
, and
Cloud DNS
.
IaaS provides compute, storage, and network services on demand with
pay-as-you-go pricing. You can use IaaS if you plan on migrating an
existing on-premises workload to the cloud using lift-and-shift, or
if you want to run your application on particular VMs, using specific
databases or network configurations.
In IaaS, the bulk of the security responsibilities are yours, and our
responsibilities are focused on the underlying infrastructure and
physical security.
Platform as a service (PaaS)
PaaS services include
App Engine
,
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
, and
BigQuery
.
PaaS provides the runtime environment that you can develop and run
your applications in. You can use PaaS if you're building an
application (such as a website), and want to focus on development
not on the underlying infrastructure.
In PaaS, we're responsible for more controls than in IaaS. Typically, this will vary by the services and features that you use. You share responsibility with us for
application-level controls and IAM management. You
remain responsible for your data security and client protection.
Software as a service (SaaS)
SaaS applications include
Google Workspace
,
Google Security Operations
, and
third-party SaaS applications that are available in
Google Cloud Marketplace
.
SaaS provides online applications that you can subscribe to or pay
for in some way. You can use SaaS applications when your enterprise
doesn't have the internal expertise or business requirement to build
the application themselves, but does require the ability to process
workloads.
In SaaS, we own the bulk of the security responsibilities. You remain
responsible for your access controls and the data that you choose to
store in the application.
Function as a service (FaaS) or serverless
FaaS provides the platform for developers to run small,
single-purpose code (called
functions
) that run in response
to particular events. You would use FaaS when you want particular
things to occur based on a particular event. For example, you might
create a function that runs whenever data is uploaded to
Cloud Storage so that it can be classified.
FaaS has a similar shared responsibility list as SaaS.
Cloud Run functions
is a FaaS
application.
The following diagram shows the cloud services and defines how responsibilities
are shared between the cloud provider and customer.
As the diagram shows, the cloud provider always remains responsible for the
underlying network and infrastructure, and customers always remain responsible
for their access policies and data.
Defined by industry and regulatory framework
Various industries have regulatory frameworks that define the security controls
that must be in place. When you move your workloads to the cloud, you must
understand the following:
Which security controls are your responsibility
Which security controls are available as part of the cloud offering
Which default security controls are inherited
Inherited security controls (such as our
default encryption
and
infrastructure controls
)
are controls that you can provide as part of your evidence of your security
posture to auditors and regulators. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS) defines regulations for payment processors. When you
move your business to the cloud, these regulations are shared between you and
your CSP. To understand how PCI DSS responsibilities are shared between you and
Google Cloud, see
Google Cloud: PCI DSS Shared Responsibility Matrix
.
As another example, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) has set standards for handling electronic personal
health information (PHI). These responsibilities are also shared between the CSP
and you. For more information on how Google Cloud meets our
responsibilities under HIPAA, see
HIPAA - Compliance
.
Other industries (for example, finance or manufacturing) also have regulations
that define how data can be gathered, processed, and stored. For more
information about shared responsibility related to these, and how
Google Cloud meets our responsibilities, see
Compliance resource center
.
Defined by location
Depending on your business scenario, you might need to consider your
responsibilities based on the location of your business offices, your customers,
and your data. Different countries and regions have created regulations that
inform how you can process and store your customer's data. For example, if your
business has customers who reside in the European Union, your business might
need to abide by the requirements that are described in the
General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), and you might be obligated to keep your customer data in the EU itself.
In this circumstance, you are responsible for ensuring that the data that you
collect remains in the
Google Cloud regions in the EU
.
For more information about how we meet our GDPR obligations, see
GDPR and Google Cloud
.
For information about the requirements related to your region, see
Compliance offerings
.
If your scenario is particularly complicated, we recommend speaking with our
sales team
or one of our
partners
to help you evaluate your security responsibilities.
Challenges for shared responsibility
Though shared responsibility helps define the security roles that you or the
cloud provider has, relying on shared responsibility can still create
challenges. Consider the following scenarios:
Most cloud security breaches are the direct result of misconfiguration
(listed as
number 3 in the Cloud Security Alliance's Pandemic 11 Report
)
and this trend is expected to increase. Cloud products are constantly
changing, and new ones are constantly being launched. Keeping up with
constant change can seem overwhelming. Customers need cloud providers to
provide them with opinionated best practices to help keep up with the
change, starting with best practices by default and having a baseline
secure configuration.
Though dividing items by cloud services is helpful, many enterprises
have workloads that require multiple cloud services types. In this
circumstance, you must consider how various security controls for these
services interact, including whether they overlap between and across
services.  For example, you might have an on-premises application that
you're migrating to Compute Engine, use Google Workspace
for corporate email, and also run BigQuery to analyze data
to improve your products.
Your business and markets are constantly changing; as regulations
change, as you enter new markets, or as you acquire other companies. Your
new markets might have different requirements, and your new acquisition
might host their workloads on another cloud. To manage the constant
changes, you must constantly re-assess your risk profile and be able to
implement new controls quickly.
How and where to manage your data encryption keys is an important
decision that ties with your responsibilities to protect your data. The
option that you choose depends on your regulatory requirements, whether
you're running a hybrid cloud environment or still have an on-premises
environment, and the sensitivity of the data that you're processing and
storing.
Incident management is an important, and often overlooked, area where
your responsibilities and the cloud provider responsibilities aren't easily
defined. Many incidents require close collaboration and support from the
cloud provider to help investigate and mitigate them. Other incidents can
result from poorly configured cloud resources or stolen credentials, and
ensuring that you meet the best practices for securing your resources and
accounts can be quite challenging.
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) and new vulnerabilities can impact
your workloads in ways that you might not consider when you start your
cloud transformation. Ensuring that you remain up-to-date on the changing
landscape, and who is responsible for threat mitigation is difficult,
particularly if your business doesn't have a large security team.
Shared fate
We developed shared fate in Google Cloud to start addressing the
challenges that the shared responsibility model doesn't address. Shared fate
focuses on how all parties can better interact to continuously improve security.
Shared fate builds on the shared responsibility model because it views the
relationship between cloud provider and customer as an ongoing partnership to
improve security.
Shared fate is about us taking responsibility for making Google Cloud
more secure. Shared fate includes helping you get started with a secured
landing zone
and being clear, opinionated, and transparent about recommended security
controls, settings, and associated best practices. It includes helping you
better quantify and manage your risk with cyber-insurance, using our Risk
Protection Program. Using shared fate, we want to evolve from the standard
shared responsibility framework to a better model that helps you secure your
business and build trust in Google Cloud.
The following sections describe various components of shared fate.
Help getting started
A key component of shared fate is the resources that we provide to help you get
started, in a secure configuration in Google Cloud. Starting with a secure
configuration helps reduce the issue of misconfigurations which is the root
cause of most security breaches.
Our resources include the following:
Enterprise foundations blueprint
that discuss top security concerns and our top recommendations.
Secure blueprints
that let you deploy and maintain secure solutions using
infrastructure as
code
(IaC). Blueprints have our security recommendations enabled by
default. Many blueprints are created by Google security teams and managed
as products. This support means that they're updated regularly, go through
a rigorous testing process, and receive attestations from third-party
testing groups. Blueprints include the
enterprise foundations blueprint
and the
secured data warehouse blueprint
.
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework best practices that address the top
recommendations for building security into your designs. The
Well-Architected Framework includes a
security section
and a
community zone
that you can use to connect with experts and peers.
Landing zone navigation guides
that step you through the top decisions that you need to make to build a
secure foundation for your workloads, including resource hierarchy,
identity onboarding, security and key management, and network structure.
Risk Protection Program
Shared fate also includes the
Risk Protection Program
(currently in preview), which helps you use the power of Google Cloud as a
platform to manage risk, rather than just seeing cloud workloads as another
source of risk that you need to manage. The Risk Protection Program is a
collaboration between Google Cloud and two leading cyber insurance
companies, Munich Re and Allianz Global & Corporate Speciality.
The Risk Protection Program includes
Cyber Insurance Hub
,
which provides data-driven insights that you can use to better understand your
cloud security posture. If you're looking for cyber insurance coverage, you can
share these insights from Cyber Insurance Hub directly with our insurance
partners to obtain a quote.  For more information, see
Google Cloud Risk Protection Program now in Preview
.
Help with deployment and governance
Shared fate also helps with your continued governance of your environment. For
example, we focus efforts on products such as the following:
Assured Workloads
,
which helps you meet your compliance obligations.
Security Command Center
Premium, which uses threat intelligence, threat detection, web scanning,
and other advanced methods to monitor and detect threats. It also provides
a way to resolve many of these threats quickly and automatically.
Organization policies
and
resource settings
that let you configure policies throughout your hierarchy of folders and
projects.
Policy Intelligence tools
that provide you with insights on access to accounts and resources.
Confidential Computing
,
which allows you to encrypt data in use.
Sovereign Controls by Partners
, which is available in certain countries
and helps enforce data residency requirements.
Putting shared responsibility and shared fate into practice
As part of your planning process, consider the following actions to help you
understand and implement appropriate security controls:
Create a list of the type of workloads that you will host in
Google Cloud, and whether they require IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services.
You can use the
shared responsibility diagram
as a checklist to ensure that you know the security controls that you need
to consider.
Create a list of regulatory requirements that you must comply with, and
access resources in the
Compliance resource center
that relate to those requirements.
Review the list of available blueprints and architectures in the
Architecture Center
for the security controls that you require for your particular workloads.
The blueprints provide a list of recommended controls and the IaC code that
you require to deploy that architecture.
Use the
landing zone documentation
and the recommendations in the
enterprise foundations guide
to design a resource hierarchy and network architecture that meets your
requirements. You can use the opinionated workload blueprints, like the
secured data warehouse, to accelerate your development process.
After you deploy your workloads, verify that you're meeting your
security responsibilities using services such as the
Cyber Insurance Hub, Assured Workloads,
Policy Intelligence tools, and Security Command Center Premium.

Shared responsibilities and shared fate on Google Cloud
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the differences between the shared responsibility model
and shared fate in Google Cloud. It discusses the challenges and nuances
of the shared responsibility model. This document describes what shared fate is
and how we partner with our customers to address cloud security challenges.
Understanding the shared responsibility model is important when determining how
to best protect your data and workloads on Google Cloud. The shared
responsibility model describes the tasks that you have when it comes to security
in the cloud and how these tasks are different for cloud providers.
Understanding shared responsibility, however, can be challenging. The model
requires an in-depth understanding of each service you utilize, the
configuration options that each service provides, and what Google Cloud
does to secure the service. Every service has a different configuration profile,
and it can be difficult to determine the best security configuration. Google believes that the shared responsibility model stops short
of helping cloud customers achieve better security outcomes. Instead of shared
responsibility, we believe in
shared fate
.
Shared fate includes us building and operating a trusted cloud platform for
your workloads. We provide best practice guidance and secured, attested
infrastructure code that you can use to deploy your workloads in a secure way.
We release solutions that combine various Google Cloud services to solve
complex security problems and we offer innovative insurance options to help you
measure and mitigate the risks that you must accept. Shared fate involves us
more closely interacting with you as you secure your resources on
Google Cloud.
Shared responsibility
You're the expert in knowing the security and regulatory requirements for your
business, and knowing the requirements for protecting your confidential data and
resources. When you run your workloads on Google Cloud, you must identify
the security controls that you need to configure in Google Cloud to help
protect your confidential data and each workload. To decide which security
controls to implement, you must consider the following factors:
Your regulatory compliance obligations
Your organization's security standards and risk management plan
Security requirements of your customers and your vendors
Defined by workloads
Traditionally, responsibilities are defined based on the type of workload that
you're running and the cloud services that you require. Cloud services include
the following categories:
Cloud service
Description
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
IaaS services include
Compute Engine
,
Cloud Storage
, and networking
services such as
Cloud VPN
,
Cloud Load Balancing
, and
Cloud DNS
.
IaaS provides compute, storage, and network services on demand with
pay-as-you-go pricing. You can use IaaS if you plan on migrating an
existing on-premises workload to the cloud using lift-and-shift, or
if you want to run your application on particular VMs, using specific
databases or network configurations.
In IaaS, the bulk of the security responsibilities are yours, and our
responsibilities are focused on the underlying infrastructure and
physical security.
Platform as a service (PaaS)
PaaS services include
App Engine
,
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
, and
BigQuery
.
PaaS provides the runtime environment that you can develop and run
your applications in. You can use PaaS if you're building an
application (such as a website), and want to focus on development
not on the underlying infrastructure.
In PaaS, we're responsible for more controls than in IaaS. Typically, this will vary by the services and features that you use. You share responsibility with us for
application-level controls and IAM management. You
remain responsible for your data security and client protection.
Software as a service (SaaS)
SaaS applications include
Google Workspace
,
Google Security Operations
, and
third-party SaaS applications that are available in
Google Cloud Marketplace
.
SaaS provides online applications that you can subscribe to or pay
for in some way. You can use SaaS applications when your enterprise
doesn't have the internal expertise or business requirement to build
the application themselves, but does require the ability to process
workloads.
In SaaS, we own the bulk of the security responsibilities. You remain
responsible for your access controls and the data that you choose to
store in the application.
Function as a service (FaaS) or serverless
FaaS provides the platform for developers to run small,
single-purpose code (called
functions
) that run in response
to particular events. You would use FaaS when you want particular
things to occur based on a particular event. For example, you might
create a function that runs whenever data is uploaded to
Cloud Storage so that it can be classified.
FaaS has a similar shared responsibility list as SaaS.
Cloud Run functions
is a FaaS
application.
The following diagram shows the cloud services and defines how responsibilities
are shared between the cloud provider and customer.
As the diagram shows, the cloud provider always remains responsible for the
underlying network and infrastructure, and customers always remain responsible
for their access policies and data.
Defined by industry and regulatory framework
Various industries have regulatory frameworks that define the security controls
that must be in place. When you move your workloads to the cloud, you must
understand the following:
Which security controls are your responsibility
Which security controls are available as part of the cloud offering
Which default security controls are inherited
Inherited security controls (such as our
default encryption
and
infrastructure controls
)
are controls that you can provide as part of your evidence of your security
posture to auditors and regulators. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS) defines regulations for payment processors. When you
move your business to the cloud, these regulations are shared between you and
your CSP. To understand how PCI DSS responsibilities are shared between you and
Google Cloud, see
Google Cloud: PCI DSS Shared Responsibility Matrix
.
As another example, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) has set standards for handling electronic personal
health information (PHI). These responsibilities are also shared between the CSP
and you. For more information on how Google Cloud meets our
responsibilities under HIPAA, see
HIPAA - Compliance
.
Other industries (for example, finance or manufacturing) also have regulations
that define how data can be gathered, processed, and stored. For more
information about shared responsibility related to these, and how
Google Cloud meets our responsibilities, see
Compliance resource center
.
Defined by location
Depending on your business scenario, you might need to consider your
responsibilities based on the location of your business offices, your customers,
and your data. Different countries and regions have created regulations that
inform how you can process and store your customer's data. For example, if your
business has customers who reside in the European Union, your business might
need to abide by the requirements that are described in the
General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), and you might be obligated to keep your customer data in the EU itself.
In this circumstance, you are responsible for ensuring that the data that you
collect remains in the
Google Cloud regions in the EU
.
For more information about how we meet our GDPR obligations, see
GDPR and Google Cloud
.
For information about the requirements related to your region, see
Compliance offerings
.
If your scenario is particularly complicated, we recommend speaking with our
sales team
or one of our
partners
to help you evaluate your security responsibilities.
Challenges for shared responsibility
Though shared responsibility helps define the security roles that you or the
cloud provider has, relying on shared responsibility can still create
challenges. Consider the following scenarios:
Most cloud security breaches are the direct result of misconfiguration
(listed as
number 3 in the Cloud Security Alliance's Pandemic 11 Report
)
and this trend is expected to increase. Cloud products are constantly
changing, and new ones are constantly being launched. Keeping up with
constant change can seem overwhelming. Customers need cloud providers to
provide them with opinionated best practices to help keep up with the
change, starting with best practices by default and having a baseline
secure configuration.
Though dividing items by cloud services is helpful, many enterprises
have workloads that require multiple cloud services types. In this
circumstance, you must consider how various security controls for these
services interact, including whether they overlap between and across
services.  For example, you might have an on-premises application that
you're migrating to Compute Engine, use Google Workspace
for corporate email, and also run BigQuery to analyze data
to improve your products.
Your business and markets are constantly changing; as regulations
change, as you enter new markets, or as you acquire other companies. Your
new markets might have different requirements, and your new acquisition
might host their workloads on another cloud. To manage the constant
changes, you must constantly re-assess your risk profile and be able to
implement new controls quickly.
How and where to manage your data encryption keys is an important
decision that ties with your responsibilities to protect your data. The
option that you choose depends on your regulatory requirements, whether
you're running a hybrid cloud environment or still have an on-premises
environment, and the sensitivity of the data that you're processing and
storing.
Incident management is an important, and often overlooked, area where
your responsibilities and the cloud provider responsibilities aren't easily
defined. Many incidents require close collaboration and support from the
cloud provider to help investigate and mitigate them. Other incidents can
result from poorly configured cloud resources or stolen credentials, and
ensuring that you meet the best practices for securing your resources and
accounts can be quite challenging.
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) and new vulnerabilities can impact
your workloads in ways that you might not consider when you start your
cloud transformation. Ensuring that you remain up-to-date on the changing
landscape, and who is responsible for threat mitigation is difficult,
particularly if your business doesn't have a large security team.
Shared fate
We developed shared fate in Google Cloud to start addressing the
challenges that the shared responsibility model doesn't address. Shared fate
focuses on how all parties can better interact to continuously improve security.
Shared fate builds on the shared responsibility model because it views the
relationship between cloud provider and customer as an ongoing partnership to
improve security.
Shared fate is about us taking responsibility for making Google Cloud
more secure. Shared fate includes helping you get started with a secured
landing zone
and being clear, opinionated, and transparent about recommended security
controls, settings, and associated best practices. It includes helping you
better quantify and manage your risk with cyber-insurance, using our Risk
Protection Program. Using shared fate, we want to evolve from the standard
shared responsibility framework to a better model that helps you secure your
business and build trust in Google Cloud.
The following sections describe various components of shared fate.
Help getting started
A key component of shared fate is the resources that we provide to help you get
started, in a secure configuration in Google Cloud. Starting with a secure
configuration helps reduce the issue of misconfigurations which is the root
cause of most security breaches.
Our resources include the following:
Enterprise foundations blueprint
that discuss top security concerns and our top recommendations.
Secure blueprints
that let you deploy and maintain secure solutions using
infrastructure as
code
(IaC). Blueprints have our security recommendations enabled by
default. Many blueprints are created by Google security teams and managed
as products. This support means that they're updated regularly, go through
a rigorous testing process, and receive attestations from third-party
testing groups. Blueprints include the
enterprise foundations blueprint
and the
secured data warehouse blueprint
.
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework best practices that address the top
recommendations for building security into your designs. The
Well-Architected Framework includes a
security section
and a
community zone
that you can use to connect with experts and peers.
Landing zone navigation guides
that step you through the top decisions that you need to make to build a
secure foundation for your workloads, including resource hierarchy,
identity onboarding, security and key management, and network structure.
Risk Protection Program
Shared fate also includes the
Risk Protection Program
(currently in preview), which helps you use the power of Google Cloud as a
platform to manage risk, rather than just seeing cloud workloads as another
source of risk that you need to manage. The Risk Protection Program is a
collaboration between Google Cloud and two leading cyber insurance
companies, Munich Re and Allianz Global & Corporate Speciality.
The Risk Protection Program includes
Cyber Insurance Hub
,
which provides data-driven insights that you can use to better understand your
cloud security posture. If you're looking for cyber insurance coverage, you can
share these insights from Cyber Insurance Hub directly with our insurance
partners to obtain a quote.  For more information, see
Google Cloud Risk Protection Program now in Preview
.
Help with deployment and governance
Shared fate also helps with your continued governance of your environment. For
example, we focus efforts on products such as the following:
Assured Workloads
,
which helps you meet your compliance obligations.
Security Command Center
Premium, which uses threat intelligence, threat detection, web scanning,
and other advanced methods to monitor and detect threats. It also provides
a way to resolve many of these threats quickly and automatically.
Organization policies
and
resource settings
that let you configure policies throughout your hierarchy of folders and
projects.
Policy Intelligence tools
that provide you with insights on access to accounts and resources.
Confidential Computing
,
which allows you to encrypt data in use.
Sovereign Controls by Partners
, which is available in certain countries
and helps enforce data residency requirements.
Putting shared responsibility and shared fate into practice
As part of your planning process, consider the following actions to help you
understand and implement appropriate security controls:
Create a list of the type of workloads that you will host in
Google Cloud, and whether they require IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services.
You can use the
shared responsibility diagram
as a checklist to ensure that you know the security controls that you need
to consider.
Create a list of regulatory requirements that you must comply with, and
access resources in the
Compliance resource center
that relate to those requirements.
Review the list of available blueprints and architectures in the
Architecture Center
for the security controls that you require for your particular workloads.
The blueprints provide a list of recommended controls and the IaC code that
you require to deploy that architecture.
Use the
landing zone documentation
and the recommendations in the
enterprise foundations guide
to design a resource hierarchy and network architecture that meets your
requirements. You can use the opinionated workload blueprints, like the
secured data warehouse, to accelerate your development process.
After you deploy your workloads, verify that you're meeting your
security responsibilities using services such as the
Cyber Insurance Hub, Assured Workloads,
Policy Intelligence tools, and Security Command Center Premium.

Use AI for security
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to use AI to help you improve the security of your
cloud workloads.
Because of the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks, it's
important to take advantage of AI's potential to help improve security. AI can
help to reduce the number of threats, reduce the manual effort required by security
professionals, and help compensate for the scarcity of experts in the cyber-security
domain.
Principle overview
Use AI capabilities to improve your existing security systems and processes.
You can use
Gemini in Security
as well as the intrinsic AI capabilities that are built into Google Cloud services.
These AI capabilities can transform security by providing assistance across
every stage of the security lifecycle. For example, you can use AI to do the
following:
Analyze and explain potentially malicious code without reverse engineering.
Reduce repetitive work for cyber-security practitioners.
Use natural language to generate queries and interact with security
event data.
Surface contextual information.
Offer recommendations for quick responses.
Aid in the remediation of events.
Summarize high-priority alerts for misconfigurations and
vulnerabilities, highlight potential impacts, and recommend mitigations.
Levels of security autonomy
AI and automation can help you achieve better security outcomes when you're
dealing with ever-evolving cyber-security threats. By using AI for security, you
can achieve greater levels of autonomy to detect and prevent threats and improve
your overall security posture. Google defines four
levels of autonomy
when you use AI for security, and they outline the increasing role of AI in
assisting and eventually leading security tasks:
Manual
: Humans run all of the security tasks (prevent, detect,
prioritize, and respond) across the entire security lifecycle.
Assisted
: AI tools, like Gemini, boost human
productivity by summarizing information, generating insights, and making
recommendations.
Semi-autonomous
: AI takes primary responsibility for many security
tasks and delegates to humans only when required.
Autonomous
: AI acts as a trusted assistant that drives the security
lifecycle based on your organization's goals and preferences, with minimal
human intervention.
Recommendations
The following sections describe the recommendations for using AI for security.
The sections also indicate how the recommendations align with Google's Secure AI
Framework (SAIF)
core elements
and how they're relevant to the
levels of security autonomy
.
Enhance threat detection and response with AI
Simplify security for experts and non-experts
Automate time-consuming security tasks with AI
Incorporate AI into risk management and governance processes
Implement secure development practices for AI systems
Note:

Google Cloud's Product Vision for AI-Powered Security
.
Enhance threat detection and response with AI
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Security operations (SecOps)
Logging, auditing, and monitoring
AI can analyze large volumes of security data, offer insights into threat actor
behavior, and automate the analysis of potentially malicious code. This
recommendation is aligned with the following SAIF elements:
Extend detection and response to bring AI into your organization's
threat universe.
Automate defenses to keep pace with existing and new threats.
Depending on your implementation, this recommendation can be relevant to the
following levels of autonomy:
Assisted
: AI helps with threat analysis and detection.
Semi-autonomous
: AI takes on more responsibility for the security task.
Google Threat Intelligence
,
which uses AI to analyze threat actor behavior and malicious code, can help you
implement this recommendation.
Simplify security for experts and non-experts
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Security operations (SecOps)
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
AI-powered tools can summarize alerts and recommend mitigations, and these
capabilities can make security more accessible to a wider range of personnel.
This recommendation is aligned with the following SAIF elements:
Automate defenses to keep pace with existing and new threats.
Harmonize platform-level controls to ensure consistent security across
the organization.
Depending on your implementation, this recommendation can be relevant to the
following levels of autonomy:
Assisted
: AI helps you to improve the accessibility of security
information.
Semi-autonomous
: AI helps to make security practices more effective
for all users.
Gemini in
Security Command Center
can provide summaries of alerts for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
Automate time-consuming security tasks with AI
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Infrastructure security
Security operations (SecOps)
Application security
AI can automate tasks such as analyzing malware, generating security rules, and
identifying misconfigurations. These capabilities can help to reduce the
workload on security teams and accelerate response times. This recommendation is
aligned with the SAIF element about automating defenses to keep pace with
existing and new threats.
Depending on your implementation, this recommendation can be relevant to the
following levels of autonomy:
Assisted
: AI helps you to automate tasks.
Semi-autonomous
: AI takes primary responsibility for security tasks,
and only requests human assistance when needed.
Gemini in
Google SecOps
can help to automate high-toil tasks by assisting analysts, retrieving relevant
context, and making recommendations for next steps.
Incorporate AI into risk management and governance processes
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
You can use AI to build a model inventory and risk profiles. You can also use AI
to implement policies for data privacy, cyber risk, and third-party risk. This
recommendation is aligned with the SAIF element about contextualizing AI system
risks in surrounding business processes.
Depending on your implementation, this recommendation can be relevant to the
semi-autonomous level of autonomy. At this level, AI can orchestrate security
agents that run processes to achieve your custom security goals.
Implement secure development practices for AI systems
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Application security
AI and ML security
You can use AI for secure coding, cleaning training data, and validating tools
and artifacts. This recommendation is aligned with the SAIF element about
expanding strong security foundations to the AI ecosystem.
This recommendation can be relevant to all levels of security autonomy, because
a secure AI system needs to be in place before AI can be used effectively for
security. The recommendation is most relevant to the assisted level, where
security practices are augmented by AI.
To implement this recommendation, follow the
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)
guidelines for AI artifacts and use validated container images.

Use AI securely and responsibly
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This principle in the security pillar of the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides recommendations to help you secure your AI systems. These
recommendations are aligned with Google's
Secure AI Framework (SAIF)
,
which provides a practical approach to address the security and risk concerns of
AI systems. SAIF is a conceptual framework that aims to provide industry-wide
standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.
Principle overview
To help ensure that your AI systems meet your security, privacy, and compliance
requirements, you must adopt a holistic strategy that starts with the initial
design and extends to deployment and operations. You can implement this holistic
strategy by applying the
six core elements of SAIF
.
Google uses AI to enhance security measures, such as identifying threats,
automating security tasks, and improving detection capabilities, while keeping
humans in the loop for critical decisions.
Google emphasizes a collaborative approach to advancing AI security. This
approach involves partnering with customers, industries, and governments to
enhance the SAIF guidelines and offer practical, actionable resources.
The recommendations to implement this principle are grouped within the
following sections:
Recommendations to use AI securely
Recommendations for AI governance
Recommendations to use AI securely
To use AI securely, you need both foundational security controls and
AI-specific security controls. This section provides an overview of
recommendations to ensure that your AI and ML deployments meet the security,
privacy, and compliance requirements of your organization.


For an overview of architectual principles and recommendations that are specific to AI
and ML workloads in Google Cloud, see the
AI and ML perspective
in the Well-Architected Framework.
Define clear goals and requirements for AI usage
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance
AI and ML security
This recommendation aligns with the SAIF element about contextualizing AI
system risks in the surrounding business processes. When you design and evolve
AI systems, it's important to understand your specific business goals, risks, and
compliance requirements.
Keep data secure and prevent loss or mishandling
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Infrastructure security
Identity and access management
Data security
Application security
AI and ML security
This recommendation aligns with the following SAIF elements:
Expand strong security foundations to the AI ecosystem. This element
includes data collection, storage, access control, and protection against
data poisoning.
Contextualize AI system risks. Emphasize data security to support
business objectives and compliance.
Keep AI pipelines secure and robust against tampering
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Infrastructure security
Identity and access management
Data security
Application security
AI and ML security
This recommendation aligns with the following SAIF elements:
Expand strong security foundations to the AI ecosystem. As a key
element of establishing a secure AI system, secure your code and model
artifacts.
Adapt controls for faster feedback loops. Because it's important for
mitigation and incident response, track your assets and pipeline runs.
Deploy apps on secure systems using secure tools and artifacts
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Infrastructure security
Identity and access management
Data security
Application security
AI and ML security
Using secure systems and validated tools and artifacts in AI-based applications
aligns with the SAIF element about expanding strong security foundations to the
AI ecosystem and supply chain. This recommendation can be addressed through the
following steps:
Implement a secure environment for ML training and deployment
Use validated container images
Apply
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)
guidelines
Protect and monitor inputs
This recommendation is relevant to the following
focus areas
:
Logging, auditing, and monitoring
Security operations
AI and ML security
This recommendation aligns with the SAIF element about extending detection and
response to bring AI into an organization's threat universe. To prevent issues,
it's critical to manage prompts for generative AI systems, monitor inputs, and
control user access.
Recommendations for AI governance
All of the recommendations in this section are relevant to the following
focus area
:
Cloud governance, risk, and compliance.
Google Cloud offers a robust set of tools and services that you can use
to build responsible and ethical AI systems. We also offer a framework of
policies, procedures, and ethical considerations that can guide the development,
deployment, and use of AI systems.
As reflected in our recommendations, Google's approach for AI governance is
guided by the following principles:
Fairness
Transparency
Accountability
Privacy
Security
Use fairness indicators
Vertex AI
can detect bias during the data collection or post-training evaluation process.
Vertex AI provides
model evaluation metrics
like
data bias
and
model bias
to help you evaluate your model for bias.
These metrics are related to fairness across different categories like race,
gender, and class. However, interpreting statistical deviations isn't a
straightforward exercise, because differences across categories might not be a
result of bias or a signal of harm.
Use Vertex Explainable AI
To understand how the AI models make decisions, use Vertex Explainable AI. This
feature helps you to identify potential biases that might be hidden in the
model's logic.
This explainability feature is integrated with
BigQuery ML
and
Vertex AI
,
which provide feature-based explanations. You can either perform explainability
in BigQuery ML or
register your model
in Vertex AI and perform explainability in
Vertex AI.
Track data lineage
Track the origin and transformation of data that's used in your AI systems.
This tracking helps you understand the data's journey and identify potential
sources of bias or error.
Data lineage
is a Dataplex feature that lets you track how data moves through your
systems: where it comes from, where it's passed to, and what transformations are
applied to it.
Establish accountability
Establish clear responsibility for the development, deployment, and outcomes of
your AI systems.
Use
Cloud Logging
to log key events and decisions made by your AI systems. The logs provide an
audit trail to help you understand how the system is performing and identify
areas for improvement.
Use
Error Reporting
to systematically analyze errors made by the AI systems. This analysis can
reveal patterns that point to underlying biases or areas where the model needs
further refinement.
Implement differential privacy
During model training,
add noise
to the data in order to make it difficult to identify individual data points but
still enable the model to learn effectively. With
SQL in BigQuery
,
you can transform the results of a query with differentially private
aggregations
.
