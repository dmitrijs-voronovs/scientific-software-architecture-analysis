So beware with the aligner you use, unless you've cleaned; // up the reads in some way (left aligning the cigars or just doing assembly).; //; // It is ok to send reads that only partially overlap the interval; the; // AlleleCounter will only add counts from the part that overlap the interval.; //; // This code assumes that the reference genome and the reads have only upper; // case bases. By construction our GenomeReference will not have lower case; // bases. Lower case bases are allowed in read sequences (see; // https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf),; // so it may be worth upper casing the read sequence at some point to make this; // code more robust.; //; // AlleleCounter performs some specialized logic to deal with non-canonical; // bases that might occur in the reference and/or the reads. By canonical we; // mean bases that are one of {A,C,G,T}. The basic constraint is that we will; // not add Allele's that contain non-canonical bases. So if we have a read that; // has (e.g.) an N, we will not produce Allele objects that contain the N. So; // if it doesn't match the reference at a site, it will be skipped as a; // SUBSTITUTION allele, and if it were part of an insertion, that entire; // insertion will be skipped. We do support AlleleCount objects that have a N; // base as its reference base, and those bases get alleles just as a normal base; // would. Downstream processing should look at the reference base of the; // AlleleCounts produced by this code for non-canonical reference bases and; // handle if special handling is needed. Finally, if a read's deletion CIGAR; // spans across part of the reference genome that has an N, the corresponding; // DELETION allele will be dropped.

Your task is to evaluate whether the given text contains meaningful human-readable sentences or if it consists primarily of logs, code samples, or programmatic API description that should be filtered out.

For each input text, analyze it and determine:
1. Whether it should be eliminated (true/false)
2. The reason for elimination (if applicable)

Evaluation criteria:
- Eliminate text that consists primarily of:
  * Code snippets or samples (marked by syntax, keywords like ""if/else"", brackets, etc.)
  * Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
  * API documentation or specifications (parameter lists, return types)
  * Configuration files or build system output
  * Version control metadata or comments
  * Compiler/interpreter output or warnings
- Keep text that contains:
  * Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
  * Explanatory or descriptive content
  * Human-written prose discussing concepts or ideas

Content: osition, and a repeated field of Allele protos which contain the bases,; // type, and counts of the alleles.

",False,"The text contains meaningful sentences discussing concepts related to Allele protos and their processing, including examples and explanations. It does not primarily consist of code snippets or logs."
