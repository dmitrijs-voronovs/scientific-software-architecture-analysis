A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.; This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip; files and writes out uncompressed files. The utility would decode the; header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only; the raw deflate stream to decompress. This is different from the normal; behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and; trailer around the deflate stream. inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then; called by inflateBack() for input and output. inflateBack() calls those; routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the; uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error. The function's; parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func; typedefs. inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the; number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf. If; there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that; case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error. inflateBack() will call; out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1]. out(); should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure. If out() returns; non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error. Neither in() nor out(); are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to; inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.; The length written by out() will be at most the window size. Any non-zero; amount of input may be provided by in(). For convenience, inflateBack() can be provid

The deflate block is byte aligned by; * appending an empty stored block.; *; * - Full flush: whereby isal_deflate() finishes and aligns the deflate block as; * in sync flush but also ensures that subsequent block's history does not; * look back beyond this point and new blocks are fully independent.; *; * Igzip also supports compression levels from ISAL_DEF_MIN_LEVEL to; * ISAL_DEF_MAX_LEVEL.; *; * Igzip contains some behavior configurable at compile time.

Igzip supports the; * following flush features:; *; * - No Flush: The default method where no special flush is performed.; *; * - Sync flush: whereby isal_deflate() finishes the current deflate block at; * the end of each input buffer. The deflate block is byte aligned by; * appending an empty stored block.; *; * - Full flush: whereby isal_deflate() finishes and aligns the deflate block as; * in sync flush but also ensures that subsequent block's history does not; * look back beyond this point and new blocks are fully independent.; *; * Igzip also supports compression levels from ISAL_DEF_MIN_LEVEL to; * ISAL_DEF_MAX_LEVEL.; *; * Igzip contains some behavior configurable at compile time. These; * configurable options are:; *; * - IGZIP_HIST_SIZE - Defines the window size. The default value is 32K (note K; * represents 1024), but 8K is also supported.

The mode parameter is as; in fopen (""rb"" or ""wb"") but can also include a compression level (""wb9"") or; a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in ""wb6f"", 'h' for Huffman-only; compression as in ""wb1h"", 'R' for run-length encoding as in ""wb1R"", or 'F'; for fixed code compression as in ""wb9F"". (See the description of; deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.) 'T' will; request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using; the gzip format. ""a"" can be used instead of ""w"" to request that the gzip stream that will; be written be appended to the file. ""+"" will result in an error, since; reading and writing to the same gzip file is not supported. The addition of; ""x"" when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file; already exists. On systems that support it, the addition of ""e"" when; reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an execve() call. These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip; streams in a file. The append function of gzopen() can be used to create; such a file. (Also see gzflush() for another way to do this.) When; appending, gzopen does not test whether the file begins with a gzip stream,; nor does it look for the end of the gzip streams to begin appending. gzopen; will simply append a gzip stream to the existing file. gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this; case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression. When; reading, this will be detected automatically by looking for the magic two-; byte gzip header. gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened, if there was; insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was; specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not provided, or '+' was provided).; errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the; file could not be opened.; */
