I'm trying to run my own samples following along with the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md).

I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script?

Content: Hello,. We noticed that adjacent variants of the same haplotype (i.e. MNVs) are being called as separate variants in the DeepVariant and DeepTrio outputs with VCF and gVCF files.

The Supplementary information from the Nature paper mentions something about ""80 hours"" but does not specify which kind of hardware was used?. Do you have any numbers on how much the neural network improves the accuracy as compared to the raw (over-sensitive) variant calls output after the haplotype-aware realignment step?

",False,"The text contains a series of package download lines which appear to be part of an APT update log. These logs are not primarily code, logs, or API documentation, but rather the process of updating software packages. However, these may not constitute as 'meaningful human-readable sentences.' The content is more technical and related to package management, which could be considered somewhat programmatic in nature. Given the evaluation criteria, this text might lean towards elimination because it's more about system processes than human-readable prose. However, since it doesn't contain code snippets or logs with detailed error messages, it may not strictly fall into the 'logs' category but rather as technical output."

1. Whether it should be eliminated (true/false)
2. The reason for elimination (if applicable)

Evaluation criteria:
- Eliminate text that consists primarily of:
  * Code snippets or samples (marked by syntax, keywords like ""if/else"", brackets, etc.)
  * Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
  * API documentation or specifications (parameter lists, return types)
  * Configuration files or build system output
  * Version control metadata or comments
  * Compiler/interpreter output or warnings
- Keep text that contains:
  * Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
  * Explanatory or descriptive content
  * Human-written prose discussing concepts or ideas

Deployability,"h the [advanced training case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md). I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script. I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. ; First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. . Thank you very much for your time, and if these questions are answered clearly in a doc already, then I apologize and would appreciate being directed there. . Best, ; Haley .

I've reached the stage where I need to locally shuffle the training examples using the shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py script. I downloaded the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) and was initially getting an error that apache beam was not being recognized, and realized that beam did not install because its latest version (2.54) was incompatible with the current version of numpy (1.26) that was being imported. I uninstalled that new version of numpy in tensorflow and installed an older version that would be compatible (1.24.4), and then was able to install apache beam (2.54). However, now I'm getting even more errors (see below). Do you have any advice on which versions of everything I should make sure to have installed correctly before running the shuffle script? Any guidance is very much appreciated. . Not so much a question but I want to confirm my understanding of the pipeline from the tutorial, as again I am very new to this. ; First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct? And then make_examples in training mode should be run multiple times independently for training and validation sets? If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. . Thank you very much for your time, and if these questions are answered clearly in a doc already, then I apologize and would appreciate being directed there. . Best, ; Haley . Here is the error traceback: ; `Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/project/pbarc/haley.arnold/condaenvs/tensorflow/lib/python3.11
",False,"The content contains a mix of natural language text and technical details about configuration issues, error handling, and troubleshooting. However, the presence of code snippets or logs is not prominent. The user is seeking advice on version compatibility and has described their process in a narrative form, which includes procedural steps and problem-solving attempts. Additionally, the text includes some questions regarding the proper usage of tools (e.g., make_examples), which are part of the educational content surrounding the use of DeepVariant. Therefore, this text should not be eliminated as it primarily contains explanatory and descriptive content intended to help others understand and resolve issues with their setup."

1. Whether it should be eliminated (true/false)
2. The reason for elimination (if applicable)

Evaluation criteria:
- Eliminate text that consists primarily of:
  * Code snippets or samples (marked by syntax, keywords like ""if/else"", brackets, etc.)
  * Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
  * API documentation or specifications (parameter lists, return types)
  * Configuration files or build system output
  * Version control metadata or comments
  * Compiler/interpreter output or warnings
- Keep text that contains:
  * Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
  * Explanatory or descriptive content
  * Human-written prose discussing concepts or ideas

Your task is to evaluate whether the given text contains meaningful human-readable sentences or if it consists primarily of logs, code samples, or programmatic API description that should be filtered out.

For each input text, analyze it and determine:
1. Whether it should be eliminated (true/false)
2. The reason for elimination (if applicable)

Evaluation criteria:
- Eliminate text that consists primarily of:
  * Code snippets or samples (marked by syntax, keywords like ""if/else"", brackets, etc.)
  * Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
  * API documentation or specifications (parameter lists, return types)
  * Configuration files or build system output
  * Version control metadata or comments
  * Compiler/interpreter output or warnings
- Keep text that contains:
  * Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
  * Explanatory or descriptive content
  * Human-written prose discussing concepts or ideas
