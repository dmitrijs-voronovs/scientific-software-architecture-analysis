Your task is to evaluate whether the given text contains meaningful human-readable sentences or if it consists primarily of logs, code samples, or programmatic API description that should be filtered out.

For each input text, analyze it and determine:
1. Whether it should be eliminated (true/false)
2. The reason for elimination (if applicable)

Evaluation criteria:
- Eliminate text that consists primarily of:
  * Code snippets or samples (marked by syntax, keywords like ""if/else"", brackets, etc.)
  * Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
  * API documentation or specifications (parameter lists, return types)
  * Configuration files or build system output
  * Version control metadata or comments
  * Compiler/interpreter output or warnings
- Keep text that contains:
  * Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
  * Explanatory or descriptive content
  * Human-written prose discussing concepts or ideas

",True,"The content consists primarily of program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces), API documentation, and configuration settings. The text includes command lines and error outputs that are typically found in log files or console output, which should be filtered out as per the evaluation criteria."
