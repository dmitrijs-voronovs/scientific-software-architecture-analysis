Your task is to evaluate whether the given text contains meaningful human-readable sentences or if it consists primarily of logs, code samples, or programmatic API description that should be filtered out.

For each input text, analyze it and determine:
1. Whether it should be eliminated (true/false)
2. The reason for elimination (if applicable)

Evaluation criteria:
- Eliminate text that consists primarily of:
  * Code snippets or samples (marked by syntax, keywords like ""if/else"", brackets, etc.)
  * Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
  * API documentation or specifications (parameter lists, return types)
  * Configuration files or build system output
  * Version control metadata or comments
  * Compiler/interpreter output or warnings
- Keep text that contains:
  * Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
  * Explanatory or descriptive content
  * Human-written prose discussing concepts or ideas
