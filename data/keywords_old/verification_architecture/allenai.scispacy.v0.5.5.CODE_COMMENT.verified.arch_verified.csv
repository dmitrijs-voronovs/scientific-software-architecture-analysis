Availability,"""""""; A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available:; - Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).; - Medical Subject Headings (MESH). To use these configured default KBs, pass the `name` parameter, either 'umls' or 'mesh'. It uses a sklearn.TfidfVectorizer to embed mention text into a sparse embedding of character 3-grams.; These are then compared via cosine distance in a pre-indexed approximate nearest neighbours index of; a subset of all entities and aliases in the KB. Once the K nearest neighbours have been retrieved, they are canonicalized to their KB canonical ids.; This step is required because the index also includes entity aliases, which map to a particular canonical; entity. This point is important for two reasons:. 1. K nearest neighbours will return a list of Y possible neighbours, where Y < K, because the entity ids; are canonicalized. 2. A single string may be an alias for multiple canonical entities. For example, ""Jefferson County"" may be an; alias for both the canonical ids ""Jefferson County, Iowa"" and ""Jefferson County, Texas"". These are completely; valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive; k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings; which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string.

These are completely; valid and important aliases to include, but it means that using the candidate generator to implement a naive; k-nn baseline linker results in very poor performance, because there are multiple entities for some strings; which have an exact char3-gram match, as these entities contain the same alias string. This situation results; in multiple entities returned with a distance of 0.0, because they exactly match an alias, making a k-nn; baseline effectively a random choice between these candidates.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing quality attributes in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to distinguish sentences that clearly relate to a given quality attribute from those that do not. 

Evaluate whether the content accurately aligns with its associated quality attribute, given the context provided. Your goal is to determine if the content makes sense in relation to the quality attribute description or if it is a false positive.

Data:

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: """"""; Expand a token to it's noun phrase based; on a simple POS tag heuristic.; """"""

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The term 'usability' relates directly to how well users can effectively use and accomplish tasks with the software, which aligns with the attribute's description.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: """"""; Expand a token to it's noun phrase based; on a simple POS tag heuristic.; """"""
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses token expansion based on a simple POS tag heuristic, which relates to natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This is more related to implementation details in computational linguistics rather than software architecture."
