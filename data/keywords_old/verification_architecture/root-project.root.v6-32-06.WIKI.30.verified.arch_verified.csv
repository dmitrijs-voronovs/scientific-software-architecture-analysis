The API of the current package differs from the original one, in order to be compliant to the ROOT coding conventions.; SMatrix contains generic Matrix and Vector classes to describe matrix and vector of arbitrary dimensions and of arbitrary type. The classes are templated on the scalar type and on the size of the matrix (number of rows and columns) or the vector. Therefore, the size has to be known at compile time. Since the release 5.10, SMatrix supports symmetric matrices using a storage class (ROOT::Math::MatRepSym) which contains only the N*(N+1)/2 independent element of a NxN symmetric matrix. It is not in the mandate of this package to provide a complete linear algebra functionality for these classes. What is provided are basic Matrix Template Functions and Vector Template Functions, such as the matrix-matrix, matrix-vector, vector-vector operations, plus some extra functionality for square matrices, like inversion, which is based on the optimized Cramer method for squared matrices of size up to 6x6, and determinant calculation. For a more detailed descriptions and usage examples see:. SVector Class Properties; SMatrix Class Properties; Matrix and Vector Operators and Functions. The SMatrix package contains only header files. Normally one does not need to build any library. In the ROOT distribution a library, libSmatrix is produced with the C++ dictionary information for vectors, symmetric and square

",True,"The provided code snippet involves function definitions and parameters related to a medium in a software system. It mentions parameters such as volumeName, name, imed, nmat, isvol, ifield, fieldm, tmaxfd, stemax, deemax, epsil, stmin, and par. These parameters are likely used in the context of deploying or managing media within a software application. The function GetMedium returns kTRUE if there were no errors, indicating successful deployment or retrieval of medium information. The code also includes TGeoMCGeometry class which deals with geometry operations, possibly related to how media are integrated into a system. While not directly mentioning deployment automation or rollback mechanisms mentioned in the Deployability attribute description, the overall context suggests it is about managing and deploying media, which could be part of the deployability process. However, without explicit mention of aspects like automation, speed, or granularity, it's unclear if it directly addresses all key aspects. Nonetheless, the content is related to deployment capabilities.","

",True,"The provided code snippet discusses setting up user interface components like buttons and pads, handling coordinate transformations, and managing ranges for graphical data. These activities are related to how software deploys and operates within an environment, particularly focusing on user interface automation and efficiency. The code touches upon aspects such as deployment speed through efficient use of resources (e.g., range calculations and axis setup) and deployment granularity by ensuring points are correctly positioned and transformed. There's also mention of handling edge cases like button interactions, which could affect the deployability by ensuring proper rollback mechanisms are in place if something goes wrong during deployment. Therefore, this content aligns with the Deployability quality attribute by focusing on deployment automation, speed, and error handling.","

",True,"The content provided appears to involve code for creating and plotting projections using ROOT tools. It includes steps like creating signal and total likelihood projections, defining an LL ratio function, filtering data based on this ratio, generating Monte Carlo events, projecting them, and then producing plots. These activities relate to deploying analysis techniques into an operational environment, specifically for signal projection and likelihood ratio analysis in a physics context. The use of ROOT tools suggests deployment within a specific computational framework. The code focuses on automation (e.g., using ROOT's built-in functions) and efficient deployment practices (e.g., optimizing data selection based on criteria). It also demonstrates deployment speed by generating 10,000 Monte Carlo events and filtering them quickly. Thus, this content aligns with Deployability as it involves deploying software components (ROOT projections, analysis tools) into an environment for effective data processing and analysis.","

",True,"The content provided discusses methods related to setting and retrieving default options for integrators in ROOT::Math::BaseIntegratorOptions, such as Print(), SetDefaultIntegrator(), SetDefaultAbsTolerance(), etc. These methods are part of the software's configuration management, allowing for predictable deployment by users who can set up their integration options before execution. The ability to manage these settings and deploy them effectively contributes to the Deployability of the software. Specifically, the presence of default options that can be modified and printed, along with the ability to reset or roll back integrator configurations if needed, supports the key aspects mentioned in the Deployability attribute: automation (via automatic setting of defaults), deployment speed (through quick configuration changes and printing), and deployment granularity (by allowing specific options to be set or cleared as needed).

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content is a series of log lines related to minimum test errors and saving configurations at each step (from line 135 to 153). These logs indicate that during testing, an error occurred, prompting a save of the configuration for potential rollback. This aligns with deployability as deployment often requires robust error handling and rollbacks to maintain predictable deployment efforts.","

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided contains multiple lines of test results and configurations saved due to minimum test errors. This suggests issues during deployment which could affect deployability, specifically in terms of automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity as mentioned in the quality attribute. The mention of 'save the configuration' indicates potential rollbacks if needed, which ties into deployability.","

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided consists entirely of log entries with values such as 'Minimum Test error found' and numerical data. These logs indicate issues encountered during testing, which relate to the deployability of software by highlighting potential errors that could affect deployment. The mention of saving configurations suggests attempts to handle deployment issues, contributing to deployability through rollback capabilities.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided appears to be a series of log entries related to 'Minimum Test error found' occurring at various points (from 361 to 378). This is a form of logging that could be associated with deployment processes, indicating issues that arise during testing phases. The fact that each entry includes numerical values and specific identifiers suggests it's tracking the progress or status of deployments, which aligns with deployability by providing insights into how well software is being deployed and whether there are errors or problems that need to be addressed before final deployment. Therefore, this content reflects aspects related to the deployability quality attribute by showing potential issues during deployment that could impact the predictability and efficiency of the deployment process.","

",True,"The provided content discusses various API functions related to setting values, errors, fixing parameters, releasing parameters, setting limits, and more. These functions are part of the software's configuration and parameter management system. The context seems to be about how parameters can be manipulated programmatically, such as setting their values, handling errors, fixing them if necessary, releasing changes after modification, setting bounds for parameters, and so on. This relates directly to Deployability because it ensures that these operations can be performed efficiently and predictably during deployment. Additionally, the ability to rollback changes or revert parameter settings is mentioned through functions like fix() and release(), which ties into the rollback capability required for deployability.","

Integration methods selection through various categories ensures that the software can handle different types of calculations efficiently, which is crucial for maintaining performance during deployment. Therefore, this content is relevant to Deployability as it covers aspects such as automation, configuration setup, and deployment readiness.","

",True,"The content provided appears to be a snippet from a C++ file, possibly part of a software library related to data analysis or physics simulations. It includes method declarations and definitions with parameters like Int_t and Double_t, which are typical in ROOT, a popular data analysis framework. The presence of methods for parameter handling, such as GetParameter, SetParameter, and IsFixed, suggests functionality around managing parameters in a fitting context. This aligns with aspects of deployability, particularly deployment speed and ease of configuration. However, the code snippet does not explicitly reference deployment processes or tools but rather focuses on parameter management. While this supports deployability indirectly by ensuring that parameters can be set and retrieved efficiently, it's more directly related to functionality than deployment mechanics. Therefore, it's a partial match and could be considered a true positive for deployability if focusing broadly. However, without explicit evidence of deployment automation or rollback mechanisms mentioned in the code, it might lean towards false positive.","

This fixes ROOT-8031.; Fast Cloning We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address ROOT-5078. It can be controlled from the TTreeCloner, TTree::CopyEntries or hadd interfaces. The new cache is enabled by default, to update the size of the cache or disable it from TTreeCloner use: TTreeCloner::SetCacheSize. To do the same from TTree::CopyEntries add to the option string “cachesize=SIZE”. To update the size of the cache or disable it from hadd, use the command line option -cachesize SIZE. SIZE shouyld be given in number bytes and can be expressed in ‘human readable form’ (number followed by size unit like MB, MiB, GB or GiB, etc. or SIZE can be set zero to disable the cache. Histogram Libraries. Protect access to TROOT::GetListOfGlobalFunctions in TFormula. Math. Update MixMax random number generator for 32 bit architectures. TColor. Import TColor from master to make sure the high quality palettes are defined only ones. This was requested here. PyROOT. Fix case where c++ exception in a constructor were not propagated to python ROOT-7864; Fix case where PyROOT was unable to call copy constructor ROOT-7783; Fix handling of vector<enums> ROOT-7916; Fix the wrong return value when calling a c++ function returning short, or when retuning a char with a negative value ROOT-7872; Added a new configuration option (ROOT.PyConfig.DisableRootLogon) to disable processing of the rootlogon[.py|C] macro in addition to the -n option in

Functions, Random Numbers, Histogram Fits; Size & compression factor of a ROOT file; Purge, Reuse of gaps in TFile; 2D Histograms, Functions, 2D Fits; Graphics & PostScript; Subdirectories in a ROOT file; TNtuple, Selections, TCutG, TEventList; Split and Compression modes for Trees; Analyze Event.root file of stress 8; Create 10 files starting from Event.root; Test chains of Trees using the 10 files; Compare histograms of test 9 and 11; Merging files of a chain; Check correct rebuilt of Event.root in test 13; Divert Tree branches to separate files; Cling test (3 nested loops) with LHCb trigger. The program stress takes one argument, the number of events to process. The default is 1000 events. Be aware that executing stress with 1000 eventswill create several files consuming about 100 MB of disk space; running stress with 30 events will consume about 20 MB. The disk space is released once stress is done.; There are two ways to run stress:; From the system prompt or from the ROOT prompt using the interpreter.; > cd $ROOTSYS/test; > stress // default 1000 events; > stress 30 // test with 30 events; Start ROOT with the batch mode option (-b) to suppress the graphic output.; > root -b; root[] .L stress.cxx; root[] stress(1000)// test with 1000 events; root[] stress(30)// test with 30 events; The output of stress includes a pass/fail conclusion for each test, the total number of bytes read and written, and the elapsed real and CPU time. It also calculates a performance index for your machine relative to a reference machine a DELL Inspiron 7500 (Pentium III 600 MHz) with 256 MB of memory and 18GB IDE disk in ROOTMARKS. Higher ROOTMARKS means better performance. The reference machine has 200 ROOTMARKS, so the sample run below with 53.7 ROOTMARKS is about four times slower than the reference machine.; Here is a sample run:; % root -b; root[] .x stress.cxx(30).

",False,"The content provided consists of two functions from a C++ codebase, GetIconPath and GetTTFFontDir. These appear to be utility functions that handle file paths for icons and fonts in a ROOT installation. The code uses preprocessor directives to determine the values used, and it initializes static strings to store these paths if they are not already set. The functions also use gSystem->PrependPathName() to prepend the root system path with the specified directory. The code is focused on managing file path configurations within a C++ application, which relates more to implementation details rather than software architecture. There's no discussion of architectural patterns, high-level design, trade-offs, or scalability concerns; instead, it deals with specific configuration and setup tasks that are part of the development process but not the architecture."

In this way, the network of pointers and their objects is rebuilt and ready to use the same way it was used before it was persistent. If the pointer hold the address of an object which in embedded in another object (as opposed to being pointed to by a pointer), the object will be duplicate at read time. To avoid this, make the pointer a transient data member.; 11.4.2 Motivation for the TRef Class; If the object is split into several files or into several branches of one or more TTrees, standard C++ pointers cannot be used because each I/O operation will write the referenced objects, and multiple copies will exist. In addition, if the pointer is read before the referenced object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address these limitations, ROOT offers the TRef class.; TRef allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in a different file. TRef also supports the complex situation where a TFile is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different machine. When a TRef is read before its referenced object, it is null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the TRef points to it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by TRef in the case it is read before its reference object (see“Action on Demand” below).; 11.4.3 Using TRef; A TRef is a lightweight object pointing to any TObject. This object can be used instead of normal C++ pointers in case:.

",True,"The content discusses TRef class and its use in ROOT for object references across files and branches to avoid issues with standard pointers. This relates to deployment considerations in software, particularly in handling complex object dependencies and ensuring that references are correctly managed during deployment. The ability to reference objects across different files or Tree branches and handle updates or reads before the referenced object is available aligns with deployability aspects like deployment speed, automation, and deployment granularity. By managing these references efficiently, ROOT ensures that the software can be deployed predictably and efficiently, which falls under deployability.","

Using draw options in trees. The draw options are the same as for TH1::Draw. See “Draw Options” where they are listed. In addition to the draw options defined in TH1, there are three more. The 'prof' and 'profs' draw a profile histogram (TProfile) rather than a regular 2D histogram (TH2D) from an expression with two variables. If the expression has three variables, a TProfile2D is generated.; The ‘profs’ generates a TProfile with error on the spread. The ‘prof’ option generates a TProfile with error on the mean. The “goff” option suppresses generating the graphics. You can combine the draw options in a list separated by commas. After typing the lines above, you should now have a canvas that looks this.; 12.20.5 Superimposing Two Histograms; When superimposing two 2-D histograms inside a script with TTree::Draw and using the “same” option, you will need to update the pad between Draw commands.; {; // superimpose two 2D scatter plots; // Create a 2D histogram and fill it with random numbers; TH2 *h2 = new TH2D (""h2"",""2D histo"",100,0,70,100,0,20000);; for (Int_t i = 0; i < 10000; i++); h2->Fill(gRandom->Gaus(40,10),gRandom->Gaus(10000,3000));; // set the color to differentiate it visually; h2->SetMarkerColor(kGreen);; h2->Draw();; // Open the example file and get the tree; TFile f(""cernstaff.root"");; TTree *myTree = (TTree*)f.Get(""T"");; // the update is needed for the next draw command to work properly; gPad->Update();; myTree->Draw(""Cost:Age"", """",""same"");; }; In this example, h2->Draw is only adding the object h2 to the pad’s list of primitives.
