Since the DeepVariant v0.9 release, we recommend; ""[Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md)"". For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced; [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md); in v1.1. ## Why am I seeing ""CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error"" while running on GPU?.

We; have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So; you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. ## How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models?. 16GB. In our test, we observe the model occupying 16GB GPU memory. ## Do models from before r1.6.0 work with current inference code?. No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in; Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. ## Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs?.

Deployability,"# DeepVariant Genomic VCF (gVCF) support. Beginning with the 0.5.0 release, DeepVariant supports the creation of Genomic; VCF (gVCF) output. This has the same underlying format specification as the; [VCF format] but also includes additional records that distinguish regions that; have sequence coverage that appears to match the reference genome from regions; without sequence coverage, in which the genotype is unknown. gVCF files are required as input for analyses that create a set of variants in; a cohort of individuals, such as cohort merging or joint genotyping. ## Description of gVCF format. When run with gVCF output enabled, DeepVariant generates both the VCF output; containing only variant calls as well as an additional gVCF output file that; contains both variants and non-variant sites. The gVCF file includes both; variant calls and regions that are confidently called as matching the reference; genome. The non-variant sites compare the reference allele to an ""unspecified; alternate"" allele, represented by `<*>`. To minimize output file size, adjacent; records with equal (or similar, see discussion below) genotype qualities are; merged into a single record.

Content: # DeepVariant Genomic VCF (gVCF) support. Beginning with the 0.5.0 release, DeepVariant supports the creation of Genomic; VCF (gVCF) output. This has the same underlying format specification as the; [VCF format] but also includes additional records that distinguish regions that; have sequence coverage that appears to match the reference genome from regions; without sequence coverage, in which the genotype is unknown. gVCF files are required as input for analyses that create a set of variants in; a cohort of individuals, such as cohort merging or joint genotyping. ## Description of gVCF format. When run with gVCF output enabled, DeepVariant generates both the VCF output; containing only variant calls as well as an additional gVCF output file that; contains both variants and non-variant sites. The gVCF file includes both; variant calls and regions that are confidently called as matching the reference; genome. The non-variant sites compare the reference allele to an ""unspecified; alternate"" allele, represented by `<*>`. To minimize output file size, adjacent; records with equal (or similar, see discussion below) genotype qualities are; merged into a single record. Section 5.5 of the [VCF format] specification gives a description of the gVCF; format and example output, partially reproduced below.

Content: ## Building DeepVariant from sources. DeepVariant comes with scripts to build it on Ubuntu 20.04. It can likely be; built and run on other unix-based systems with some minimal modifications to; these scripts. One way to get access to a machine running Ubuntu is through a; cloud computing platform like Google Cloud Engine. First install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads),; because we will need to use its `gsutil` command to fetch some dependencies. The `build-prereq.sh` command below will install a number of system packages to; fulfill DeepVariant's prerequisites (using apt-get and pip, invoked via sudo).; This commands also downloads and builds TensorFlow and CLIF from source.

Content: ; Google Cloud Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data; through the corresponding public URLs. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepTrio in one command. Although DeepTrio can be built from a source, we provide a docker image that; allows to run through all steps in one command to generate VCF/gVCF output files; from input BAM files and the reference. If you want to compile the binaries for yourself, we also have a [Dockerfile]; that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the [docker build]; documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. For each sample, one aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its; corresponding index file (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a; sequencing instrument, using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}.

For the models we've released over time, you can find more details about the; training data in; [DeepVariant training data](deepvariant-details-training-data.md). ## CRAM support. As of v0.7, DeepVariant accepts CRAM files as input in addition to BAM files. As of v0.9.0, we changed the default to use the reference file specified by the; `--ref` flag, instead of the path to the original reference in the CRAM file; (encoded in the file's ""UR"" tag). For more information about CRAM, see the; [`samtools` documentation](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) in general; but particularly the sections on; [Global Options](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#GLOBAL_OPTIONS) and; [reference sequences in CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#REFERENCE_SEQUENCES). `htslib` also hosts a nice page; [benchmarking CRAM](

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided in the code snippets and commands appears to be focused on downloading data files necessary for deploying the DeepVariant software. The commands use wget to download various fasta, faidx, and gzipped data files into an input directory. This is related to making sure that the required reference data is available for the tool to function properly during deployment. Additionally, there are mentions of Docker containers being used to run DeepVariant with specific versions and model types. The commands create output directories and use volumes (-v) to mount these directories within the Docker container. These actions collectively contribute to the deployability by ensuring that all necessary data is in place for a smooth deployment process. Therefore, this content aligns well with the Deployability quality attribute as it ensures the software can be deployed efficiently and reliably.","

",True,"The provided content appears to be a script snippet related to running a variant calling tool. The flags mentioned include parameters for input files, output directories, and processing options. These settings are intended to optimize resource use by specifying regions of interest, reference genomes, and parallelization settings. By restricting the analysis to specific regions (chr20 CDS) and using efficient processing parameters like split_skip_reads=true, it aims to minimize unnecessary computations and focus resources on relevant data. Additionally, the output is directed to an intermediate directory, which can help manage memory usage and prevent bottlenecks. This aligns with the concept of energy efficiency in software as it involves optimizing resource utilization without compromising performance (variant calling accuracy). The use of --num_shards=$(nproc) indicates parallel processing based on available processors, which is a common strategy to leverage hardware resources effectively. The overall script seems to be configured to perform efficiently by focusing only on necessary computations and utilizing available resources optimally.","

And then run GLnexus with this config:. ```; sudo docker pull quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7. time sudo docker run \; -v ""${DIR}"":""/data"" \; quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7 \; /usr/local/bin/glnexus_cli \; --config DeepVariantWES \; --bed ""/data/${CAPTURE_BED}"" \; /data/HG004.g.vcf.gz /data/HG003.g.vcf.gz /data/HG002.g.vcf.gz \; | sudo docker run -i google/deepvariant:${VERSION} bcftools view - \; | sudo docker run -i google/deepvariant:${VERSION} bgzip -c \; > ${DIR}/deepvariant.cohort.vcf.gz; ```. When we ran on this WES trio, it took only about 13 seconds. For more details on; performance, see; [GLnexus performance guide](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/wiki/Performance). For a WGS cohort, we recommend using `--config DeepVariantWGS` instead of; `DeepVariantWES`.

",True,"The content describes graphical representations showing runtime distributions of tasks and regions in a software system. It discusses how different regions contribute to total runtime, the variability across stages, and highlights long-running regions. These concepts relate to modifiability as they allow for understanding where performance bottlenecks exist, which can be modified or adjusted later on. The descriptions involve analyzing task runtimes and identifying areas that take longer, which is part of assessing how adaptable the system is to changes. Therefore, it aligns with modifiability.","

This procedure updates both the position and the CIGAR string for; > each read. Local realignment is not performed for long reads (PacBio, and other similar; technologies). The realigner step can optionally be switched off using; `--norealign_reads`. There is also the option to output the realigned reads, e.g. to inspect the new; alignments in IGV. This can be done by passing the following parameters:; `--make_examples_extra_args=""emit_realigned_reads=true,realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads""`.

Shuffling the `tensorflow.Example`s is an important step for training a model.; In our training logic, we shuffle examples globally using a preprocessing step. First, if you have run this step before, and want to rerun it, you might want to; consider cleaning up previous data first to avoid confusion:. ```bash; # (Optional) Clean up existing files.; gsutil -m rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/training_set.with_label.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; gsutil rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/training_set.dataset_config.pbtxt""; gsutil -m rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/validation_set.with_label.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; gsutil rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/validation_set.dataset_config.pbtxt""; gsutil rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/example_info.json""; ```.

Of all biallelic SNPs, this shows the counts from a particular REF (along the; top labeling the four charts) to a particular ALT (each bar within the charts; labeled at the bottom). See the Ti/Tv section for a brief explanation of why; some of these base changes tend to be more frequent than others. RefCalls and; multi-allelic variants are not included. ### Biallelic Ti/Tv ratio. Transition (Ti) count is the number of biallelic SNPs going from purine->purine; or pyrimidine->pyrimidine, where purines are A and G, pyrimidines are C and T.; Transversions (Tv) are purine->pyrimidine or pyrimidine->purine. Transitions; are biologically more likely to occur than transversions due to the molecular; structure of the bases, so a ratio well above one is desirable. This; [article](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/6308/evaluating-the-quality-of-a-variant-callset); on the GATK forums has a good discussion of how to interpret the ratio. These; include all biallelic SNPs, excluding RefCalls. ### Biallelic indel size distribution. The sizes of all biallelic insertions and deletions are shown as histograms. The; top and bottom plots show the same data, just on a linear scale on top and on a; log scale on the bottom.

Of all biallelic SNPs, this shows the counts from a particular REF (along the; top labeling the four charts) to a particular ALT (each bar within the charts; labeled at the bottom). See the Ti/Tv section for a brief explanation of why; some of these base changes tend to be more frequent than others. RefCalls and; multi-allelic variants are not included. ### Biallelic Ti/Tv ratio. Transition (Ti) count is the number of biallelic SNPs going from purine->purine; or pyrimidine->pyrimidine, where purines are A and G, pyrimidines are C and T.; Transversions (Tv) are purine->pyrimidine or pyrimidine->purine. Transitions; are biologically more likely to occur than transversions due to the molecular; structure of the bases, so a ratio well above one is desirable. This; [article](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/6308/evaluating-the-quality-of-a-variant-callset); on the GATK forums has a good discussion of how to interpret the ratio. These; include all biallelic SNPs, excluding RefCalls. ### Biallelic indel size distribution. The sizes of all biallelic insertions and deletions are shown as histograms. The; top and bottom plots show the same data, just on a linear scale on top and on a; log scale on the bottom. RefCalls and multi-allelic variants are not included. ## Examples. ### WGS case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of WGS HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/WGS_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png). ### WES case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of WES HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/WES_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png). ### PacBio case study HG002 (DeepVariant v0.10.0). ![visual report of PacBio HG002 case study v0.10.0](images/PacBio_HG002.v0.10.0_visual_report.png).

We; currently represent the data as a 6-channel raw tensor in which we encode:. * The read base (A, C, G, T); * The base's quality score; * The read's mapping quality score; * The read's strand (positive or negative); * Does the read support the allele being evaluated?; * Does the base match the reference genome at this position?.

Data:

Content: rio. ## Background. To get started, we've provided a Docker image, and some test data in a bucket on; Google Cloud Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data; through the corresponding public URLs. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepTrio in one command. Although DeepTrio can be built from a source, we provide a docker image that; allows to run through all steps in one command to generate VCF/gVCF output files; from input BAM files and the reference. If you want to compile the binaries for yourself, we also have a [Dockerfile]; that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the [docker build]; documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. For each sample, one aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its; corresponding index file (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a; sequencing instrument, using an aligner like [BWA] for example. We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that; can be downloaded to your instance from the public URLs. Download the test bundle:. ```bash; INPUT_DIR=""${PWD}/quickstart-testdata""; mkdir -p ${INPUT_DIR}.

Fourth and finally, if running in training mode the `truth_vcf` and; `confident_regions` arguments should point to VCF and BED files containing the; true variants and regions where we are confident in our calls (i.e., calls; within these regions and not in the truth_vcf are considered false positives).; These should be bgzipped and tabix indexed and be on a reference consistent with; the one provided with the `--ref` argument. ### call_variants. `call_variants` consumes TFRecord file(s) of tf.Examples protos created; by `make_examples` and a deep learning model checkpoint and evaluates the model; on each example in the input TFRecord. The output here is a TFRecord of; CallVariantsOutput protos. `call_variants` doesn't directly support sharding its; outputs, but accepts a glob or shard-pattern for its inputs. `call_variants` uses around 4 GB per process and uses TensorFlow for evaluation.; When evaluating a model in CPU mode, TensorFlow can make use of multiple cores,; but scaling is sub-linear. In other words, `call_variants` on a 64 core machine; is less than 8x faster than running on a 8 core machine. When using a GPU, `call_variants` is both faster, more efficient, and needs; fewer CPUs. Based on a small number of experiments, currently the most efficient; configuration for `call_variants` on a GPU instance is 4-8 CPUs and 1 GPU.; Compared to our setting in the [whole genome case study], we noticed a 2.5x; speedup on the call_variants step using a single P100 GPU and 8 CPUs. Note that; currently `call_variants` can only use one GPU at most.

On most filesystems this actually looks like; 10 distinct files `filename-00000-of-00010`, ..., `filename-00009-of-00010`.; DeepVariant can write sharded files using their `filename@10`-style name and; can read sharded files using both that style as well as the glob form, such; as `filename-*` or `filename-*-of-00010`.; * Files with the `.gz` suffix are interpreted as being compressed with gzip; and are read/written accordingly. ### make_examples. `make_examples` consumes reads and the reference genome to create TensorFlow; examples for evaluation with our deep learning models. The tf.Example protos are; written out in TFRecord format. To learn more about tf.Example and TFRecord, see; the; [Using TFRecords and tf.Example](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord); Co
