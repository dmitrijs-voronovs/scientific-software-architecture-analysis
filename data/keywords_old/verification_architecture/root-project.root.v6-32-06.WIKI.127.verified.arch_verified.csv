Content: Ball shape:. symmetric or asymmetric power-law tails on both sides; different width parameters for the left and right sides of the Gaussian core. The new RooCrystalBall class can substitute the RooDSCBShape and RooSDSCBShape, which were passed around in the community.; 2D Graphics Libraries. Add the method AddPointto TGraph(x,y) and TGraph2D(x,y,z), equivalent to SetPoint(g->GetN(),x,y)and SetPoint(g->GetN(),x,y,z); Option E0 draws error bars and markers are drawn for bins with 0 contents. Now, combined with options E1 and E2, it avoids error bars clipping.; Fix TAxis::ChangeLabel for vertical axes and 3D plots. Networking Libraries; Multithreaded support for FastCGI; Now when THttpServer creates FastCGI engine, 10 worker threads used to process requests received via FastCGI channel. This significantly increase a performance, especially when several clients are connected.; Better security for THttpServer with webgui; If THttpServer created for use with webgui widgets (RBrowser, RCanvas, REve), it only will provide access to the widgets via websocket connection - any other kind of requests like root.json or exe.json will be refused completely. Combined with connection tokens and https protocol, this makes usage of webgui components in public networks more secure.; Enabled WLCG Bearer Tokens support in RDavix; Bearer tokens are part of WLCG capability-based infrastructure with capability-based scheme which uses an infrastructure that describes what the bearer is allowed to do as opposed to who that bearer is. Token discovery procedure are developed according to the WLCG Bearer Token Discovery specification document. Short overview:. If the BEARER_TOKEN environment variable is set, then the value is taken to be the token contents.; If the BEARER_TOKEN_FILE environment variable is set, then its value is interpreted as a filename.

Data:

Content: GetAxis(12)->SetRange(from_bin, to_bin);. * Internal Representation; An entry for a filled bin consists of its n-dimensional coordinates and; its bin content. The coordinates are compacted to use as few bits as; possible; e.g. a histogram with 10 bins in x and 20 bins in y will only; use 4 bits for the x representation and 5 bits for the y representation.; This is handled by the internal class THnSparseCompactBinCoord.; Bin data (content and coordinates) are allocated in chunks of size; fChunkSize; this parameter can be set when constructing a THnSparse. Each; chunk is represented by an object of class THnSparseArrayChunk. Translation from an n-dimensional bin coordinate to the linear index within; the chunks is done by GetBin(). It creates a hash from the compacted bin; coordinates (the hash of a bin coordinate is the compacted coordinate itself; if it takes less than 8 bytes, the size of a Long64_t.; This hash is used to lookup the linear index in the TExMap member fBins;; the coordinates of the entry fBins points to is compared to the coordinates; passed to GetBin(). If they do not match, these two coordinates have the same; hash - which is extremely unlikely but (for the case where the compact bin; coordinates are larger than 4 bytes) possible. In this case, fBinsContinued; contains a chain of linear indexes with the same hash. Iterating through this; chain and comparing each bin coordinates with the one passed to GetBin() will; retrieve the matching bin.

",True,"The content provided appears to be code snippets from a software library or framework, specifically related to window management in a graphical user interface. It includes method declarations and overrides, such as HandleTimer, IconifyWindow, LowerWindow, RaiseWindow, RequestFocus, SetName, SetWindowName, Streamer, and others. These methods are part of the TGObject class, which seems to handle window operations. The presence of methods related to window management suggests that the system has control over how windows behave, which contributes to security by allowing authorized actions (e.g., raising or lowering windows) while preventing unauthorized access or misuse. For example, ensuring that only authorized users can modify window states or access certain functionalities ties into the concept of security as described in the attribute. The content does not contain any obvious signs of security vulnerabilities, malicious code, or lapses in protection measures. Instead, it appears to be part of a secure system that manages windows in a controlled manner. Therefore, this content aligns with the security quality attribute by addressing how the system protects its resources and enforces access controls.","

",True,"The provided code snippet demonstrates how URLs are generated for enumerations in a system. The code involves hashing enum names to create unique identifiers and constructs URLs based on these hashes. This process ensures that resources related to specific enumerations can be accessed securely. By using MD5 hashing, the system prevents unauthorized access by ensuring that only legitimate users can generate correct URLs. Additionally, the URL structure includes '#a' followed by the hashed values, adding layers of security against potential attacks or misuse. The focus is on creating secure and unique URLs for enumeration resources, which directly relates to the concept of Security in software systems as it safeguards information through confidentiality measures like hashing and proper URL generation.

",True,"The content provided is a sequence of variable declarations and type definitions in a programming language, likely C++. These are structural elements common in software design and development. The presence of variables such as 'id', 'key', 'file', 'offset', 'handle', 'status', 'prefix', 'bufferSize', 'bytesRead', 'cache pointers', 'classIndex', 'compression level', 'directory context', 'descriptor', 'timestamps', etc., along with file operations like reading and writing, indicates a focus on managing and controlling access to resources. This directly relates to the concept of Security as it involves safeguarding data through proper resource management and access control mechanisms. The code appears to be implementing various security measures by handling authentication (e.g., 'AuthPrefix'), enforcing access controls ('TFile::fContext'), and managing file operations securely to prevent unauthorized access and maintain integrity. The use of asynchronous handles and caching strategies also contribute to efficient and secure resource utilization. Therefore, this content accurately reflects the implementation of Security quality attribute through effective management of resources and access control.","

",True,"The code snippet provided includes various methods related to security, such as Cleanup(), CleanupSecContext(), and functions for setting object statistics and destructor flags. These methods are part of a TSecContext class which manages security contexts. The presence of methods like MakeZombie() and handling error reporting (DoError()) suggests an emphasis on security through proper resource management and error handling. Additionally, the use of private attributes like fHost, fUser, and fMethod indicates that the system is tracking and securing access based on context. Therefore, the content aligns with the Security quality attribute by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability through secure resource management and error handling mechanisms.","

",True,"The content describes a class THttpTimer which uses a timer to handle HTTP server processing requests. It includes methods like SetSlow and IsSlow which manage timeouts and slow mode settings. The Timeout() method processes HTTP requests and updates counters related to slow processing. This aligns with the concept of security in that it ensures timely response to server operations, preventing potential issues from prolonged request handling which could expose vulnerabilities or lead to unauthorized access. Thus, this code contributes to maintaining system security by managing timeouts effectively.","

",True,"The provided code snippet discusses various methods related to security contexts, such as setting expiration dates, handling offsets, and cleaning up security contexts. It references functions like IsActive(), Print(), CleanupSecContext(), GetContext(), and others that seem to be managing the security state of a system. The code is case-sensitive when checking method names and handles different options for actions like deactivation ('C' or 'c') and removal ('R' or 'r'). This indicates an emphasis on controlling access and maintaining security through structured methods, aligning with the concept of safeguarding information while allowing authorized access. Additionally, functions like IsActive() check for remote settings, which ties into availability and monitoring of security states. The presence of method checks (IsA) suggests specificity in managing security contexts, which enhances both integrity and confidentiality by ensuring correct behavior. The code also handles cleanup operations, which relates to removing sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access after it is no longer needed. Overall, the content focuses on maintaining and enforcing security measures through a series of controlled actions and checks, fitting squarely within the definitions provided for the Security quality attribute.","

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content discusses websockets call-backs and thread safety using mutexes, which relates to secure handling of data access and preventing unauthorized access through proper threading practices. It also mentions callbacks being executed in the window thread and methods for managing connections, including removing them safely. The use of static functions like HMAC and setting start dialog functions might be part of security measures. Private attributes like fCallbacksThrdId and mutex f are related to thread management, which supports security by ensuring operations are atomic and threads are properly managed. Overall, these practices align with safeguarding information through secure coding techniques that prevent unauthorized access while allowing authorized access.","
