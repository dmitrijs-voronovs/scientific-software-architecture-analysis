Content: """"""\; Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells (MAGIC) API :cite:p:`vanDijk2018`. MAGIC is an algorithm for denoising and transcript recover of single cells; applied to single-cell sequencing data. MAGIC builds a graph from the data; and uses diffusion to smooth out noise and recover the data manifold. The algorithm implemented here has changed primarily in two ways; compared to the algorithm described in :cite:t:`vanDijk2018`. Firstly, we use; the adaptive kernel described in :cite:t:`Moon2019` for; improved stability. Secondly, data diffusion is applied; in the PCA space, rather than the data space, for speed and; memory improvements. More information and bug reports; `here <https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/MAGIC>`__. For help, visit; <https://krishnaswamylab.org/get-help>. Parameters; ----------; adata; An anndata file with `.raw` attribute representing raw counts.; name_list; Denoised genes to return. The default `'all_genes'`/`None`; may require a large amount of memory if the input data is sparse.; Another possibility is `'pca_only'`.; knn; number of nearest neighbors on which to build kernel.; decay; sets decay rate of kernel tails.; If None, alpha decaying kernel is not used.; knn_max; maximum number of nearest neighbors with nonzero connection.; If `None`, will be set to 3 * `knn`.; t; power to which the diffusion operator is powered.; This sets the level of diffusion. If 'auto', t is selected; according to the Procrustes disparity of the diffused data.; n_pca; Number of principal components to use for calculating; neighborhoods.
