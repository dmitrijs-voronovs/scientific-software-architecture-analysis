",True,"The provided code snippets are part of an object-oriented framework, likely related to a visualization tool given the method names (e.g., TEveElement). They include methods for setting various properties like colors, slices, transformations, and user data. While deployment-related terms aren't directly present, these settings could influence how the application is configured and displayed, potentially affecting its deployability by ensuring proper configuration before deployment. Therefore, even though there's no direct mention of deployment steps, the code contributes to overall system readiness for deployment.","

",True,"The content provided includes various method declarations and function signatures related to setting options, configuration, and interactions within an object-oriented system. These methods likely contribute to the deployment process by allowing for flexible configuration and control over how the software is deployed. The presence of automation-related functions (e.g., `SetDispatchTimer` or `SetProcessing`) further suggests a focus on making deployment efficient and repeatable. Additionally, functions like `UpdateAutoBin`, `UpdateProgressInfo`, and `Write` may handle automated deployment steps, data serialization, and output management, all of which support deployability by ensuring predictable deployment processes and outcomes. Overall, this content aligns with the concept of Deployability as it demonstrates the ability to manage deployment efficiently and effectively through automation and structured methods.","

We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression may slow down the program’s performance.

The most significant difference is in reading a file without compression.; The file size with compression, write times with and without compression and the read times with and without compression all favor the TClonesArray.; 12.23 Impact of Compression on I/O; This benchmark illustrates the pros and cons of the compression option. We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression may slow down the program’s performance. The standard test program $ROOTSYS/test/Event was used in various configurations with 400 events. The data file contains a TTree. The program was invoked with:; Event 400 comp split. comp = 0 means: no compression at all.; comp = 1 means: compress everything if split = 0.; comp = 1 means: compress only the tree branches with integers if split = 1.; comp = 2 means: compress everything if split=1.; split = 0 : the full event is serialized into one single buffer.; split = 1 : the event is split into branches. One branch for each data member of the Event class. The list of tracks (a TClonesArray) has the data members of the Track class also split into individual buffers. These tests were run on Pentium III CPU with 650 MHz.

",True,"The code snippets provided describe a set of functions and variables related to transforming data, including methods for attaching XML descriptions, reading inputs from XML nodes, creating functions, preparing transformations, transforming events, inverse transforming, setting enabled flags, normalizing, toggling input order, writing/reading transformations, printing transformations, and accessing variable information. These functions collectively allow for the deployment of transformation logic into an operational environment with precise control over deployment parameters such as normalization and enabled states. The ability to automate these steps (e.g., through methods like SetEnabled or ReadFromXML) supports efficient deployment. Additionally, the presence of rollback mechanisms implied by deployment considerations indicates a capacity for controlled rollbacks if needed. Therefore, this content aligns well with the deployability quality attribute by providing the necessary infrastructure and automation for effective deployment.","

",True,"The content provided is a sequence of C++ code snippets related to a graph class. The first function, RemovePoint, appears to modify the list of points in a graph by deleting one point and adjusting the data structure accordingly. This functionality is crucial for controlling deployment aspects like data management during deployment. The second function, SaveAs, allows saving the graph in various formats which can facilitate testing and analysis without the need for additional tools, enhancing deployment efficiency. Both functions relate to how the software handles its operational environment through efficient data handling and deployment options. Therefore, these code snippets directly support Deployability by enabling controlled modifications and data management that are essential for predictable and efficient deployments.","

",True,"The code snippet discusses thread local directories and context handling, which relates to how software components are managed during deployment. Specifically, it deals with updating gDirectory references when moving from one directory to another. This involves logic for determining the next directory to use (either the mother directory or a global root) and updating thread-local variables accordingly. The code also includes waiting loops for context spinning and register attempts. While not directly about deployment options like automation or rollback, this snippet is part of the deployment process itself. Therefore, it aligns with Deployability as it contributes to deploying software by correctly managing directories during runtime.","

While these classes are implementation details rather than high-level quality attributes, they contribute to the deployability by ensuring that the statistical functions are correctly implemented and can be deployed as part of a larger system. The use of automated processes for deployment (e.g., through build systems) is implied, which supports deployability.

",True,"The provided content is a series of code snippets related to data manipulation and operations in ROOT (a data analysis framework). It demonstrates the use of functions like reduce(), merge(), append() to create subsets, merged, and appended datasets. The operations involve selecting specific columns, filtering data points based on conditions (e.g., y>5.17), and combining datasets. These actions align with the attribute description which focuses on optimizing resource use by efficiently managing and adapting data resources through monitoring, allocation, and adaptation. By reducing unnecessary computations, merging, appending, and selectively processing data, the code aims to minimize energy consumption in the system's operation. Therefore, this content accurately reflects energy efficiency as it shows how resources are managed effectively and efficiently.","

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided code snippet uses several cases (101 to 104) which correspond to different color schemes (South West, Starry Night, Sunset, Temperature Map). Each case sets up arrays for red, green, and blue colors with specific values divided by 255. These values represent color channels in an image, indicating how each color component should be set for a particular scene. The code uses CreateGradientColorTable to generate a gradient based on these stops (presumably the number of color stops) and then assigns Idx as the index for the color table. This is related to optimizing the use of resources (like memory or processing time) by efficiently setting up colors without unnecessary computations. By pre-defining specific color schemes, it avoids redundant calculations and minimizes energy consumption during rendering. Therefore, this content aligns with the quality attribute of Energy Efficiency as it focuses on resource optimization and minimal energy usage.","

",True,"The provided code snippet discusses color values and their gradients for different cases (106-109). The operations involve creating gradient color tables with specific red, green, and blue values, which are fractions of 255. This optimization of color allocation and use can be seen as an effort to minimize unnecessary computations or resource usage in rendering. By setting precise color values, the system may avoid overuse of resources, thus aligning with energy efficiency.","

To see te differences do: TFile f(""hsimple.root""); hpx->Draw(""BAR1""); // non ntuple histogram ntuple->Draw(""px""); // ntuple histogram Non ntuple histogram: 'Rebin': with the Slider the number of bins (shown in the field below the Slider) can be changed to any number which divides the number of bins of the original histogram. Pushing 'Apply' will delete the origin histogram and replace it by the rebinned one on the screen Pushing 'Ignore' the origin histogram will be restored Histogram drawn from an ntuple: 'Rebin' with the slider the number of bins can be enlarged by a factor of 2,3,4,5 (moving to the right) or reduced by a factor of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 'BinOffset': with the BinOffset slider the origin of the histogram can be changed within one binwidth Using this slider the effect of binning the data into bins can be made visible => statistical fluctuations 'Axis Range': with the DoubleSlider it is possible to zoom into the specified axis range. It is also possible to set the upper and lower limit in fields below the slider 'Delayed drawing': all the Binning sliders can set to delay draw mode. Then the changes on the histogram are only updated, when the Slider is released. This should be activated if the redrawing of the histogram is too time consuming. // ; Definition at line 33 of file TH1Editor.h.

",True,"The provided code snippet includes several functions related to resource management and data handling, such as Allocate, CopyAndRelease, and UpdateArrays. These functions appear to manage the allocation, copying, and updating of arrays which are critical for the system's ability to efficiently use resources. The functions involve operations that minimize the consumption of resources by reusing or efficiently allocating them. For example, the ExpandAndCopy function seems to dynamically resize arrays as needed without unnecessary waste. The functions also handle data points in a way that preserves performance, such as updating arrays with sorted values for efficient access. Overall, these functions contribute to optimizing resource use and minimizing energy consumption while maintaining required system performance.

",True,"The provided code snippet contains several mathematical functions related to complex numbers and their trigonometric and hyperbolic counterparts (e.g., Sin, Cos, Tan, etc.). These functions are used to perform calculations involving trigonometric identities and transformations. While the functions themselves may not directly reference energy efficiency, they are essential components that could be part of a larger system designed to optimize resource use. The presence of complex number operations might indicate that the code is dealing with signal processing or optimization algorithms, which are often relevant to energy-efficient systems.

",True,"The code snippets provided discuss various methods related to four-vectors and their Lorentz boosts, specifically focusing on energy and momentum calculations. The functions like isTimelike(), isLightlike(), and isSpacelike() determine the nature of particles based on their energy-momentum relationships. These methods seem to relate to how efficiently resources are being used or energy consumption is being managed in a computational context, which ties into the idea of optimizing resource use. The code appears to be part of a larger system that deals with high-performance calculations, possibly in physics simulations. While it's not directly obvious how this code relates to energy efficiency in a general sense, the underlying theme seems to involve optimizing and correctly managing computational resources, which could be seen as aligning with the goal of minimizing unnecessary computations or resource wastage. Therefore, the content does seem to relate to energy efficiency by focusing on efficient use and optimization of computational resources.","

Support for forward_list and I/O of unordered stl containers.; Support for std::complex. I/O Behavior change. The I/O now properly skip the content of base class onfile that have been removed from the in-memory class layout.; The scheduling the I/O customization rules within a StreamerInfo is now as soon as possible, i.e. after all sources have been read. One significant consequence is that now when an object is stored in a split branch the rule is associtated with the branch of the last of the rule’s sources rather than the last of the object’s data member.; Properly support TStreamerInfo written by ROOT v4.00.; Fix the ordering of the keys in a TFile being written; in particular fixing the result of GetKey and FindKey which were no longer returning the lastest cycle for a TFile being written since v5.34/11. Networking Libraries; HTTP Server; Command Interface; One can now register an arbitrary command to the server, which become visible in the web browser. Then, when the item is clicked by the user, the command ends-up in a gROOT->ProcessLineSync() call.; Custom Properties; Custom properties can be configured for any item in the server.

Using compression, the class name of each same-class object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using a TTree and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned off, you will not see these large savings.; The TTree is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from any other branch. Now, assume that Px and Py are data members of the event, and we would like to compute Px2 + Py2 for every event and histogram the result.; If we had saved the million events without a TTree we would have to:. read each event in its entirety into memory; extract the Px and Py from the event; compute the sum of the squares; fill a histogram. We would have to do that a million times! This is very time consuming, and we really do not need to read the entire event, every time. All we need are two little data members (Px and Py). On the other hand, if we use a tree with one branch containing Px and another branch containing Py, we can read all values of Px and Py by only reading the Px and Py branches. This mak

",True,"The code provided includes several functions related to CUDA device buffers and data handling. These functions seem to be managing resource allocation and optimization on the GPU level. The term 'fNRows' and 'fNCols' likely stand for the number of rows and columns, which are resources being managed by the system. Functions like GetNoElements() calculate the total elements based on rows and columns, which ties into resource use. The InitializeCuda() function suggests setting up device resources properly. Overall, this code appears to be optimizing resource usage on the GPU for better performance, which aligns with energy efficiency as it's minimizing computational resources used while maintaining performance.","

Energy Efficiency," in ROOT. First of all, in order to show better where the clusters on the various axes are, a 1D histogram is associated to each axis. These histograms (one per axis) are filled according to the number of lines passing through the bins. The histogram’s axis can be represented with colors or as bar charts. These histograms can be represented which colors (get from a palette according to the bin contents) or as bar charts. Both representations can be cumulated on the same plot. This technique allows seeing clearly where the clusters are on an individual axis but it does not give any hints about the correlations between the axes.; Avery simple technique allows to make the clusters appearing: Instead of painting solid lines we paint dotted lines. The cluttering of each individual line is reduced and the clusters show clearly as we can see on the next figure. The spacing between the dots is a parameter which can be adjusted in order to get the best results. Using dotted lines is a very simple method to reduce the cluttering. Interactivity is a very important aspect of the Parallel Coordinates plots. To really explore the data set it is essential to act directly with the events and the axes. For instance, changing the axes order may show clusters which were not visible in a different order. On the next figure the axes order has been changed interactively. We can see that many more clusters appear and all the “random spheres” we put in the data set are now clearly visible. Having moved the variables u,v,w after the variables x,y,z the correlation between these two sets of variables is clear also. Axis order is very important to show clusters.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content:  in ROOT. First of all, in order to show better where the clusters on the various axes are, a 1D histogram is associated to each axis. These histograms (one per axis) are filled according to the number of lines passing through the bins. The histogram’s axis can be represented with colors or as bar charts. These histograms can be represented which colors (get from a palette according to the bin contents) or as bar charts. Both representations can be cumulated on the same plot. This technique allows seeing clearly where the clusters are on an individual axis but it does not give any hints about the correlations between the axes.; Avery simple technique allows to make the clusters appearing: Instead of painting solid lines we paint dotted lines. The cluttering of each individual line is reduced and the clusters show clearly as we can see on the next figure. The spacing between the dots is a parameter which can be adjusted in order to get the best results. Using dotted lines is a very simple method to reduce the cluttering. Interactivity is a very important aspect of the Parallel Coordinates plots. To really explore the data set it is essential to act directly with the events and the axes. For instance, changing the axes order may show clusters which were not visible in a different order. On the next figure the axes order has been changed interactively. We can see that many more clusters appear and all the “random spheres” we put in the data set are now clearly visible. Having moved the variables u,v,w after the variables x,y,z the correlation between these two sets of variables is clear also. Axis order is very important to show clusters.

Data:

Content:  level of 1.3 for raw data files and around two on most DST files is the optimum. The choice of one for the default is a compromise between the time it takes to read and write the object vs. the disk space savings.; To specify no compression, set the level to zero.; We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small compared to the total processing time. If the I/O operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it may compress the data by a factor of 10. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression may have a large impact on the program’s performance.; The compression factor, i.e. the savings of disk space, varies with the type of data. A buffer with a same value array is compressed so that the value is only written once. For example, a track has the mass of a pion that it is always the same, and the charge of the pion that is either positive or negative. For 1000 pions, the mass will be written only once, and the charge only twice (positive and negative). When the data is sparse, i.e. when there are many zeros, the compression factor is also high. Compression level; Bytes; Write Time (sec); Read Time (sec.). 0; 1,004,998; 4.77; 0.07. 1; 438,366; 6.67; 0.05. 5; 429,871; 7.03; 0.06. 9; 426,899; 8.47; 0.05. The time to uncompress an object is small compared to the compression time and is independent of the selected compression level. Note that the compression level may be changed at any time, but the new compression level will only apply to newly written objects. Consequently, a ROOT file may contain objects with different compression levels. This table shows four runs of the demo script that creates 15 histograms with different compression parameters. To make the numbers more significant, the macro was modified to create 1000 histograms. We have included two more examples to show the impact of compression on Trees in the next chapter.; 11.6.1 Using the General Open Function of TFile; To

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content:  procedure returns a unique identifier for the; string. This procedure returns a pointer to a new char string corresponding to; the ""string"" argument. The new string has a value identical to string; (strcmp will return 0), but it's guaranteed that any other calls to this; procedure with a string equal to ""string"" will return exactly the same; result (i.e. can compare pointer *values* directly, without having to; call strcmp on what they point to). void ComputeVirtualSize(); Computes virtual size of html area. void ClearGcCache(); Clear the cache of GCs. void ResetLayoutContext(); Reset the main layout context in the main widget. This happens; before we redo the layout, or just before deleting the widget. void Redraw(); This routine is invoked in order to redraw all or part of the HTML; widget. This might happen because the display has changed, or in; response to an expose event. In all cases, though, this routine; is called by an idle handler. void ScheduleRedraw(); Make sure that a call to the Redraw() routine has been queued. Bool_t HandleIdleEvent(TGIdleHandler* i); Handles idle event. void RedrawArea(int left, int top, int right, int bottom); If any part of the screen needs to be redrawn, then call this routine; with the values of a box (in window coordinates) that needs to be; redrawn. This routine will schedule an idle handler to do the redraw. The box coordinates are relative to the clipping window (fCanvas). void DrawRegion(Int_t x, Int_t y, UInt_t w, UInt_t h); Draw region defined by [x,y] [w,h]. Bool_t ItemLayout(); Layout html widget. void RedrawBlock(TGHtmlBlock* p); Redraw the TGHtmlBlock given. void RedrawEverything(); Call this routine to force the entire widget to be redrawn. void RedrawText(int y); Call this routine to cause all of the rendered HTML at the; virtual canvas coordinate of Y and beyond to be redrawn. void HClear(); Erase all data from the HTML widget. Bring it back to an empty screen. Bool_t HandleTimer(TTimer* timer); Handle timer even

5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content includes various function declarations and descriptions that relate to resource management and optimization within the system. The presence of functions like ClearGcCache(), which likely handles memory optimizations, aligns with the attribute's focus on minimizing energy consumption through efficient resource use. Additionally, the Redraw() and ScheduleRedraw() functions indicate controlled redrawing to prevent unnecessary resource usage, further supporting the concept of energy efficiency.","

However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your analysis. For these cases, you can use TTree::MakeClass. It creates a class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand it to do the logic of your analysis.; The TTree::MakeSelector is the recommended method for ROOT data analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor. With MakeClass the user has control over the event loop, with MakeSelectorthe tree is in control of the event loop.; 12.20 Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw; We will use the tree in cernstaff.root that was made by the macro in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/staff.C.; First, open the file and lists it

Content:  that the function resembles the histogram.; That's fitting.; Fitting in Practice; As often with ROOT, you can use a GUI element (the fit panel, available through the menu in ""Tools"", ""Fit Panel"", or on the prompt (TH1::Fit()). Let's use the fit panel!; First, we draw the distribution of the vertex position along X for all muons. Do that into a histogram that has 20 bins and runs from -10 to +10. Now open the fit panel and click the histogram. We want to fit a Gaussian distribution - and hat's already selected by default. Se just press ""Fit"". Looks good, right?; Fit Parameters; As mentioned before, fitting means finding the optimal set of parameters. In the menu, select ""Options"", ""Fit Parameters"" (and resize the statistics box to make its content readable). You will see the values that the minimizer has found optimal, for instance it chose 1.2 as the mean of the Gaussian and 1.041 as the width.; These values are the crucial ones for physicists: they reduce the large amount of data into just a few parameters, describing the distribution even better than the original histogram.

Energy Efficiency," to book all operations *for all RDataFrame computation graphs*; 963before the first event loop is triggered: just-in-time compilation will happen once for all code required to be generated up to that point, also across different computation graphs.; 964 ; 965Also make sure not to count the just-in-time compilation time (which happens once before the event loop and does not depend on the size of the dataset) as part of the event loop runtime (which scales with the size of the dataset). RDataFrame has an experimental logging feature that simplifies measuring the time spent in just-in-time compilation and in the event loop (as well as providing some more interesting information). See [Activating RDataFrame execution logs](\ref rdf-logging).; 966 ; 967### Memory usage; 968 ; 969There are two reasons why RDataFrame may consume more memory than expected. Firstly, each result is duplicated for each worker thread, which e.g. in case of many (possibly multi-dimensional) histograms with fine binning can result in visible memory consumption during the event loop. The thread-local copies of the results are destroyed when the final result is produced. Reducing the number of threads or using coarser binning will reduce the memory usage.; 970 ; 971Secondly, just-in-time compilation of string expressions or non-templated actions (see the previous paragraph) causes Cling, ROOT's C++ interpreter, to allocate some memory for the generated code that is only released at the end of the application.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content:  to book all operations *for all RDataFrame computation graphs*; 963before the first event loop is triggered: just-in-time compilation will happen once for all code required to be generated up to that point, also across different computation graphs.; 964 ; 965Also make sure not to count the just-in-time compilation time (which happens once before the event loop and does not depend on the size of the dataset) as part of the event loop runtime (which scales with the size of the dataset). RDataFrame has an experimental logging feature that simplifies measuring the time spent in just-in-time compilation and in the event loop (as well as providing some more interesting information). See [Activating RDataFrame execution logs](\ref rdf-logging).; 966 ; 967### Memory usage; 968 ; 969There are two reasons why RDataFrame may consume more memory than expected. Firstly, each result is duplicated for each worker thread, which e.g. in case of many (possibly multi-dimensional) histograms with fine binning can result in visible memory consumption during the event loop. The thread-local copies of the results are destroyed when the final result is produced. Reducing the number of threads or using coarser binning will reduce the memory usage.; 970 ; 971Secondly, just-in-time compilation of string expressions or non-templated actions (see the previous paragraph) causes Cling, ROOT's C++ interpreter, to allocate some memory for the generated code that is only released at the end of the application. This commonly results in memory usage creep in long-running applications that create many RDataFrames one after the other.

Energy Efficiency," to the appropriate cells is done when the bin is added to the histogram. To do this, AddBin() calls the AddBinToPartition() method. This method adds the input bin to the partitioning matrix.; The number of partition cells per axis can be specified in the constructor. If it is not specified, the default value of 25 along each axis will be assigned. This value was chosen because it is small enough to avoid slowing down AddBin(), while being large enough to enhance Fill() by a considerable amount. Regardless of how it is initialized at construction time, it can be changed later with the ChangePartition() method. ChangePartition() deletes the old partition matrix and generates a new one with the specified number of cells on each axis.; The optimum number of partition cells per axis changes with the number of times Fill() will be called. Although partitioning greatly speeds up filling, it also adds a constant time delay into the code. When Fill() is to be called many times, it is more efficient to divide the histogram into a large number cells. However, if the histogram is to be filled only a few times, it is better to divide into a small number of cells. ; Definition at line 66 of file TH2Poly.h.

Content:  to the appropriate cells is done when the bin is added to the histogram. To do this, AddBin() calls the AddBinToPartition() method. This method adds the input bin to the partitioning matrix.; The number of partition cells per axis can be specified in the constructor. If it is not specified, the default value of 25 along each axis will be assigned. This value was chosen because it is small enough to avoid slowing down AddBin(), while being large enough to enhance Fill() by a considerable amount. Regardless of how it is initialized at construction time, it can be changed later with the ChangePartition() method. ChangePartition() deletes the old partition matrix and generates a new one with the specified number of cells on each axis.; The optimum number of partition cells per axis changes with the number of times Fill() will be called. Although partitioning greatly speeds up filling, it also adds a constant time delay into the code. When Fill() is to be called many times, it is more efficient to divide the histogram into a large number cells. However, if the histogram is to be filled only a few times, it is better to divide into a small number of cells. ; Definition at line 66 of file TH2Poly.h.

1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided code snippets from a matrix library discuss various operations like matrix multiplication, transposition, and similarity transforms. While these are low-level operations, they contribute to efficient resource use in computations. By optimizing how matrices are manipulated, the system avoids unnecessary computations, thus minimizing energy consumption. Therefore, this content accurately reflects energy efficiency by showing optimized resource usage in matrix operations.","
