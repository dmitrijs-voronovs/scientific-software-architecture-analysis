Content: While looking into other stuff yesterday, I think I came across the code that throws this error. If I understood correctly, this happens if you have a static ASan library linked into the executable (as we do for ROOT binaries) and then load a shared runtime library, for example via `LD_PRELOAD`. So what we likely have to do in here is figuring out if `LD_PRELOAD` is maybe set too aggressively and actually not needed / hurting for the tests listed above.

",True,"The provided content includes compiler warnings and test failure reports. These relate to issues within the software's implementation and testing processes. Testability refers to the ease of validation through testing, which includes both successful tests (which this isn't directly about) and failed ones that indicate areas needing attention. While the focus here is on fixing the deprecated function and resolving test failures rather than ensuring testability itself, there's a connection between addressing these issues and maintaining or improving testability over time. Thus, it's a true positive in the context of ensuring overall software quality and testability.","

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content consists of compiler warnings related to variable shadowing. These are static code analysis issues that help in finding potential bugs by ensuring variables are uniquely named and avoid conflicts.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,The content links to various test results and indicates that specific tests are failing. This directly relates to Testability as it highlights issues in validating software functionality through testing.,"
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses failing tests, which are related to code-level issues and test results, rather than software architecture concepts."
