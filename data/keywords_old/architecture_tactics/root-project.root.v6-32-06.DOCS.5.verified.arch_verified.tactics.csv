Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Deployability,"This directory contains a VSPackage project to generate a Visual Studio extension; for clang-format. Build prerequisites are:; - Visual Studio 2015; - Extensions SDK (you'll be prompted to install it if you open ClangFormat.sln). The extension is built using CMake to generate the usual LLVM.sln by setting; the following CMake vars:. - BUILD_CLANG_FORMAT_VS_PLUGIN=ON. - NUGET_EXE_DIR=path/to/nuget_dir (unless nuget.exe is already available in PATH). example:; cd /d C:\code\llvm; mkdir build & cd build; cmake -DBUILD_CLANG_FORMAT_VS_PLUGIN=ON -DNUGET_EXE_DIR=C:\nuget .. Once LLVM.sln is generated, build the clang_format_vsix target, which will build; ClangFormat.sln, the C# extension application. The CMake build will copy clang-format.exe and LICENSE.TXT into the ClangFormat/; directory so they can be bundled with the plug-in, as well as creating; ClangFormat/source.extension.vsixmanifest. Once the plug-in has been built with; CMake once, it can be built manually from the ClangFormat.sln solution in Visual; Studio. ===========; Debugging; ===========. Once you've built the clang_format_vsix project from LLVM.sln at least once,; open ClangFormat.sln in Visual Studio, then:. - Make sure the ""Debug"" target is selected; - Open the ClangFormat project properties; - Select the Debug tab; - Set ""Start external program:"" to where your devenv.exe is installed.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided appears to be a segment of a CMakeLists.txt file, which is used for compiling software and managing build configurations. The lines contain instructions for installing different sets of files into specific directories, such as ${header_install_dir}. Each line specifies a set of files (e.g., arm_only_generated_files) along with their destination directory and whether they should be excluded from the all target. These commands are likely part of the deployment process, specifically related to copying necessary files into the installation directory before deployment. The mention of components like 'arm-resource-headers', 'aarch64-resource-headers', etc., suggests that these are resource headers for different architectures being built and installed. This aligns with Deployability as it involves getting all required resources correctly deployed in the operational environment. Additionally, there is no presence of logs or log-related text; it's purely build configuration. Therefore, this content accurately relates to Deployability by showing how files are being installed and configured for deployment, ensuring that the software can be deployed predictably with minimal effort.","

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Deployability,"binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools.

Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing architecture tactics in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to categorize text according to software architecture tactics, quality attributes, and responses.

Given a piece of text related to software architecture, your task is to:
1. Identify the specific tactic being described
2. Provide a clear ""response"" which in the context of software architecture refers to the activity undertaken by the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) as a result of the arrival of a stimulus

Analyze the following text:
control of the thread pool.; That means that RDataFrame uses a separate data source for every thread, each of the data sources runs in sequential mode. ### Concurrent Readers; Multiple readers can read the same RNTuple concurrently as long as access to every individual reader is sequential. ### Parallel REntry Preparation; Multiple `REntry` object can be concurrently prepared by multiple threads.; I.e., construction and binding of the objects can happen in parallel.; The actual reading and writing of entries (`RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`, `RNTupleWriter::Fill()`) needs to be protected by a mutex.; This is considered ""mild scalability parallelization"" in RNTuple. ### RNTupleParallelWriter; The parallel writer offers the most scalable parallel writing interface.; Multiple _fill contexts_ can concurrently serialize and compress data.; Every fill context prepares a set of entire clusters in the final on-disk layout.; When a fill context flushes data,; a brief serialization point handles the RNTuple meta-data updates and the reservation of disk space to write into. Low precision float types; --------------------------; RNTuple supports encoding floating point types with a lower precision when writing them to disk. This encoding is specified by the; user per field and it is independent on the in-memory type used for that field (meaning both a `RField<double>` or `RField<float>` can; be mapped to e.g. a low-precision 16 bit float). RNTuple supports the following encodings (all mutually exclusive):. - **Real16**/**SplitReal16**: IEEE-754 half precision float. Set by calling `RField::SetHalfPrecision()`;; - **Real32Trunc**: floating point with less than 32 bits of precision (truncated mantissa).; Set by calling `RField::SetTruncated(n)`, with $10 <= n <= 31$ equal to the total number of bits used on disk.; Note that `SetTruncated(16)` makes this effectively a `bfloat16` on disk;; - **Real32Quant**: floating point with a normalized/quantized integer representation on disk usin

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing architecture tactics in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to categorize text according to software architecture tactics, quality attributes, and responses.

Given a piece of text related to software architecture, your task is to:
1. Identify the specific tactic being described
2. Provide a clear ""response"" which in the context of software architecture refers to the activity undertaken by the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) as a result of the arrival of a stimulus

Analyze the following text:
ction which both calls the original target of the call, returns; its result, and returns updated values for any live pointers to; garbage collected objects. Note that the task of identifying all live pointers to garbage; collected values, transforming the IR to expose a pointer giving the; base object for every such live pointer, and inserting all the; intrinsics correctly is explicitly out of scope for this document.; The recommended approach is to use the :ref:`utility passes; <statepoint-utilities>` described below. This abstract function call is concretely represented by a sequence of; intrinsic calls known collectively as a ""statepoint relocation sequence"". Let's consider a simple call in LLVM IR:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; call void ()* @foo(); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj; }. Depending on our language we may need to allow a safepoint during the execution; of ``foo``. If so, we need to let the collector update local values in the; current frame. If we don't, we'll be accessing a potential invalid reference; once we eventually return from the call. In this example, we need to relocate the SSA value ``%obj``. Since we can't; actually change the value in the SSA value ``%obj``, we need to introduce a new; SSA value ``%obj.relocated`` which represents the potentially changed value of; ``%obj`` after the safepoint and update any following uses appropriately. The; resulting relocation sequence is:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; %0 = call token (i64, i32, void ()*, i32, i32, ...)* @llvm.experimental.gc.statepoint.p0f_isVoidf(i64 0, i32 0, void ()* @foo, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); %obj.relocated = call coldcc i8 addrspace(1)* @llvm.experimental.gc.relocate.p1i8(token %0, i32 7, i32 7); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj.relocated; }. Ideally, this sequence would have been represented as a M argument, N; ret

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing architecture tactics in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to categorize text according to software architecture tactics, quality attributes, and responses.

Given a piece of text related to software architecture, your task is to:
1. Identify the specific tactic being described
2. Provide a clear ""response"" which in the context of software architecture refers to the activity undertaken by the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) as a result of the arrival of a stimulus

Analyze the following text:

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Analyze the following text:
d run and check the; history, before allowing the commit being pushed [statuschecks]_.; However this solution would be somewhat fragile (how do you update a script; installed on every developer machine?) and prevents SVN access to the; repository. What About Commit Emails?; -------------------------. We will need a new bot to send emails for each commit. This proposal leaves the; email format unchanged besides the commit URL. Straw Man Migration Plan; ========================. Step #1 : Before The Move; -------------------------. 1. Update docs to mention the move, so people are aware of what is going on.; 2. Set up a read-only version of the GitHub project, mirroring our current SVN; repository.; 3. Add the required bots to implement the commit emails, as well as the; umbrella repository update (if the multirepo is selected) or the read-only; Git views for the sub-projects (if the monorepo is selected). Step #2 : Git Move; ------------------. 4. Update the buildbots to pick up updates and commits from the GitHub; repository. Not all bots have to migrate at this point, but it'll help; provide infrastructure testing.; 5. Update Phabricator to pick up commits from the GitHub repository.; 6. LNT and llvmlab have to be updated: they rely on unique monotonically; increasing integer across branch [MatthewsRevNum]_.; 7.

Until this point nothing has changed for developers, it will just; boil down to a lot of work for buildbot and other infrastructure; owners. The migration will pause here until all dependencies have cleared, and all; problems have been solved. Step #3: Write Access Move; --------------------------. 9. Collect developers' GitHub account information, and add them to the project.; 10. Switch the SVN repository to read-only and allow pushes to the GitHub repository.; 11. Update the documentation.; 12.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

In the drop-down Action list, which defaults to ""Comment,"" you should; select ""Abandon Revision"" and then enter a comment explaining why. Click the; Submit button to finish closing the review. Status; ------. Please let us know whether you like it and what could be improved! We're still; working on setting up a bug tracker, but you can email klimek-at-google-dot-com; and chandlerc-at-gmail-dot-com and CC the llvm-dev mailing list with questions; until then. We also could use help implementing improvements. This sadly is; really painful and hard because the Phabricator codebase is in PHP and not as; testable as you might like. However, we've put exactly what we're deploying up; on an `llvm-reviews GitHub project`_ where folks can hack on it and post pull; requests. We're looking into what the right long-term hosting for this is, but; note that it is a derivative of an existing open source project, and so not; trivially a good fit for an official LLVM project. .. _LLVM's Phabricator: https://reviews.llvm.org; .. _`https://reviews.llvm.org`: https://reviews.llvm.org; .. _Code Repository Browser: https://reviews.llvm.org/diffusion/; .. _Arcanist Quick Start: https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist_quick_start/; .. _Arcanist User Guide: https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist/; .. _llvm-reviews GitHub project: https://github.com/r4nt/llvm-reviews/; 

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.
