Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing architecture tactics in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to categorize text according to software architecture tactics, quality attributes, and responses.

Given a piece of text related to software architecture, your task is to:
1. Identify the specific tactic being described
2. Provide a clear ""response"" which in the context of software architecture refers to the activity undertaken by the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) as a result of the arrival of a stimulus

ROOT; » ROOFIT; » ROOSTATS; » RooStats::NeymanConstruction. class RooStats::NeymanConstruction: public RooStats::IntervalCalculator. NeymanConstruction is a concrete implementation of the NeymanConstruction interface that, as the name suggests,; performs a NeymanConstruction. ; It produces a RooStats::PointSetInterval, which is a concrete implementation of the ConfInterval interface. . The Neyman Construction is not a uniquely defined statistical technique, it requires that one specify an ordering rule ; or ordering principle, which is usually incoded by choosing a specific test statistic and limits of integration ; (corresponding to upper/lower/central limits). As a result, this class must be configured with the corresponding; information before it can produce an interval. Common configurations, such as the Feldman-Cousins approach, can be ; enforced by other light weight classes. The Neyman Construction considers every point in the parameter space independently, no assumptions are ; made that the interval is connected or of a particular shape. As a result, the PointSetInterval class is used to ; represent the result. The user indicate which points in the parameter space to perform the constrution by providing; a PointSetInterval instance with the desired points.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing architecture tactics in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to categorize text according to software architecture tactics, quality attributes, and responses.

Given a piece of text related to software architecture, your task is to:
1. Identify the specific tactic being described
2. Provide a clear ""response"" which in the context of software architecture refers to the activity undertaken by the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) as a result of the arrival of a stimulus

Analyze the following text:
. TEfficiency(const TH1& passed, const TH1& total); constructor using two existing histograms as input. Input: passed - contains the events fullfilling some criteria; total - contains all investigated events. Notes: - both histograms have to fullfill the conditions of CheckConsistency; - dimension of the resulating efficiency object depends; on the dimension of the given histograms; - Clones of both histograms are stored internally; - The function SetName(total.GetName() + ""_clone"") is called to set; the names of the new object and the internal histograms..; - The created TEfficiency object is NOT appended to a directory.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.
