You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

If the; # results are concordant (i.e., the genotype predicted by the marginal; # likelihood for each variant is the same as the genotype predicted when; # maximizing the joint likelihood across all variants), we return variants; # with those calls and the rescaled likelihoods. Otherwise, we log a warning; # and emit the original (incompatible) variants.; #; # For example, a biallelic deletion with probabilities of homref, het, homalt; # = 0.01, 0.9, 0.09 and inside it a biallelic SNP with probs 0.02, 0.48, 0.5.; # Naively this would be called as a heterozygous indel and a homozygous SNP,; # which is impossible as there are three total alternate genotypes.

For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?
