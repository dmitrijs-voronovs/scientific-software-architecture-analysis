The `make_examples` program is where the gVCF records are computed. One additional flag is required in `make_examples`, the `--gvcf <filename>`; flag. This specifies an additional output, which is a TFRecord file of Variant; protocol buffers. If running with multiple processes, the sharding applied to; this output filename must be the same as that applied to the `--examples`; output.

When run in gVCF mode, the `postprocess_variants` program handles the creation; of the final gVCF file that incorporates both the non-variant records and the; true variants discovered by the previous programs. Two additional flags are required in `postprocess_variants`, the input; `--nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path <filename>` which corresponds to the TFRecord; of Variant protocol buffers created in `make_examples`, and the output; `--gvcf_outfile <filename>` which is the final gVCF output.

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``.

By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

NOTE: gVCF outputs are only valid when `make_examples` is run in ""calling"" mode;; if attempted to run in ""training"" mode the program will exit and notify the user; of the error. ### `postprocess_variants`. When run in gVCF mode, the `postprocess_variants` program handles the creation; of the final gVCF file that incorporates both the non-variant records and the; true variants discovered by the previous programs. Two additional flags are required in `postprocess_variants`, the input; `--nonvariant_site_tfrecord_path <filename>` which corresponds to the TFRecord; of Variant protocol buffers created in `make_examples`, and the output; `--gvcf_outfile <filename>` which is the final gVCF output.

For the models we've released over time, you can find more details about the; training data in; [DeepVariant training data](deepvariant-details-training-data.md). ## CRAM support. As of v0.7, DeepVariant accepts CRAM files as input in addition to BAM files. As of v0.9.0, we changed the default to use the reference file specified by the; `--ref` flag, instead of the path to the original reference in the CRAM file; (encoded in the file's ""UR"" tag). For more information about CRAM, see the; [`samtools` documentation](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) in general; but particularly the sections on; [Global Options](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#GLOBAL_OPTIONS) and; [reference sequences in CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#REFERENCE_SEQUENCES). `htslib` also hosts a nice page; [benchmarking CRAM](http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/CRAM.html) with information; on the effect of different CRAM options on file size and encoding/decoding; performance. Here are some basic file size and runtime numbers for running a single; `make_examples` job on a 30x whole genome sample in BAM and CRAM format. Filetype | Size (Gb) | Runtime (min); -------- | --------- | -------------; BAM | 66.99 | 79m47.37307s; CRAM | 37.85 | 96m53.477s; Ratio | 56.50% | 121.43%. * BAM file:; `gs://deepvariant/performance-testdata/HG002_NIST_150bp_downsampled_30x.bam`; * CRAM file:; `gs://deepvariant/performance-testdata/HG002_NIST_150bp_downsampled_30x.cram`. Runtime was measured on; [n1-standard-64](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#n1_machine_types); machines. ## Starting from v1.2.0, we include `samtools` and `bcftools`. Based on user feedback ([GitHub issue #414](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/414)),; we added samtools and bcftools in our Docker image:. ```bas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory.

When using the one-step `run_deepvariant` script, supply a `--logging_dir`; directory and set `--runtime_report`. For example, when following the; [quick start](deepvariant-quick-start.md), including `--runtime_report; --logging_dir=/output/logs` would produce the following runtime profiling output; file and visual report:. ```; /output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region/make_examples_runtime-00000-of-00001.tsv; /output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region_report.html; ```. ### Running stages individually. If you are using make_examples itself without the run_deepvariant script, supply; make_examples with `--runtime_by_region=` a filename (.tsv). If the examples are; sharded then the runtime profile should be sharded into the same number of; shards, e.g. when using `examples@64` then runtimes could be `runtimes@64.tsv`. Then use the `runtime_by_region_vis` script to create a visual report of the; make_examples runtime by region data.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: The content only consists of logs and no other text.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: The content only consists of logs and no other text.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

### Example 6
**Content:** is relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages

If needed, DeepTrio can be built from source. For more details please refer to; [Building DeeepTrio](deeptrio-build-test.md). ## DeepTrio Input assumptions. The reference genome FASTA, passed in using the `--ref` flag, must be indexed; and can either be uncompressed or compressed with `bgzip`. All BAM files should be aligned to a ""compatible"" version of the genome; reference provided as the `--ref`. DeepTrio will only process contigs shared by; both the BAM and reference.

In our analyses, there is almost no difference in accuracy with and; without duplicate marking except at lower (<20x) coverages. Finally, we; recommend that you do not perform BQSR. Running BQSR has a small decrease on; accuracy. If you are providing `--regions` or other similar arguments, these should refer; to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21. ## Training data.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

**Content to evaluate:**  
eepVariant v0.9 release, we recommend; ""[Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md)"". For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced; [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md); in v1.1. ## Why am I seeing ""CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error"" while running on GPU?. We have been observing the following message while running on GPU since we moved; platform from slim to keras:. ```bash; 2023-10-20 22:21:03.818638: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```. We; have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So; you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. ## How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models?. 16GB. In our test, we observe the model occupying 16GB GPU memory. ## Do models from before r1.6.0 work with current inference code?. No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in; Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. ## Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs?. No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU; inference yet. ## Can model_train be run on multiple GPUs?. No. TensorFlow's Estimator API does provide support for running training on; multiple GPUs through the use of a DistributionStrategy. However,; DistributionStrategy cannot be used with exponential moving average (EMA), which; is present in the DeepVariant codebase. ## What is the realigner and how does it work?. From the; [DeepVariant 2018 manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235.epdf?author_access_token=q4ZmzqvvcGBqTuKyKgYrQ9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NuM3saQzpZk8yexjfPUhdFj4zyaA4Yvq0LWBoCYQ4B9vqPuv8e2HHy4vShDgEs8YxI_hLs9ov6Y1f_4fyS7kGZ):. > Mapped reads are

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``.

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

Testability,"effectively haploid. So, we are introducing two; flags to re-adjust the genotypes in regions that are considered to be haploid; for those samples. You can use `--haploid_contigs` and `--par_regions_bed` parameters to readjust; the genotypes in haploid regions. For samples with XY karyotype, it is expected; that users will set `--haploid_contigs=""chrX,chrY""` for; [GRCh38](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fa); and `--haploid_contigs=""X,Y""` for; [GRCh37](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepvariant/case-study-testdata/hs37d5.fa).; You can also provide a PAR region bed file with; `--par_regions_bed=""/input/GRCh3X_par.bed""` parameter.

The genotype re-adjustment is implemented in the `postprocess_variants` stage of; DeepVariant. For any variant, that is in the`--haploid_contigs` regions and; **not** in the `--par_regions_bed` regions, the genotype likelihoods of; heterozygous variants are set as 0 and the genotypes are normalized again after; re-adjusting the likelihoods. After that the most-likely genotype is assigned to; the allele which excludes any heterozygous calls. For example, suppose we observe an alternate allele `ALT1` at a position that we; consider to be haploid. So the observed alleles at that position are:; `Candidates: {REF, ALT1}` The neural network generates likelihoods for the; genotypes for this candidate as such:. ```; Homozygous reference: likelihood(REF,REF); Heterozygous alternate: likelihood(REF,ALT1); Homozygous alternaate: likelihood(ALT1,ALT1); ```.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

Since the DeepVariant v0.9 release, we recommend; ""[Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md)"". For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced; [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md); in v1.1. ## Why am I seeing ""CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error"" while running on GPU?. We have been observing the following message while running on GPU since we moved; platform from slim to keras:. ```bash; 2023-10-20 22:21:03.818638: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```. We; have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So; you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. ## How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models?. 16GB. In our test, we observe the model occupying 16GB GPU memory. ## Do models from before r1.6.0 work with current inference code?. No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in; Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. ## Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs?. No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU; inference yet. ## Can model_train be run on multiple GPUs?. No. TensorFlow's Estimator API does provide support for running training on; multiple GPUs through the use of a DistributionStrategy. However,; DistributionStrategy cannot be used with exponential moving average (EMA), which; is present in the DeepVariant codebase. ## What is the realigner and how does it work?.

hat your home directory is first.; ls $HOME; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1""; sudo docker run \; -v ""${HOME}"":""${HOME}"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; ls $HOME; ```. ## How do I run multi-sample calling?. Since the DeepVariant v0.9 release, we recommend; ""[Best practices for multi-sample variant calling with DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/trio-merge-case-study.md)"". For specifically calling on duos or trios, we introduced; [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deeptrio-details.md); in v1.1. ## Why am I seeing ""CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error"" while running on GPU?. We have been observing the following message while running on GPU since we moved; platform from slim to keras:. ```bash; 2023-10-20 22:21:03.818638: E tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:1278] could not retrieve CUDA device count: CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: initialization error; ```. We; have tested and confirmed that this does not affect GPU usage or inference. So; you can continue running DeepVariant without being worried about this message. ## How much GPU memory is needed for the Keras models?. 16GB. In our test, we observe the model occupying 16GB GPU memory. ## Do models from before r1.6.0 work with current inference code?. No. We have moved from Slim to Keras. All models before `1.6.0` were trained in; Slim platform. So they are not compatible with `1.6.0` anymore. ## Can call_variants be run on multiple GPUs?. No. Although possible, we have not implemented the multi-GPU capability in GPU; inference yet. ## Can model_train be run on multiple GPUs?. No. TensorFlow's Estimator API does provide support for running training on; multiple GPUs through the use of a DistributionStrategy. However,; DistributionStrategy cannot be used with exponential moving average (EMA), which; is present in the DeepVariant codebase. ## What is the realigner and how does it work?. From the; [DeepVariant 2018 manuscript](
",True,"The content includes multiple questions and answers related to Docker, GPU usage, model compatibility, and running on multiple GPUs. This information is intended for users looking to run DeepVariant with specific configurations. It does not contain any sensitive or internal data.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros.

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around.

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

Testability,"rio. ## Background. To get started, we've provided a Docker image, and some test data in a bucket on; Google Cloud Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data; through the corresponding public URLs. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepTrio in one command. Although DeepTrio can be built from a source, we provide a docker image that; allows to run through all steps in one command to generate VCF/gVCF output files; from input BAM files and the reference. If you want to compile the binaries for yourself, we also have a [Dockerfile]; that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the [docker build]; documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. For each sample, one aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its; corresponding index file (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a; sequencing instrument, using an aligner like [BWA] for example.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: The content only consists of logs and no other text.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

rio. ## Background. To get started, we've provided a Docker image, and some test data in a bucket on; Google Cloud Storage. The instructions below show how to download the data; through the corresponding public URLs. This setup requires a machine with the AVX instruction set. To see if your; machine meets this requirement, you can check the `/proc/cpuinfo` file, which; lists this information under ""flags"". If you do not have the necessary; instructions, see the next section for more information on how to build your own; Docker image. ### Use Docker to run DeepTrio in one command. Although DeepTrio can be built from a source, we provide a docker image that; allows to run through all steps in one command to generate VCF/gVCF output files; from input BAM files and the reference. If you want to compile the binaries for yourself, we also have a [Dockerfile]; that you can use to build your own Docker image. You can read the [docker build]; documentation on how to build. ## Get Docker image, models, and test data. ### Get Docker image. ```bash; BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". sudo apt -y update; sudo apt-get -y install docker.io; sudo docker pull google/deepvariant:deeptrio-""${BIN_VERSION}""; ```. ### Download test data. Before you start, you need to have the following input files:. 1. A reference genome in [FASTA] format and its corresponding index file; (.fai). 1. For each sample, one aligned reads file in [BAM] format and its; corresponding index file (.bai). You get this by aligning the reads from a; sequencing instrument, using an aligner like [BWA] for example.

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

NOTE: all parameters below are used as an example. They are not optimized for; this dataset, and are not recommended as the best default either. ```bash; ( time sudo docker run --gpus 1 \; -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \; -w /home/${USER} \; ${DOCKER_IMAGE}-gpu \; train \; --config=dv_config.py:base \; --config.train_dataset_pbtxt=""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/training_set.dataset_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.tune_dataset_pbtxt=""${OUTPUT_DIR}/validation_set.dataset_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.init_checkpoint=gs://deepvariant/models/DeepVariant/1.6.1/checkpoints/wgs/deepvariant.wgs.ckpt \; --config.num_epochs=10 \; --config.learning_rate=0.0001 \; --config.num_validation_examples=0 \; --experiment_dir=${TRAINING_DIR} \; --strategy=mirrored \; --config.batch_size=512 \; ) > ""${LOG_DIR}/train.log"" 2>&1 &; ```. Once training starts, you should see a summary of your training dataset:. ```; Training Examples: 342758; Batch Size: 512; Epochs: 10; Steps per epoch: 669; Steps per tune: 116; Num train steps: 6690; ```. As training runs, the validation/tune dataset will be evaluated at the end of; each epoch, and every n training steps specified by `--config.tune_every_steps`.; You can lower `--config.tune_every_steps` to perform evaluation more frequently. Checkpoints are stored whenever the `tune/f1_weighted` metric improves when; evaluating the tune dataset. In this way, the last checkpoint stored will always; be the best performing checkpoint. The best performing checkpoint metric can be; configured using `--config.best_checkpoint_metric`. We have tested training with 1 and 2 GPUs and observed the following runtimes:. n GPUs | Time; ------ | ----------; 1 | 89m39.451s; 2 | 54m8.163s.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros.

The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/183837/testReport/projectroot/test/test_stressgraphics_interpreted/)
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: The content only consists of logs and no other text.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format. This can be; useful when the value itself is not useful, for instance:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK-NOT: mov r0, r[[#]]. to check that a value is synthesized rather than moved around. The syntax of a numeric substitution is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]]`` where:. * ``<fmtspec>`` is the same format specifier as for defining a variable but; in this context indicating how a numeric expression value should be matched; against. If absent, both components of the format specifier are inferred from; the matching format of the numeric variable(s) used by the expression; constraint if any, and defaults to ``%u`` if no numeric variable is used,; denoting that the value should be unsigned with no leading zeros. In case of; conflict between format specifiers of several numeric variables, the; conversion specifier becomes mandatory but the precision specifier remains; optional. * ``<constraint>`` is the constraint de

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures. It might be beneficial to add more comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations. @DevTeam, could we discuss implementing a more robust testing framework for this?
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: The content contains meaningful human-written sentences in natural language

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

### Example 6
**Content:** is relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

## Eliminate content that consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or samples (e.g., `if/else`, brackets, keywords)
- Program logs or error messages (timestamps, error codes, stack traces)
- API documentation or technical specifications
- Configuration files or build output
- Version control metadata or system messages
- Compiler/interpreter output

## Keep content that contains:
- Complete, meaningful sentences in natural language
- Explanatory or descriptive content
- Human-written prose discussing concepts, decisions, or ideas

However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?
