The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module. These can be accessed through the get_variable() function.; For example, after performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the; spin component scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made; available:; e_mp2=get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by clean().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the last will; include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and FCI; TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a; high-quality calculation cheaply. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files.

The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, PSI4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; PSI4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Sec. Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

For; example,; set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri. or. basis {; assign cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2; computations. To assign the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI to carbon atoms, the following; command is used:; basis {; assign C aug-cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and; Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate; auxiliary basis set automatically according to Auxiliary Basis Sets,; unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the; input. Finally, we note that the basis {...} block may also be used; for defining basis sets, as detailed in Sec. User-Defined Basis Sets. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 Gb. memory 2000 Mb. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 Gb.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis. Note; For parallel jobs, the memory keyword represents the total memory; available to the job, not the memory per thread.

To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H2; and H atom:; molecule h2{; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h{; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module. These can be accessed through the get_variable() function.; For example, after performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the; spin component scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made; available:; e_mp2=get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by clean().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the last will; include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and FCI; TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a; high-quality calculation cheaply. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets=[""cc-pVDZ"",""cc-pVTZ"",""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf').

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter. Ordering of irreducible representations (irreps) used in PSI4.

For example, water ( symmetry) has 3 doubly occupied ; orbitals, as well as 1 each of and symmetry; the; corresponding DOCC array is therefore:; DOCC = [3, 0, 1, 1]. Although PSI4 will detect the symmetry automatically, and use the largest; possible Abelian subgroup, the user might want to run in a lower point group.; To do this the symmetry keyword can be used when inputting the molecule; (see Sec. Molecule and Geometry Specification). In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with symmetry in , the; axis can be chosen as either the , the , or the ; these can; be specified by requesing the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the , , and planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, PSI4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; freque",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html

We use a snippet from the mints2 sample; input file, which performs a benzene SCF computation, to demonstrate this; feature.; basis {; assign DZ; assign C 3-21G; assign H1 sto-3g; assign C1 sto-3g; }. The first line in this block assigns the DZ basis set to all atoms. The next; line then assigns 3-21G to all carbon atoms, leaving the hydrogens with the DZ; basis set. On the third line, the hydrogen atoms which have been specifically; labelled as H1 are given the STO-3G basis set, leaving the unlabelled hydrogen; atoms with the DZ basis set. Likewise, the fourth line assigns the STO-3G; basis set to just the carbon atoms labelled C1. This bizzare example was; constructed to demonstrate the syntax, but the flexibility of the basis set; specification is advantageous, for example, when selectivily omitting diffuse; functions to make computations more tractable.; In the above example the basis sets have been assigned asymmetrically, reducing; the effective symmetry from to ; PSI4 will detect this; automatically and run in the appropriate point group. The same syntax can be; used to specify basis sets other than that used to define orbitals. For; example,; set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri. or. basis {; assign cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2; computations. To assign the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI to carbon atoms, the following; command is used:; basis {; assign C aug-cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and; Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate; auxiliary basis set automatically according to Auxiliary Basis Sets,; unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the; input.

Return Values and PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results of; each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H2; and H atom:; molecule h2{; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h{; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module. These can be accessed through the get_variable() function.; For example, after performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the; spin component scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made; available:; e_mp2=get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by clean().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the last will; include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and FCI; TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a; high-quality calculation cheaply. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets=[""cc-pVDZ""",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html

The declaration of basis_set is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H1 R; H1 R2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(102,106,2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(100,102,2). table=Table(rows=[""R"",""A""], cols=[""E(SCF)"",""E(SCS)"",""E(DFMP2)""]). set basis cc-pvdz. for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('df-mp2'); escf = get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); edfmp2 = get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); escsmp2 = get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); table[R][A] = [escf, escsmp2, edfmp2]. print table; relative=table.copy(); relative.absolute_to_relative(); print relative. we first define a table (on line 10) with two row indices and three column; indices.

Job Control¶; PSI4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file, detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module, which; control its function. The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/psithoninput.html

The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module. These can be accessed through the get_variable() function.; For example, after performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the; spin component scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made; available:; e_mp2=get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by clean().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the last will; include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and FCI; TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a; high-quality calculation cheaply. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets=[""cc-pVDZ"",""cc-pVTZ"",""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_set is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans.

Defining a Method Alias¶; Since quantum chemical methods in PSI4 are accessed through Python functions, and; most important quantities are available as PSI variables, it is straightforward; to create aliases to commonly run calculations or to define hybrid methods. The; psi4/lib/python/aliases.py file is intended for editing by the user for; this purpose.; As an example, the MP2.5 method is the average of MP2 and MP3. The latter is; available through the arbitrary order MPn code and returns all lower energies; along with it in PSI variables. The following is basic code that will compute; and return the MP2.5 energy.; def run_mp2_5(name, **kwargs):. energy('mp3', **kwargs); e_scf = psi4.get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); ce_mp2 = psi4.get_variable('MP2 CORRELATION ENERGY'); ce_mp3 = psi4.get_variable('MP3 CORRELATION ENERGY'). ce_mp25 = 0.5 * (ce_mp2 + ce_mp3); e_mp25 = e_scf + ce_mp25. print """""" MP2.5 total energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (e_mp25); print """""" MP2.5 correlation energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (ce_mp25). return e_mp25.

Note; No recompile of the PSI program is necessary for changes made to; files in $PSIDATADIR aka psi4/lib, including those described below. Defining a Method Alias¶; Since quantum chemical methods in PSI4 are accessed through Python functions, and; most important quantities are available as PSI variables, it is straightforward; to create aliases to commonly run calculations or to define hybrid methods. The; psi4/lib/python/aliases.py file is intended for editing by the user for; this purpose.; As an example, the MP2.5 method is the average of MP2 and MP3. The latter is; available through the arbitrary order MPn code and returns all lower energies; along with it in PSI variables. The following is basic code that will compute; and return the MP2.5 energy.; def run_mp2_5(name, **kwargs):. energy('mp3', **kwargs); e_scf = psi4.get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); ce_mp2 = psi4.get_variable('MP2 CORRELATION ENERGY'); ce_mp3 = psi4.get_variable('MP3 CORRELATION ENERGY'). ce_mp25 = 0.5 * (ce_mp2 + ce_mp3); e_mp25 = e_scf + ce_mp25. print """""" MP2.5 total energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (e_mp25); print """""" MP2.5 correlation energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (ce_mp25). return e_mp25. Compare the above to the method that resides in psi4/lib/python/aliases.py.; The rationale for the changes is indicated in the comments below.; def run_mp2_5(name, **kwargs):; lowername = name.lower() # handy variable with name keyword in lowercase; kwargs = kwargs_lower(kwargs) # removes case sensitivity in keyword names. # Run detci calculation and collect conventional quantities; energy('mp3', **kwargs); e_scf = psi4.get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); ce_mp2 = psi4.get_variable('MP2 CORRELATION ENERGY'); ce_mp3 = psi4.get_variable('MP3 CORRELATION ENERGY'); e_mp2 = e_scf + ce_mp2 # reform mp2 and mp3 total energies for printing; e_mp3 = e_sc",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/quickaddalias.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/quickaddalias.html

A reaction is a combination of one or more; reagent energies whose value you are interested in and a reference value; for which you may or may not be in possession of. A few examples follow.; In a database of interaction energies, the reagents are dimers and their; component monomers (usually derived from the dimer geometry), and the; reactions are the dimer less monomers energies. In a database of barrier; heights, the reagents are reactants, products, and transition-state; structures, and the reactions are the transition-states less; minimum-energy structures. Possibly you may have a collection of; structures to simply be acted upon in parallel, in which case the; structures are both the reagents and the reactions. The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. Prepare geometry files; Assemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won’t allow them. If you’re determined to; have dashes and dots, they must be replaced by other characters in the; process_input line, then translated back in the GEOS section; see; NBC10.py for an examp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/quickadddatabase.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/quickadddatabase.html

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; PSI4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, . The monomer Fock operators, , are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of , , and .; Through first-order in , electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in .

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; PSI4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, . The monomer Fock operators, , are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of , , and .; Through first-order in , electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in .

The; individual terms are grouped according to the component of the interaction; to which they contribute. The total component energies (i.e.,; electrostatics, exchange, induction, and dispersion) represent what we; regard as the best estimate available at a given level of SAPT computed; from a subset of the terms of that grouping. The groupings shown above are; not unique and are certainly not rigorously defined. We regard the groupings; used in PSI4 as a “chemist’s grouping” as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms; (i.e. , , etc. in; the exchange component. A final note is that both Disp22(T); and Est.Disp22(T) results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The Disp22(T); result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis;; Est.Disp22(T) is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space.

These results are for the water dimer geometry shown above computed with; SAPT0/aug-cc-pVDZ. Monomer-Centered Basis Computations¶; The charge-transfer analysis above is carried out by taking the; difference between SAPT induction as calculated in the dimer-centered; basis (i.e., each monomer sees the basis functions on both monomers); vs. the monomer-centered basis (i.e., each monomer utilizes only its; own basis set). It is also possible to run a SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer').

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; PSI4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, . The monomer Fock operators, , are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of , , and .; Through first-order in , electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in .

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; PSI4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format. Use a Cartesian representation; to avoid this problem. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, . The monomer Fock operators, , are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of , , and .; Through first-order in , electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in . For; a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent; review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887].; Several truncations of the SAPT expansion are available in the SAPT; module of PSI4.

The; individual terms are grouped according to the component of the interaction; to which they contribute. The total component energies (i.e.,; electrostatics, exchange, induction, and dispersion) represent what we; regard as the best estimate available at a given level of SAPT computed; from a subset of the terms of that grouping. The groupings shown above are; not unique and are certainly not rigorously defined. We regard the groupings; used in PSI4 as a “chemist’s grouping” as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms; (i.e. , , etc. in; the exchange component. A final note is that both Disp22(T); and Est.Disp22(T) results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The Disp22(T); result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis;; Est.Disp22(T) is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space.

These results are for the water dimer geometry shown above computed with; SAPT0/aug-cc-pVDZ. Monomer-Centered Basis Computations¶; The charge-transfer analysis above is carried out by taking the; difference between SAPT induction as calculated in the dimer-centered; basis (i.e., each monomer sees the basis functions on both monomers); vs. the monomer-centered basis (i.e., each monomer utilizes only its; own basis set). It is also possible to run a SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set.

During the SCF procedure, the occupation of orbitals is typically determined by; the Aufbau principal across all spatial symmetries. This may result in the; occupation shifting between iterations.

Broken Symmetry¶; For certain problems, such diradicals, allowing the spin-up and spin-down orbitals to differ in closed-shell computations can be advantageous; this is known as symmetry breaking. The resulting wavefunction will often provide superior energetics, due to the increased flexibility, but will suffer non-physicical spin contamination from higher multiplicity states. PSI4 can compute a high-spin triplet wavefunction and then use this as a guess for the broken-symmetry low spin state. To do this, you request broken symmetry in the energy() call, using one of the following::; energy('uhf', brokensymmetry=True). or, equivalently. set reference uhf; energy('scf', brokensymmetry=True). Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL.

For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.

Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/scf-1.html

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is already quite flexible and powerful, with new features being; added weekly. We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your primary basis/atom type. Then use; DIRECT.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

The first set of iterations are from the DF portion of the computation, the; second set use the exact (but much slower) PK algorithm. Within the DF portion; of the computation, the zeroth-iteration uses a non-idempotent density matrix; obtained from the SAD guess, so the energy is unphysically low.

During the SCF procedure, the occupation of orbitals is typically determined by; the Aufbau principal across all spatial symmetries. This may result in the; occupation shifting between iterations. If the occupations are known a priori,; they may be clamped throughout the procedure by using the DOCC and; SOCC options. For instance, all good quantum chemists know that; water is; actually,:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set {; docc [3,0,1,1] # 1A1 2A1 1B1 3A1 1B2; basis cc-pvdz; }. energy('scf'). Broken Symmetry¶; For certain problems, such diradicals, allowing the spin-up and spin-down orbitals to differ in closed-shell computations can be advantageous; this is known as symmetry breaking. The resulting wavefunction will often provide superior energetics, due to the increased flexibility, but will suffer non-physicical spin contamination from higher multiplicity states. PSI4 can compute a high-spin triplet wavefunction and then use this as a guess for the broken-symmetry low spin state. To do this, you request broken symmetry in the energy() call, using one of the following::; energy('uhf', brokensymmetry=True). or, equivalently. set reference uhf; energy('scf', brokensymmetry=True). Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis.

Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs).

This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option.

In this example, there are 287 AO basis functions after spherical harmonics are; applied. These are used to produce 287 symmetry adapted USOs, 145 of which are; assigned to irrep A, and 142 of which are assigned to irrep B. Within irrep A,; 144 OSOs fall above the eigenvalue cutoff, and within irrep B 140 OSOs fall; above the eigenvalue cutoff. In total, 284 molecular orbitals are chosen from; 287 AOs/USOs. The table also shows the initial assignment of electrons to; irreps. Initial Guess/Convergence Stabilization¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. CORE [Default]; Diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems. READ becomes the default for the second and later iterations; of geometry optimizations.; SAD; Superposition of Atomic Densities.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL.

For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxilia",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/scf.html

When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems.

In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via the options detailed below.; MOM [Off by Default]; MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from an one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations , invoking; MOM_START can often rescue the convergence of the SCF.

This mixing, known as “damping” can be activated by setting; the DAMPING_PERCENTAGE keyword to a nonzero percent.

For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree-Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/scf.html

This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. CORE [Default]; Diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems. READ becomes the default for the second and later iterations; of geometry optimizations.; SAD; Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems.; GWH; Generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, a simple Huckel-Theory-like method based on; the overlap and core Hamiltonian matrices. May be useful in open-shell systems.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a checkpoint file, casting from one basis to; another if needed. Useful for starting anion computations from neutral; orbitals, or after small geometry changes. At present, casting from a; different molecular point group is not supported. This becomes the; default for the second and later iterations of geometry optimizations. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; BASIS_GUESS = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness. An example of performing an RHF solution of water by SAD guessing; in a 3-21G basis and then casting up to cc-pVTZ is shown below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/scf.html

[7](1, 2, 3) For frequency computations by finite difference of energies,; convergence criteria are tightened further still to 10 for; E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE for SCF of HF or DFT, 11; for E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE for SCF of post-HF,; and 10 for E_CONVERGENCE for post-HF of post-HF. Recommendations¶; The SCF code is already quite flexible and powerful, with new features being; added weekly. We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your primary basis/atom type. Then use; DIRECT.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.24; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z mass; O 0.000 0.000 -0.270 15.994915; H 0.000 0.418 0.538 1.007825; H 0.000 -0.418 0.538 1.007825. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers. Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy with Psithon¶; Finally, let’s consider an example that shows how the Python driver; in PSI4 simplifies some routine tasks. PSI4 can interpret; valid Python code in addition to the computational chemistry directives; we’ve seen in the previous examples; we call this mixture Psithon.; The Python computer language is very easy to pick up, and even users; previously unfamiliar with Python can use it to simplify tasks by; modifying some of the example input files supplied with PSI4; in the psi4/samples directory.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0]",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial-1.html

But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables ( and ), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.24; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z mass; O 0.000 0.000 -0.270 15.994915; H 0.000 0.418 0.538 1.007825; H 0.000 -0.418 0.538 1.007825. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Notice the loop over to create; the table looks just like the loop over R to run the different; computations, and the CP-corrected energies ecp[R] are accessed the same; way they were stored. The print line at the end just specifies some; formatting for the printed table (first element is a floating point number 3; spaces wide with one digit after the decimal, and the second element is a; floating point number 10 spaces wide with 6 digits after the decimal); the; format strings are the same as in the C programming language. For tables more; complicated than the simple one used here, Psithon has built-in support for; tables (see the next section).; The following section goes over Psithon in much more detail, but; hopefully this example already makes it clear that many complex tasks; can be done very easily in PSI4.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation. Looking at the output from running the; previous example, we see that the OH bond length is about 0.9463 Ångstroms,; and the bond angle is about 104.575 degrees. It’s good to give this many; digits (or more) to make sure there’s not significant roundoff error in the; geometry when running a frequency computation. So, our frequency; computation input (which can be found as test case; tu4-h2o-freq) is:; #! Frequencies for H2O HF/cc-pVDZ at optimized geometry. memory 250 mb. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.9463; H 1 0.9463 2 104.575; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set scf_type pk; frequencies('scf'). Alternatively, it’s also possible for PSI4 to use Cartesian coordinate; input. Here, the Cartesian coordinates of the optimized geometry can be; extracted from the bottom of the optimization output. The input; would then look like this:; molecule h2o {; O 0.0000000000 0.0000000000 -0.0647163165; H 0.0000000000 -0.7490459647 0.5135474533; H 0.0000000000 0.7490459647 0.5135474533; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; frequencies('scf').

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }. Here’s the second half of the input, where we specify the computation; options:; set {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0'). Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set or set globals; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial-1.html

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

For your convenience, this example can be found in; tu1-h2o-energy.; You can run it if you wish.; Once PSI4 is in your path (see the User Configuration; section of the installation instructions), you can run this computation by typing; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat.

Compiling and Installing).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule).

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0.00077279 0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial.html

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation. Looking at the output from running the; previous example, we see that the OH bond length is about 0.9463 Ångstroms,; and the bond angle is about 104.575 degrees. It’s good to give this many; digits (or more) to make sure there’s not significant roundoff error in the; geometry when running a frequency computation. So, our frequency; computation input (which can be found as test case; tu4-h2o-freq) is:; #!

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set or set globals; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10].

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0]. set basis aug-cc-pVDZ; set freeze_core True. # Initialize a blank dictionary of counterpoise corrected energies; # (Need this for the syntax below to work); ecp = {}. for R in Rvals:; dimer.R = R; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'). psi4.print_out(""\n""); psi4.print_out(""CP-corrected CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energies\n\n""); psi4.print_out("" R (Ang) E_int (kcal/mol) \n""); psi4.print_out(""-----------------------------------------------------\n""); for R in Rvals:; e = ecp[R] * 627.5095; psi4.print_out("" %3.1f %10.6f\n"" % (R, e)). First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other.

That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (subtracting any ”.in” or ”.dat” suffix),; plus a ”.out” suffix.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Notice the loop over to create; the table looks just like the loop over R to run the different; computations, and the CP-corrected energies ecp[R] are accessed the same; way they were stored.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec.

PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

This; call knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer; computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis. The; various energy components are printed at the end of the output, in addition; to the total SAPT0 interaction energy. An explanation of the various; energy components can be found in the review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and; Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887], and this is discussed in more detail; in the SAPT section later in this manual. For now, we’ll note that most of; the SAPT energy components are negative; this means those are attractive; contributions (the zero of energy in a SAPT computation is defined as; non-interacting monomers). The exchange contributions are positive; (repulsive). In this example, the most attractive contribution between; ethylene and acetylene is an electrostatic term of -2.12 kcal mol-1; (Elst10,r where the 1 indicates the first-order; perturbation theory result with respect to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/tutorial.html

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers.

Test Suite¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading. CTest and pytest, PSIthon and PsiAPI¶; In designing a test, sometimes you want it to be a model input for the user in a single file or you don’t want a lot of psi4. or Python syntax cluttering the input.; In this case, follow Adding PSIthon Test Cases to prepare as PSIthon (psi4 input.dat) for, roughly speaking, running through ctest.; The PSIthon/CTest test suite occupies the whole of psi4/tests except psi4/tests/pytests.; At other times you want the test to check several variations of a template job or you want to test error handling or you want to focus on PsiAPI rather than PSIthon or you want to control the compute conditions with environment variables.; In this case, follow Adding PsiAPI Test Cases to prepare as PsiAPI (import psi4) for, roughly speaking, running through pytest.; The PsiAPI/pytest test suite occupies psi4/tests/pytests.; The above description sounds as if there are two disjoint test suites, and",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/add_tests.html

Test Suite¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading. CTest and pytest, PSIthon and PsiAPI¶; In designing a test, sometimes you want it to be a model input for the user in a single file or you don’t want a lot of psi4. or Python syntax cluttering the input.; In this case, follow Adding PSIthon Test Cases to prepare as PSIthon (psi4 input.dat) for, roughly speaking, running through ctest.; The PSIthon/CTest test suite occupies the whole of psi4/tests except psi4/tests/pytests.; At other times you want the test to check several variations of a template job or you want to test error handling or you want to focus on PsiAPI rather than PSIthon or you want to control the compute conditions with environment variables.; In this case, follow Adding PsiAPI Test Cases to prepare as PsiAPI (import psi4) for, roughly speaking, running through pytest.; The PsiAPI/pytest test suite occupies psi4/tests/",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/add_tests.html

Test Contents¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter it’s asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure. Deep down, they’re NumPy functions.; In preparing the test case reference values, aim for the converged value rather than many digits from your computer under default convergence conditions.; This will make the test more robust for different OS, different BLAS libraries, and variations in SC",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/add_tests.html

A function in psi4/tests/pytests/conftest.py does this automatically between every test.; Especially if using data or functions from outside a test, run a variety of tests at different pytest -n <N> levels to mix up test ordering.

Test Contents¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter it’s asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure. Deep down, they’re NumPy functions.; In prep",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/add_tests.html

If you see labels to add or rename, please do.; A test requiring over 15 minutes should be labeled longtests. A short test under 30 seconds used for general bug checking should be labeled quicktests. A test that confirms PSI4 is operational should be labeled smoketests.; If a test needs extra input files like grid.dat or extra reference files for checking against, like fchk, specify these in the CMakeLists.txt as shown above. Such tests must be run through ctest and don’t usually work when run “by hand” from the objdir via stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/directory_name/input.dat.; If a test is multiple minutes long, load-balancing a parallel CTest run requires the test to be started early. Use the COST line as shown above to set a weighting to about the number of seconds the test takes. input.dat¶; The other necessary file is the input file itself, input.dat.
