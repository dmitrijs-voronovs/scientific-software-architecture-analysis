https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0:998,Availability,avail,available,998,"# QuTiP 5.0.0 . QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``,; ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations,; and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used; consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been; substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to; represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer; and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced.; In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators``; specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have; had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to; easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know.; A notebook to help with migration is available on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18TcuHNQifYSHdGey7otK8IPDB1YbDZpW?usp=sharing). . An extensive list of changes follows. ## Contributors. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``. Other members of the QuTiP Admin team have been heavily involved in reviewing,; testing and designing QuTiP 5:. - Alexander Pitchford; - Asier Galicia; - Nathan Shammah; - Shahnawaz Ahmed; - Neill Lambert; - Simon Cross; - Paul Menczel. Two Google Summer of Code contributors updated the tutorials and benchmarks to; QuTiP 5:. - Christian Staufenbiel updated many of the [tutorials](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tutorials).; - Xavier Sproken update the [benchmarks](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-ben",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0

Previously ``Qobj`` data was stored in a SciPy-like sparse matrix. Now the; representation is flexible. Implementations for dense and sparse formats are; included in QuTiP and custom implementations are possible. QuTiP's performance; on dense states and operators is significantly improved as a result. Some highlights:. - The data is still acessible via the ``.data`` attribute, but is now an; instance of the underlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix.; The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``,; regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other; operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type; to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and; ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype``; parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product.; ``bar @ ket`` returns a scalar.; - The new ``.contract()`` method will collapse 1D subspaces of the dimensions of; the ``Qobj``.; - The new ``.logm()`` method returns the matrix logarithm of an operator.; - The methods ``.set_data``, ``.get_data``,",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0

Use ``sec_cutoff=-1`` instead.; - The required tolerance is now read from ``qutip.settings``. ### Krylov Subspace Solver (krylovsolve):. - The Krylov solver is now implemented using ``SESolver`` and the ``krylov``; ODE integrator. The function ``krylovsolve`` is maintained for convenience; and now supports many more options.; - The ``sparse`` parameter has been removed. Supply a sparse ``Qobj`` for the; Hamiltonian instead. ### Floquet Solver (fsesolve and fmmesolve):. - The Floquet solver has been rewritten to use a new ``FloquetBasis`` class; which manages the transformations from lab to Floquet basis and back.; - Many of the internal methods used by the old Floquet solvers have; been removed. The Floquet tensor may still be retried using; the function ``floquet_tensor``.; - The Floquet Markov Master Equation solver has had many changes and; new options added. The environment temperature may be specified using; ``w_th``, and the result states are stored in the lab basis and optionally; in the Floquet basis using ``store_floquet_state``.; ",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0

QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``,; ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations,; and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used; consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been; substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to; represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer; and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced.; In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators``; specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have; had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to; easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know.; A notebook to help with migration is available on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18TcuHNQifYSHdGey7otK8IPDB1YbDZpW?usp=sharing). . An extensive list of changes follows. ## Contributors. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years.

QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``,; ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations,; and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used; consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been; substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to; represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer; and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced.; In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators``; specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have; had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to; easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know.; A notebook to help with migration is available on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18TcuHNQifYSHdGey7otK8IPDB1YbDZpW?usp=sharing). . An extensive list of changes follows. ## Contributors. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years.

Qobj changes; ------------. Previously ``Qobj`` data was stored in a SciPy-like sparse matrix. Now the representation is flexible. Implementations for dense and sparse formats are included in QuTiP and custom implementations are possible. QuTiP's performance on dense states and operators is significantly improved as a result. Some highlights:. - The data is still acessible via the ``.data`` attribute, but is now an instance of the underlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix. The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``, regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype`` parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product. ``bar @ ket`` returns a scalar.; - The new ``.contract()`` method will collapse 1D subspaces of the dimensions of the ``Qobj``.; - The new ``.logm()`` method returns the matrix logarithm of an operator.; - The methods ``.set_data``, ``.get_data``, ``.extr",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1

All solvers:. - Solver options are now supplied in an ordinary Python dict. ``qutip.Options`` is deprecated and returns a dict for backwards compatibility.; - A specific ODE integrator may be selected by supplying a ``method`` option.; - Each solver provides a class interface. Creating an instance of the class allows a solver to be run multiple times for the same system without having to repeatedly reconstruct the right-hand side of the ODE to be integrated.; - A ``QobjEvo`` instance is accepted for most operators, e.g., ``H``, ``c_ops``, ``e_ops``, ``a_ops``.; - The progress bar is now selected using the ``progress_bar`` option. A new progess bar using the ``tqdm`` Python library is provided.; - Dynamic arguments, where the value of an operator depends on the current state of the evolution, have been removed.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1:16,Deployability,release,release,16,"**This is a pre-release.**. QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``, ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations, and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years.

The time-dependent coefficients are now represented using a new ``Coefficient`` type that may be independently created and manipulated if required. Some highlights:. - The ``.compile()`` method has been removed. Coefficients specified as strings are automatically compiled if possible and the compilation is cached across different Python runs and instances.; - Mixing coefficient types within a single ``Qobj`` is now supported.; - Many new attributes were added to ``QobjEvo`` for convenience. Examples include ``.dims``, ``.shape``, ``.superrep`` and ``.isconstant``.; - Many old attributes such as ``.cte``, ``.use_cython``, ``.type``, ``.const``, and ``.coeff_file`` were removed.; - A new ``Spline`` coefficient supports spline interpolations of different orders. The old ``Cubic_Spline`` coefficient has been removed.; - The new ``.arguments(...)`` method allows additional arguments to the underlying coefficient functions to be updated.; - The ``_step_func_coeff`` argument has been replaced by the ``order`` parameter. ``_step_func_coeff=False`` is equivalent to ``order=3``. ``_step_func_coeff=True`` is equivalent to ``order=0``. Higher values of ``order`` gives spline interpolations of higher orders. Solver changes; --------------. The solvers in QuTiP have been heavily reworked and standardized. Under the hood solvers now make use of swappable ODE ``Integrators``. Many ``Integrators`` are included (see the list below) and custom implementations are possible. Solvers now consistently accept a ``QobjEvo`` instance at the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian, or any object which can be passed to the ``QobjEvo`` constructor. A breakdown of highlights follows.

QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``, ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations, and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years.

Qobj changes; ------------. Previously ``Qobj`` data was stored in a SciPy-like sparse matrix. Now the representation is flexible. Implementations for dense and sparse formats are included in QuTiP and custom implementations are possible. QuTiP's performance on dense states and operators is significantly improved as a result. Some highlights:. - The data is still acessible via the ``.data`` attribute, but is now an instance of the underlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix. The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``, regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype`` parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; ",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1

Qobj changes; ------------. Previously ``Qobj`` data was stored in a SciPy-like sparse matrix. Now the representation is flexible. Implementations for dense and sparse formats are included in QuTiP and custom implementations are possible. QuTiP's performance on dense states and operators is significantly improved as a result. Some highlights:. - The data is still acessible via the ``.data`` attribute, but is now an instance of the underlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix. The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``, regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype`` parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product. ``bar @ ket`` returns a s",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1

The time-dependent coefficients are now represented using a new ``Coefficient`` type that may be independently created and manipulated if required. Some highlights:. - The ``.compile()`` method has been removed. Coefficients specified as strings are automatically compiled if possible and the compilation is cached across different Python runs and instances.; - Mixing coefficient types within a single ``Qobj`` is now supported.; - Many new attributes were added to ``QobjEvo`` for convenience. Examples include ``.dims``, ``.shape``, ``.superrep`` and ``.isconstant``.; - Many old attributes such as ``.cte``, ``.use_cython``, ``.type``, ``.const``, and ``.coeff_file`` were removed.; - A new ``Spline`` coefficient supports spline interpolations of different orders. The old ``Cubic_Spline`` coefficient has been removed.; - The new ``.arguments(...)`` method allows additional arguments to the underlying coefficient functions to be updated.; - The ``_step_func_coeff`` argument has been replaced by the ``order`` parameter. ``_step_func_coeff=False`` is equivalent to ``order=3``. ``_step_func_coeff=True`` is equivalent to ``order=0``.

QobjEvo changes; ---------------. The ``QobjEvo`` type for storing time-dependent quantum objects has been significantly expanded, standardized and extended. The time-dependent coefficients are now represented using a new ``Coefficient`` type that may be independently created and manipulated if required. Some highlights:. - The ``.compile()`` method has been removed. Coefficients specified as strings are automatically compiled if possible and the compilation is cached across different Python runs and instances.; - Mixing coefficient types within a single ``Qobj`` is now supported.; - Many new attributes were added to ``QobjEvo`` for convenience.

The ``precompute`` option to ``FloquetBasis`` may be used instead. Evolution of State Solver (essovle):. - The function ``essolve`` has been removed. Use the ``diag`` integration method with ``sesolve`` or ``mesolve`` instead. Steady-state solvers (steadystate module):. - The ``method`` parameter and ``solver`` parameters have been separated. Previously they were mixed together in the ``method`` parameter.; - The previous options are now passed as parameters to the steady state solver and mostly passed through to the underlying SciPy functions.; - The logging and statistics have been removed. Correlation functions (correlation module):. - A new ``correlation_3op`` function has been added. It supports ``MESolver`` or ``BRMESolver``.; - The ``correlation``, ``correlation_4op``, and ``correlation_ss`` functions have been removed.; - Support for calculating correlation with ``mcsolve`` has been removed.

Under the hood solvers now make use of swappable ODE ``Integrators``. Many ``Integrators`` are included (see the list below) and custom implementations are possible. Solvers now consistently accept a ``QobjEvo`` instance at the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian, or any object which can be passed to the ``QobjEvo`` constructor. A breakdown of highlights follows. All solvers:. - Solver options are now supplied in an ordinary Python dict. ``qutip.Options`` is deprecated and returns a dict for backwards compatibility.; - A specific ODE integrator may be selected by supplying a ``method`` option.; - Each solver provides a class interface. Creating an instance of the class allows a solver to be run multiple times for the same system without having to repeatedly reconstruct the right-hand side of the ODE to be integrated.; - A ``QobjEvo`` instance is accepted for most operators, e.g., ``H``, ``c_ops``, ``e_ops``, ``a_ops``.; - The progress bar is now selected using the ``progress_bar`` option. A new progess bar using the ``tqdm`` Python library is provided.; - Dynamic arguments, where the value of an operator depends on the current state of the evolution, have been removed. They may be re-implemented later if there is demand for them. Integrators:. - The SciPy zvode integrator is available with the BDF and Adams methods as ``bdf`` and ``adams``.; - The SciPy dop853 integrator (an eighth order Runge-Kutta method by Dormand & Prince) is available as ``dop853``.; - The SciPy lsoda integrator is available as ``lsoda``.; - QuTiP's own implementation of Verner's ""most efficient"" Runge-Kutta methods of order 7 and 9 are available as ``vern7`` and ``vern9``. See http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/ for a description of the methods.; - QuTiP's own implementation of a solver that directly diagonalizes the the system to be integrated is available as ``diag``.

It only works on time-independent systems and is slow to setup, but once the diagonalization is complete, it generates solutions very quickly.; - QuTiP's own implementatoin of an approximate Krylov subspace integrator is available as ``krylov``. This integrator is only usable with ``sesolve``. Result class:. - A new ``.e_data`` attribute provides expectation values as a dictionary. Unlike ``.expect``, the values are provided in a Python list rather than a numpy array, which better supports non-numeric types.; - The contents of the ``.stats`` attribute changed significantly and is now more consistent across solvers. Monte-Carlo Solver (mcsolve):. - The system, H, may now be a super-operator.; - The ``seed`` parameter now supports supplying numpy ``SeedSequence`` or ``Generator`` types.; - The new ``timeout`` and ``target_tol`` parameters allow the solver to exit early if a timeout or target tolerance is reached.; - The ntraj option no longer supports a list of numbers of trajectories. Instead, just run the solver multiple times and use the class ``MCSolver`` if setting up the solver uses a significant amount of time.; - The ``map_func`` parameter has been replaced by the ``map`` option.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v4.7.0:604,Performance,load,loading,604,"This release sees the addition of two new solvers -- `qutip.krylovsolve` based on the Krylov subspace approximation and `qutip.nonmarkov.heom` that reimplements the BoFiN HEOM solver. Bloch sphere rendering gained support for drawing arcs and lines on the sphere, and for setting the transparency of rendered points and vectors, Hinton plots gained support for specifying a coloring style, and matrix histograms gained better default colors and more flexible styling options. Other significant improvements include better scaling of the Floquet solver, support for passing `Path` objects when saving and loading files, support for passing callable functions as `e_ops` to `mesolve` and `sesolve`, and faster state number enumeration and Husimi Q functions. Import bugfixes include some bugs affecting plotting with matplotlib 3.5 and fixing support for qutrits (and other non-qubit) quantum circuits. The many other small improvements, bug fixes, documentation enhancements, and behind the scenese development changes are included in the list below. QuTiP 4.7.X will be the last series of releases for QuTiP 4. Patch releases will continue for the 4.7.X series but the main development effort will move to QuTiP 5. The many, many contributors who filed issues, submitted or reviewed pull requests, and improved the documentation for this release are listed next to their contributions below. Thank you to all of you. # Improvements. - **MAJOR** Added krylovsolve as a new solver based on krylov subspace approximation.

The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes.

The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes. Improvements; ------------; - The ``enr_destroy`` function was made ~200x faster in many simple cases. ([#1593](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1593) by Johannes Feist); - The ``state_number_enumerate`` function was made significantly faster. ([#1594](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1594) by Johannes Feist); - Added the missing drift Hamiltonian to the method run_analytically of ``Processor``. ([#1603](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1603) Boxi Li); - The ``hadamard_transform`` was made much faster, e.g., ~70x faster for N=10. ([#1688](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1688) by Asier Galicia); - Added support for computing the power of a scalar-like Qobj. ([#1692](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1692) by Asier Galicia); - Removed the ``hardware_info`` module. This module wasn't used inside QuTiP and regularly broke when new operating systems were released, and in particular prevented importing QuTiP on the Apple M1.
