Interesting that you also experimented with making the full RooAbsMinimizer templated. I agree that making the RooAbsMinimizer a templated class is not the best solution, but I still think we can even avoid the templated constructor, making the code more clear and reducing compile time/binary size.

You would not even have to check for the `logic_error`, because with the enum class is is ensured that the value is either `classic` or `gradient`. You would just need a little helper struct to make the `RooMinimizer::create()` function work, something to translate from the function class to the FcnMode:. ```C++; class RooMinimizer { ; ; ... ; private: ; ; template <typename MinimizerFcn ; struct GetFcnMode { ; static const FcnMode value = FcnMode::classic; ; }; ; ; ... ; ; } ; ; ; template<> ; struct RooMinimizer::GetFcnMode<RooGradMinimizerFcn> { ; static const FcnMode value = FcnMode::gradient; ; }; ; ; ; // static function ; template <typename MinimizerFcn> ; std::unique_ptr<RooMinimizer> RooMinimizer::create(RooAbsReal &function) { ; return std::make_unique<RooMinimizer>(function, GetFcnMode<MinimizerFcn>::value); ; } ; ```.

I'm wondering whether we even still need the templated create function if we do it like this. I have to check my notes, but I think I introduced that just because working with templated constructors is very awkward (you have to pass your desired template class as a regular parameter (I think the cheapest way to do so is a nullptr of the desired type, which explains the `MinimizerFcn* /* value unused */` argument in the constructor)). The issue will return, though, with the upcoming third `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` derived class. We could in principle solve it in a similar way, by using an `enum class`. The big downside of this is that every time someone wants to implement a new likelihood/gradient calculator class they would have to also modify the enum class and the corresponding RooMinimizer code that redirects to the proper calculator constructors and such. Anyway, I'm sure we will discuss this in the upcoming PR. Edit: so yeah, I think at least for this overload of `create`, we could also just add a `FcnMode` argument and lose the template. The `create` for the upcoming class will be a different overload anyway, so we can just keep these ones template free and would only need template for that stuff (maybe, unless enum class).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596#issuecomment-879791307

Sorry, I was completely wrong with the origin of the problem. The original issue came from wrapper functions generated by `TClingCallFunc`, which in turn ends up triggering warnings when used by cppyy/PyROOT. The way to go is to supress `-Wunused-result` diagnostics only for `TClingCallFunc` wrapper functions.

Those are just those people who contributed to that version, but generally don't include earlier authors. Can we use ""ROOT team"" as author? Or should we take everyone from `README/CREDITS`? Or should we skip it, at the cost of a lack of (computer-) identifiable attributions?; - we want people who dislike using Zenodo to [cite the paper](https://github.com/root-project/root/#cite). Actually, very few cite Zenodo. How do we embed that paper in `CITATION.cff`, with [references](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/README.md#references-optional)? What does the BibTeX file looks like for that?.
