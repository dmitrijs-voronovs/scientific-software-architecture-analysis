Same as the [base correction feature](#base-correction-for-pe-data), this function is also based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time.

This setting is useful for trimming the tails having `polyX (i.e. polyA) ` before `polyG`. `polyG` is usually caused by sequencing artifacts, while `polyA` can be commonly found from the tails of mRNA-Seq reads. # unique molecular identifier (UMI) processing; UMI is useful for duplication elimination and error correction based on generating consensus of reads originated from a same DNA fragment. It's usually used in deep sequencing applications like ctDNA sequencing. Commonly for Illumina platforms, UMIs can be integrated in two different places: `index` or head of `read`.  ; To enable UMI processing, you have to enable `-U` or `--umi` option in the command line, and specify `--umi_loc` to specify the UMI location, it can be one of:; * `index1` the first index is used as UMI. If the data is PE, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.; * `index2` the second index is used as UMI. PE data only, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.; * `read1` the head of read1 is used as UMI.

If `--umi_loc` is specified with `read1`, `read2` or `per_read`, the length of UMI should specified with `--umi_len`. `fastp` will extract the UMIs, and append t",MatchSource.DOCS,README.md,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md

This function is not enabled by default, specify `-c` or `--correction` to enable it. This function is based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # global trimming; `fastp` supports global trimming, which means trim all reads in the front or the tail.

The splitting can work with two different modes: `by limiting file number` or `by limiting lines of each file`. These two modes cannot be enabled together.  . The file names of these split files will have a sequential number prefix, adding to the original file name specified by `--out1` or `--out2`, and the width of the prefix is controlled by the `-d` or `--split_prefix_digits` option. For example, `--split_prefix_digits=4`, `--out1=out.fq`, `--split=3`, then the output files will be `0001.out.fq`,`0002.out.fq`,`0003.out.fq`. ## splitting by limiting file number; Use `-s` or `--split` to specify how many files you want to have. `fastp` evaluates the read number of a FASTQ by reading its first ~1M reads. This evaluation is not accurate so the file sizes of the last several files can be a little differnt (a bit bigger or smaller). For best performance, it is suggested to specify the file number to be a multiple of the thread number. ## splitting by limiting the lines of each file; Use `-S` or `--split_by_lines` to limit the lines of each file. The last files may have smaller sizes since usually the input file cannot be perfectly divided. The actual file lines may be a little greater than the value specified by `--split_by_lines` since `fastp` reads and writes data by blocks (a block = 1000 reads). # overrepresented sequence analysis; Overrepresented sequence analysis is disabled by default, you can specify `-p` or `--overrepresentation_analysis` to enable it. For consideration of speed and memory, `fastp` only counts sequences with length of 10bp, 20bp, 40bp, 100bp or (cycles - 2 ). By default, fastp uses 1/20 reads for sequence counting, and you can change this settings by specifying `-P` or `--overrepresentation_sampling` option. For example, if you set `-P 100`, only 1/100 reads will be used for counting, and if you set `-P 1`, all reads will be used but it w",MatchSource.DOCS,README.md,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md

This function is based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # global trimming; `fastp` supports global trimming, which means trim all reads in the front or the tail. This function is useful since sometimes you want to drop some cycles of a sequencing run. For example, the last cycle of Illumina sequencing is uaually with low quality, and it can be dropped with `-t 1` or `--trim_tail1=1` option. * For read1 or SE data, the front/tail trimming settings are given with `-f, --trim_front1` and `-t, --trim_tail1`.; * For read2 of PE data, the front/tail trimming settings are given with `-F, --trim_front2` and `-T, --trim_tail2`. But if these options are not specified, they will be as same as read1 options, which means `trim_front2 = trim_front1` and `trim_tail2 = trim_tail1`.; * If you want to trim the reads to maximum length, you can specify `-b, --max_len1` for read1, and `",MatchSource.DOCS,README.md,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md

For consideration of speed and memory, `fastp` only counts sequences with length of 10bp, 20bp, 40bp, 100bp or (cycles - 2 ). By default, fastp uses 1/20 reads for sequence counting, and you can change this settings by specifying `-P` or `--overrepresentation_sampling` option. For example, if you set `-P 100`, only 1/100 reads will be used for counting, and if you set `-P 1`, all reads will be used but it will be extremely slow. The default value 20 is a balance of speed and accuracy. `fastp` not only gives the counts of overrepresented sequence, but also gives the information that how they distribute over cycles. A figure is provided for each detected overrepresented sequence, from which you can know where this sequence is mostly found. # merge paired-end reads; For paired-end (PE) input, fastp supports stiching them by specifying the `-m/--merge` option.

So you will get a single output file. This option is disabled by default. `--failed_out` can still be given to store the reads (either merged or unmerged) failed to passing filters. In the output file, a tag like `merged_xxx_yyy`will be added to each read name to indicate that how many base pairs are from read1 and from read2, respectively. For example, `; @NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15`; means that 150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2. `fastp` prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2. Same as the [base correction feature](#base-correction-for-pe-data), this function is also based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation.
