CFI will be generated that defines the CFA as the unswizzled address; relative to the wave scratch base in the unswizzled private address space; of the lowest address stack allocated local variable. ``DW_AT_frame_base`` will be defined as the swizzled address in the; swizzled private address space by dividing the CFA by the wavefront size; (since CFA is always at least dword aligned which matches the scratch; swizzle element size).

Function argument passing is implemented by copying the input physical; registers to virtual registers on entry. The register allocator can spill if; necessary. These are copied back to physical registers at call sites. The; net effect is that each function call can have these values in entirely; distinct locations. The IPRA can help avoid shuffling argument registers.; 6. Call sites are implemented by setting up the arguments at positive offsets; from SP.

A global address space address has the same value when used as a flat address; so no conversion is needed. **Global and Constant**; The global and constant address spaces both use global virtual addresses,; which are the same virtual address space used by the CPU.

The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated; of volatile data before each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant; memory to change values between kernel dispatches. **Region**; The region address space uses the hardware Global Data Store (GDS).

Kernel Dispatch; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The HSA architected queuing language (AQL) defines a user space memory interface; that can be used to control the dispatch of kernels, in an agent independent; way. An agent can have zero or more AQL queues created for it using an HSA; compatible runtime (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`), in which AQL packets (all of which; are 64 bytes) can be placed. See the *HSA Platform System Architecture; Specification* [HSA]_ for the AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts. The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.; It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded; by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is; associated.; 3.

The HSA compatible; runtime api uses 64-bit atomic operations to reserve space in the AQL queue; for the packet. The packet must be set up, and the final write must use an; atomic store release to set the packet kind to ensure the packet contents are; visible to the kernel agent. AQL defines a doorbell signal mechanism to; notify the kernel agent that the AQL queue has been updated. These rules, and; the layout of the AQL queue and kernel dispatch packet is defined in the *HSA; System Architecture Specification* [HSA]_.; 6. A kernel dispatch packet includes information about the actual dispatch,; such as grid and work-group size, together with information from the code; object about the kernel, such as segment sizes. The HSA compatible runtime; queries on the kernel symbol can be used to obtain the code object values; which are recorded in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata`.; 7. CP executes micro-code and is responsible for detecting and setting up the; GPU to execute the wavefronts of a kernel dispatch.; 8. CP ensures that when the a wavefront starts executing the kernel machine; code, the scalar general purpose registers (SGPR) and vector general purpose; registers (VGPR) are set up as required by the machine code. The required; setup is defined in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`. The initial; register state is defined in; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`.; 9. The prolog of the kernel machine code (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog`) sets up the machine state as necessary; before continuing executing the machine code that corresponds to the kernel.; 10. When the kernel dispatch has completed execution, CP signals the completion; signal specified in the kernel dispatch packet if not 0. .. _amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces:. Memory Spaces; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

The; ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of the; memory location description. In AMDGPU expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used by the; ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute expression where divergent control flow is; controlled by the execution mask. An undefined location description together; with ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` is used to indicate the lane was not active on entry; to the subprogram. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc` for an example. Debugger Information Entry Attributes; -------------------------------------.

For AMDGPU, the Common Information Entry (CIE) fields have the following values:. 1. ``augmentation`` string contains the following null-terminated UTF-8 string:. ::. [amd:v0.0]. The ``vX.Y`` specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU; extensions used in this CIE or to the FDEs that use it. The version number; conforms to [SEMVER]_. 2. ``address_size`` for the ``Global`` address space is defined in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`. 3. ``segment_selector_size`` is 0 as AMDGPU does not use a segment selector. 4. ``code_alignment_factor`` is 4 bytes. .. TODO::. Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table. 5. ``data_alignment_factor`` is 4 bytes. .. TODO::. Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table. 6. ``return_address_register`` is ``PC_32`` for 32-bit processes and ``PC_64``; for 64-bit processes defined in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier`. 7. ``initial_instructions`` Since a subprogram X with fewer registers can be; called from subprogram Y that has more allocated, X will not change any of; the extra registers as it cannot access them. Therefore, the default rule; for all columns is ``same value``. For AMDGPU the register number follows the numbering defined in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier`. For AMDGPU the instructions are variable size. A consumer can subtract 1 from; the return address to get the address of a byte within the call site; instructions. See DWARF Version 5 section 6.4.4.

This section defines the AMDGPU target architecture specific DWARF mappings. .. _amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier:. Register Identifier; -------------------. This section defines the AMDGPU target architecture register numbers used in; DWARF operation expressions (see DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`) and Call Frame Information; instructions (see DWARF Version 5 section 6.4 and; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`). A single code object can contain code for kernels that have different wavefront; sizes. The vector registers and some scalar registers are based on the wavefront; size. AMDGPU defines distinct DWARF registers for each wavefront size. This; simplifies the consumer of the DWARF so that each register has a fixed size,; rather than being dynamic according to the wavefront size mode. Similarly,; distinct DWARF registers are defined for those registers that vary in size; according to the process address size. This allows a consumer to treat a; specific AMDGPU processor as a single architecture regardless of how it is; configured at run time. The compiler explicitly specifies the DWARF registers; that match the mode in which the code it is generating will be executed. DWARF registers are encoded as numbers, which are mapped to architecture; registers. The mapping for AMDGPU is defined in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-mapping-table`.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address space allows location expressions; to specify the unswizzled private address space corresponding to the wavefront; that is executing the focused thread of execution. The wavefront view of private; memory is the per wavefront unswizzled backing memory layout defined in; :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`, such that address 0 corresponds to the first; location for the backing memory of the wavefront (namely the address is not; offset by ``wavefront-scratch-base``). The following formula can be used to; convert from a ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address to a; ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address:. ::. private-address-wavefront =; ((private-address-lane / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address-lane % 4).

The frame pointer can be a private lane address which is dword aligned,; which can be shifted to multiply by the wavefront size, and then used to form a; private wavefront address that gives a location for a contiguous set of dwords,; one per lane, where the vector register dwords are spilled.

From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store.

For an example of these look at the ARM (first five lowerings) or RISC-V (last; lowering) backend. AtomicExpandPass supports two strategies for lowering atomicrmw/cmpxchg to; load-linked/store-conditional (LL/SC) loops. The first expands the LL/SC loop; in IR, calling target lowering hooks to emit intrinsics for the LL and SC; operations. However, many architectures have strict requirements for LL/SC; loops to ensure forward progress, such as restrictions on the number and type; of instructions in the loop. It isn't possible to enforce these restrictions; when the loop is expanded in LLVM IR, and so affected targets may prefer to; expand to LL/SC loops at a very late stage (i.e. after register allocation).; AtomicExpandPass can help support lowering of part-word atomicrmw or cmpxchg; using this strategy by producing IR for any shifting and masking that can be; performed outside of the LL/SC loop. Libcalls: __atomic_*; ====================. There are two kinds of atomic library calls that are generated by LLVM. Please; note that both sets of library functions somewhat confusingly share the names of; builtin functions defined by clang. Despite this, the library functions are; not directly related to the builtins: it is *not* the case that ``__atomic_*``; builtins lower to ``__atomic_*`` library calls and ``__sync_*`` builtins lower; to ``__sync_*`` library calls. The first set of library functions are named ``__atomic_*``. This set has been; ""standardized"" by GCC, and is described below. (See also `GCC's documentation; <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM/LIbrary>`_). LLVM's AtomicExpandPass will translate atomic operations on data sizes above; ``MaxAtomicSizeInBitsSupported`` into calls to these functions. There are four generic functions, which can be called with data of any size",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst

There are also size-specialized versions of the above functions, which can only; be used with *naturally-aligned* pointers of the appropriate size. In the; signatures below, ""N"" is one of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, and ""iN"" is the appropriate; integer type of that size; if no such integer type exists, the specialization; cannot be used::. iN __atomic_load_N(iN *ptr, iN val, int ordering); void __atomic_store_N(iN *ptr, iN val, int ordering); iN __atomic_exchange_N(iN *ptr, iN val, int ordering); bool __atomic_compare_exchange_N(iN *ptr, iN *expected, iN desired, int success_order, int failure_order).

This set of library functions have some interesting implementation requirements; to take note of:. - They support all sizes and alignments -- including those which cannot be; implemented natively on any existing hardware. Therefore, they will certainly; use mutexes in for some sizes/alignments. - As a consequence, they cannot be shipped in a statically linked; compiler-support library, as they have state which must be shared amongst all; DSOs loaded in the program.

Note that it's possible to write an entirely target-independent implementation; of these library functions by using the compiler atomic builtins themselves to; implement the operations on naturally-aligned pointers of supported sizes, and a; generic mutex implementation otherwise. Libcalls: __sync_*; ==================. Some targets or OS/target combinations can support lock-free atomics, but for; various reasons, it is not practical to emit the instructions inline. There's two typical examples of this. Some CPUs support multiple instruction sets which can be switched back and forth; on function-call boundaries. For example, MIPS supports the MIPS16 ISA, which; has a smaller instruction encoding than the usual MIPS32 ISA. ARM, similarly,; has the Thumb ISA. In MIPS16 and earlier versions of Thumb, the atomic; instructions are not encodable. However, those instructions are available via a; function call to a function with the longer encoding. Additionally, a few OS/target pairs provide kernel-supported lock-free; atomics. ARM/Linux is an example of this: the kernel `provides; <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/kernel_user_helpers.txt>`_ a; function which on older CPUs contains a ""magically-restartable"" atomic sequence; (which looks atomic so long as there's only one CPU), and contains actual atomic; instructions on newer multicore models. This sort of functionality can typically; be provided on any architecture, if all CPUs which are missing atomic; compare-and-swap support are uniprocessor (no SMP). This is almost always the; case. The only common architecture without that property is SPARC -- SPARCV8 SMP; systems were common, yet it doesn't support any sort of compare-and-swap; operation.

In this case, the user is responsible for ensuring that; necessary ``__sync_*`` implementations are available.

Introduction; ============. LLVM supports instructions which are well-defined in the presence of threads and; asynchronous signals. The atomic instructions are designed specifically to provide readable IR and; optimized code generation for the following:. * The C++ ``<atomic>`` header and C ``<stdatomic.h>`` headers. These; were originally added in C++11 and C11. The memory model has been; subsequently adjusted to correct errors in the initial; specification, so LLVM currently intends to implement the version; specified by C++20. (See the `C++20 draft standard; <https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N4860.pdf>`_ or the unofficial; `latest C++ draft <https://eel.is/c++draft/>`_. A `C2x draft; <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3047.pdf>`_ is; also available, though the text has not yet been updated with the; errata corrected by C++20.). * Proper semantics for Java-style memory, for both ``volatile`` and regular; shared variables. (`Java Specification; <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html>`_). * gcc-compatible ``__sync_*`` builtins. (`Description; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fsync-Builtins.html>`_). * Other scenarios with atomic semantics, including ``static`` variables with; non-trivial constructors in C++. Atomic and volatile in the IR are orthogonal; ""volatile"" is the C/C++ volatile,; which ensures that every volatile load and store happens and is performed in the; stated order. A couple examples: if a SequentiallyConsistent store is; immediately followed by another SequentiallyConsistent store to the same; address, the first store can be erased. This transformation is not allowed for a; pair of volatile stores. On the other hand, a non-volatile non-atomic load can; be moved across a volatile load freely, but not an Acquire load.

Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. It is; also possible to move stores from before an Acquire load or read-modify-write; operation to after it, and move non-Acquire loads from before an Acquire; operation to after it. Notes for code generation; Architectures with weak memory ordering (essentially everything relevant today; except x86 and SPARC) require some sort of fence to maintain the Acquire; semantics. The precise fences required varies widely by architecture, but for; a simple implementation, most architectures provide a barrier which is strong; enough for everything (``dmb`` on ARM, ``sync`` on PowerPC, etc.). Putting; such a fence after the equivalent Monotonic operation is sufficient to; maintain Acquire semantics for a memory operation. Release; -------. Release is similar to Acquire, but with a barrier of the sort necessary to; release a lock. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_release``. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution.; Release only provides a semantic guarantee when paired with an Acquire; operation. Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. It is; also possible to move loads from after a Release store or read-modify-write; operation to before it, and move non-Release stores from after a Release; operation to before it. Notes for code generation; See the section on Acquire; a fence before the relevant operation is usually; sufficient for Release. Note that a store-store fence is not sufficient to; implement Release semantics; store-store fences are generally not exposed to; IR because they are extremely difficult to use correctly.

This; is usually done by emitting either a full fence before the loads or a full; fence after the stores; which is preferred varies by architecture. Atomics and IR optimization; ===========================. Predicates for optimizer writers to query:. * ``isSimple()``: A load or store which is not volatile or atomic. This is; what, for example, memcpyopt would check for operations it might transform. * ``isUnordered()``: A load or store which is not volatile and at most; Unordered. This would be checked, for example, by LICM before hoisting an; operation. * ``mayReadFromMemory()``/``mayWriteToMemory()``: Existing predicate, but note; that they return true for any operation which is volatile or at least; Monotonic. * ``isStrongerThan`` / ``isAtLeastOrStrongerThan``: These are predicates on; orderings. They can be useful for passes that are aware of atomics, for; example to do DSE across a single atomic access, but not across a; release-acquire pair (see MemoryDependencyAnalysis for an example of this). * Alias analysis: Note that AA will return ModRef for anything Acquire or; Release, and for the address accessed by any Monotonic operation. To support optimizing around atomic operations, make sure you are using the; right predicates; everything should work if that is done. If your pass should; optimize some atomic operations (Unordered operations in particular), make sure; it doesn't replace an atomic load or store with a non-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop. It just treats; monotonic operations like a read+write to a memory location, and anything; stricter than that like a nothrow",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst

The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store. A ``fence`` provides Acquire and/or Release ordering which is not part; of another operation; it is normally used along with Monotonic memory; operations. A Monotonic load followed by an Acquire fence is roughly; equivalent to an Acquire load, and a Monotonic store following a; Release fence is roughly equivalent to a Release; store. SequentiallyConsistent fences behave as both an Acquire and a; Release fence, and additionally provide a total ordering with some; complicated guarantees, see the C++ standard for details.

They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef.

If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.).

Release is similar to Acquire, but with a barrier of the sort necessary to; release a lock. Relevant standard; This corresponds to the C++/C ``memory_order_release``. Notes for frontends; If you are writing a frontend which uses this directly, use with caution.; Release only provides a semantic guarantee when paired with an Acquire; operation. Notes for optimizers; Optimizers not aware of atomics can treat this like a nothrow call. It is; also possible to move loads from after a Release store or read-modify-write; operation to before it, and move non-Release stores from after a Release; operation to before it. Notes for code generation; See the section on Acquire; a fence before the relevant operation is usually; sufficient for Release. Note that a store-store fence is not sufficient to; implement Release semantics; store-store fences are generally not exposed to; IR because they are extremely difficult to use correctly.

This set of library functions have some interesting implementation requirements; to take note of:. - They support all sizes and alignments -- including those which cannot be; implemented natively on any existing hardware. Therefore, they will certainly; use mutexes in for some sizes/alignments. - As a consequence, they cannot be shipped in a statically linked; compiler-support library, as they have state which must be shared amongst all; DSOs loaded in the program. They must be provided in a shared library used by; all objects. - The set of atomic sizes supported lock-free must be a superset of the sizes; any compiler can emit. That is: if a new compiler introduces support for; inline-lock-free atomics of size N, the ``__atomic_*`` functions must also have a; lock-free implementation for size N. This is a requirement so that code; produced by an old compiler (which will have called the ``__atomic_*`` function); interoperates with code produced by the new compiler (which will use native; the atomic instruction). Note that it's possible to write an entirely target-independent implementation; of these library functions by using the compiler atomic builtins themselves to; implement the operations on naturally-aligned pointers of supported sizes, and a; generic mutex implementation otherwise.

From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }.

However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (wh",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst

Loads and stores generate normal instructions. ``cmpxchg`` and; ``atomicrmw`` can be represented using a loop with LL/SC-style instructions; which take some sort of exclusive lock on a cache line (``LDREX`` and ``STREX``; on ARM, etc.). It is often easiest for backends to use AtomicExpandPass to lower some of the; atomic constructs. Here are some lowerings it can do:. * cmpxchg -> loop with load-linked/store-conditional; by overriding ``shouldExpandAtomicCmpXchgInIR()``, ``emitLoadLinked()``,; ``emitStoreConditional()``; * large loads/stores -> ll-sc/cmpxchg; by overriding ``shouldExpandAtomicStoreInIR()``/``shouldExpandAtomicLoadInIR()``; * strong atomic accesses -> monotonic accesses + fences by overriding; ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()``, ``emitLeadingFence()``, and; ``emitTrailingFence()``; * atomic rmw -> loop with cmpxchg or load-linked/store-conditional; by overriding ``expandAtomicRMWInIR()``; * expansion to __atomic_* libcalls for unsupported sizes.; * part-word atomicrmw/cmpxchg -> target-specific intrinsic by overriding; ``shouldExpandAtomicRMWInIR``, ``emitMaskedAtomicRMWIntrinsic``,; ``shouldExpandAtomicCmpXchgInIR``, and ``emitMaskedAtomicCmpXchgIntrinsic``. For an example of these look at the ARM (first five lowerings) or RISC-V (last; lowering) backend. AtomicExpandPass supports two strategies for lowering atomicrmw/cmpxchg to; load-linked/store-conditional (LL/SC) loops. The first expands the LL/SC loop; in IR, calling target lowering hooks to emit intrinsics for the LL and SC; operations. However, many architectures have strict requirements for LL/SC; loops to ensure forward progress, such as restrictions on the number and t",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst

However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store. A ``fence`` provides Acquire and/or Release ordering which is not part; of another operation; it is normally used along with Monotonic memory; operations. A Monotonic load followed by an Acquire fence is roughly; equivalent to an Acquire load, and a Monotonic store following a; Release fence is roughly equivalent to a Release; store.

If ``callee`` changed its signature to ``uint16x4_t``, which is equivalent in register content, if we passed as ``LD1`` we'd break this code until ``caller`` was updated and recompiled. There is an argument that if the signatures of the two functions are different then the behaviour should be undefined. But there may be functions that are agnostic to the lane layout of the vector, and treating the vector as an opaque value (just loading it and storing it) would be impossible without a common format across ABI boundaries. So to preserve ABI compatibility, we need to use the ``LDR`` lane layout across function calls. Alignment; ---------. In strict alignment mode, ``LDR qX`` requires its address to be 128-bit aligned, whereas ``LD1`` only requires it to be as aligned as the lane size.

The issue with lane ordering, it was decided, would have to change target-agnostic compiler passes and would result in a strange IR in which lane indices were reversed. It was decided that this was worse than the changes that would have to be made to support ``LD1``, so ``LD1`` was chosen as the canonical vector load instruction (and by inference, ``ST1`` for vector stores). Implementation; ==============. There are 3 parts to the implementation:. 1. Predicate ``LDR`` and ``STR`` instructions so that they are never allowed to be selected to generate vector loads and stores. The exception is one-lane vectors [1]_ - these by definition cannot have lane ordering problems so are fine to use ``LDR``/``STR``. 2.

The use of ``LDR`` and ``STR`` as the ABI defines has at least one advantage over ``LD1`` and ``ST1``. ``LDR`` and ``STR`` are oblivious to the size of the individual lanes of a vector. ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` are not - the lane size is encoded within them. This is important across an ABI boundary, because it would become necessary to know the lane width the callee expects. Consider the following code:. .. code-block:: c. <callee.c>; void callee(uint32x2_t v) {; ...; }. <caller.c>; extern void callee(uint32x2_t);; void caller() {; callee(...);; }.

Without this property there would be many special cases that the optimizer would have to cleverly handle. Use of ``LDR`` would break this lane ordering property. This doesn't preclude the use of ``LDR``, but we would have to do one of two things:. 1. Insert a ``REV`` instruction to reverse the lane order after every ``LDR``.; 2. Disable all optimizations that rely on lane layout, and for every access to an individual lane (``insertelement``/``extractelement``/``shufflevector``) reverse the lane index. AAPCS; -----. The ARM procedure call standard (AAPCS) defines the ABI for passing vectors between functions in registers. It states:. When a short vector is transferred between registers and memory it is treated as an opaque object. That is a short vector is stored in memory as if it were stored with a single ``STR`` of the entire register; a short vector is loaded from memory using the corresponding ``LDR`` instruction. On a little-endian system this means that element 0 will always contain the lowest addressed element of a short vector; on a big-endian system element 0 will contain the highest-addressed element of a short vector. -- Procedure Call Standard for the ARM 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), 4.1.2 Short Vectors. The use of ``LDR`` and ``STR`` as the ABI defines has at least one advantage over ``LD1`` and ``ST1``. ``LDR`` and ``STR`` are oblivious to the size of the individual lanes of a vector. ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` are not - the lane size is encoded within them. This is important across an ABI boundary, because it would become necessary to know the lane width the callee expects. Consider the following code:. .. code-block:: c. <callee.c>; void callee(uint32x2_t v) {; ...; }. <caller.c>; extern void callee(uint32x2_t);; void caller() {; callee(...);; }.

If ``callee`` changed its signature to ``uint16x4_t``, which is equivalent in register content, if we passed as ``LD1`` we'd break this code until ``caller`` was updated and recompiled. There is an argument that if the signatures of the two functions are different then the behaviour should be undefined. But there may be functions that are agnostic to the lane layout of the vector, and treating the vector as an opaque value (just loading it and storing it) would be impossible without a common format across ABI boundaries. So to preserve ABI compatibility, we need to use the ``LDR`` lane layout across function calls. Alignment; ---------. In strict alignment mode, ``LDR qX`` requires its address to be 128-bit aligned, whereas ``LD1`` only requires it to be as aligned as the lane size. If we canonicalised on using ``LDR``, we'd still need to use ``LD1`` in some places to avoid alignment faults (the result of the ``LD1`` would then need to be reversed with ``REV``). Most operating systems however do not run with alignment faults enabled, so this is often not an issue. Summary; -------.

If ``callee`` changed its signature to ``uint16x4_t``, which is equivalent in register content, if we passed as ``LD1`` we'd break this code until ``caller`` was updated and recompiled. There is an argument that if the signatures of the two functions are different then the behaviour should be undefined. But there may be functions that are agnostic to the lane layout of the vector, and treating the vector as an opaque value (just loading it and storing it) would be impossible without a common format across ABI boundaries. So to preserve ABI compatibility, we need to use the ``LDR`` lane layout across function calls. Alignment; ---------. In strict alignment mode, ``LDR qX`` requires its address to be 128-bit aligned, whereas ``LD1`` only requires it to be as aligned as the lane size. If we canonicalised on using ``LDR``, we'd still need to use ``LD1`` in some places to avoid alignment faults (the result of the ``LD1`` would then need to be reversed with ``REV``).

The ARM procedure call standard (AAPCS) defines the ABI for passing vectors between functions in registers. It states:. When a short vector is transferred between registers and memory it is treated as an opaque object. That is a short vector is stored in memory as if it were stored with a single ``STR`` of the entire register; a short vector is loaded from memory using the corresponding ``LDR`` instruction. On a little-endian system this means that element 0 will always contain the lowest addressed element of a short vector; on a big-endian system element 0 will contain the highest-addressed element of a short vector. -- Procedure Call Standard for the ARM 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), 4.1.2 Short Vectors.

A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped!

The LLVM IR reader uses this mechanism to skip function; bodies, lazily reading them on demand. When reading and encoding the stream, several properties are maintained for the; block. In particular, each block maintains:. #. A current abbrev id width. This value starts at 2 at the beginning of the; stream, and is set every time a block record is entered.

Abbreviation IDs 4 and above are defined by the stream itself, and specify an; `abbreviated record encoding`_. .. _Blocks:. Blocks; ------. Blocks in a bitstream denote nested regions of the stream, and are identified by; a content-specific id number (for example, LLVM IR uses an ID of 12 to represent; function bodies). Block IDs 0-7 are reserved for `standard blocks`_ whose; meaning is defined by Bitcode; block IDs 8 and greater are application; specific. Nested blocks capture the hierarchical structure of the data encoded; in it, and various properties are associated with blocks as the file is parsed.; Block definitions allow the reader to efficiently skip blocks in constant time; if the reader wants a summary of blocks, or if it wants to efficiently skip data; it does not understand. The LLVM IR reader uses this mechanism to skip function; bodies, lazily reading them on demand. When reading and encoding the stream, several properties are maintained for the; block. In particular, each block maintains:. #. A current abbrev id width. This value starts at 2 at the beginning of the; stream, and is set every time a block record is entered. The block entry; specifies the abbrev id width for the body of the block. #. A set of abbreviations.

An ``UNABBREV_RECORD`` provides a default fallback encoding, which is both; completely general and extremely inefficient. It can describe an arbitrary; record by emitting the code and operands as VBRs. For example, emitting an LLVM IR target triple as an unabbreviated record; requires emitting the ``UNABBREV_RECORD`` abbrevid, a vbr6 for the; ``MODULE_CODE_TRIPLE`` code, a vbr6 for the length of the string, which is equal; to the number of operands, and a vbr6 for each character. Because there are no; letters with values less than 32, each letter would need to be emitted as at; least a two-part VBR, which means that each letter would require at least 12; bits. This is not an efficient encoding, but it is fully general. .. _abbreviated record encoding:. Abbreviated Record Encoding; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``[<abbrevid>, fields...]``. An abbreviated record is an abbreviation id followed by a set of fields that are; encoded according to the `abbreviation definition`_. This allows records to be; encoded significantly more densely than records encoded with the; `UNABBREV_RECORD`_ type, and allows the abbreviation types to be specified in; the stream itself, which allows the files to be completely self describing. The; actual encoding of abbreviations is defined below. The record code, which is the first field of an abbreviated record, may be; encoded in the abbreviation definition (as a literal operand) or supplied in the; abbreviated record (as a Fixed or VBR operand value). .. _abbreviation definition:.

The array operand has no; extra data, but expects another operand to follow it, indicating the element; type of the array. When reading an array in an abbreviated record, the first; integer is a vbr6 that indicates the array length, followed by the encoded; elements of the array. An array may only occur as the last operand of an; abbreviation (except for the one final operand that gives the array's; type). * Char6 (code 4): This field should be emitted as a `char6-encoded value`_.; This operand type takes no extra data. Char6 encoding is normally used as an; array element type. * Blob (code 5): This field is emitted as a vbr6, followed by padding to a; 32-bit boundary (for alignment) and an array of 8-bit objects. The array of; bytes is further followed by tail padding to ensure that its total length is a; multiple of 4 bytes. This makes it very efficient for the reader to decode; the data without having to make a copy of it: it can use a pointer to the data; in the mapped in file and poke directly at it.

Bitstream Format; ================. The bitstream format is literally a stream of bits, with a very simple; structure. This structure consists of the following concepts:. * A ""`magic number`_"" that identifies the contents of the stream. * Encoding `primitives`_ like variable bit-rate integers. * `Blocks`_, which define nested content. * `Data Records`_, which describe entities within the file. * Abbreviations, which specify compression optimizations for the file. Note that the :doc:`llvm-bcanalyzer <CommandGuide/llvm-bcanalyzer>` tool can be; used to dump and inspect arbitrary bitstreams, which is very useful for; understanding the encoding. .. _magic number:. Magic Numbers; -------------. The first four bytes of a bitstream are used as an application-specific magic; number. Generic bitcode tools may look at the first four bytes to determine; whether the stream is a known stream type. However, these tools should *not*; determine whether a bitstream is valid based on its magic number alone. New; application-specific bitstream formats are being developed all the time; tools; should not reject them just because they have a hitherto unseen magic number. .. _primitives:. Primitives; ----------.

Literal operands --- :raw-html:`<tt>` [1\ :sub:`1`, litvalue\; :sub:`vbr8`] :raw-html:`</tt>` --- Literal operands specify that the value in; the result is always a single specific value. This specific value is emitted; as a vbr8 after the bit indicating that it is a literal operand. #. Encoding info without data --- :raw-html:`<tt>` [0\ :sub:`1`, encoding\; :sub:`3`] :raw-html:`</tt>` --- Operand encodings that do not have extra data; are just emitted as their code. #. Encoding info with data --- :raw-html:`<tt>` [0\ :sub:`1`, encoding\; :sub:`3`, value\ :sub:`vbr5`] :raw-html:`</tt>` --- Operand encodings that do; have extra data are emitted as their code, followed by the extra data. The possible operand encodings are:. * Fixed (code 1): The field should be emitted as a `fixed-width value`_, whose; width is specified by the operand's extra data. * VBR (code 2): The field should be emitted as a `variable-width value`_, whose; width is specified by the operand's extra data. * Array (code 3): This field is an array of values. The array operand has no; extra data, but expects another operand to follow it, indicating the element; type of the array. When reading an array in an abbreviated record, the first; integer is a vbr6 that indicates the array length, followed by the encoded; elements of the array. An array may only occur as the last operand of an; abbreviation (except for the one final operand that gives the array's; type). * Char6 (code 4): This field should be emitted as a `char6-encoded value`_.; This operand type takes no extra data. Char6 encoding is normally used as an; array element type. * Blob (code 5): This field is emitted as a vbr6, followed by padding to a; 32-bit boundary (for alignment) and an array of 8-bit objects. The array of; bytes is further followed by tail padding to ensure that its total length is a; multiple of 4 bytes.

Native Object File Wrapper Format; =================================. Bitcode files for LLVM IR may also be wrapped in a native object file; (i.e. ELF, COFF, Mach-O). The bitcode must be stored in a section of the object; file named ``__LLVM,__bitcode`` for MachO or ``.llvmbc`` for the other object; formats. ELF objects additionally support a ``.llvm.lto`` section for; :doc:`FatLTO`, which contains bitcode suitable for LTO compilation (i.e. bitcode; that has gone through a pre-link LTO pipeline). The ``.llvmbc`` section; predates FatLTO support in LLVM, and may not always contain bitcode that is; suitable for LTO (i.e. from ``-fembed-bitcode``). The wrapper format is useful; for accommodating LTO in compilation pipelines where intermediate objects must; be native object files which contain metadata in other sections. . Not all tools support this format. For example, lld and the gold plugin will; ignore the ``.llvmbc`` section when linking object files, but can use; ``.llvm.lto`` sections when passed the correct command line options. .. _encoding of LLVM IR:. LLVM IR Encoding; ================. LLVM IR is encoded into a bitstream by defining blocks and records.
