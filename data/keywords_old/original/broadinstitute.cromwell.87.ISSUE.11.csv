https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5946:449,Availability,down,download,449,"Originally posted this two in the JIRA issue tracker back in August. Reposting here since it didn't get a response over there: https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/browse/BA-6548. > Hello everyone,; >; > I am attempting to use the AWS Batch backend for Cromwell to run a wdl script which runs several subjobs in parallel. I believe the correct parlance is a scatter. I noticed that in some of the jobs of the scatter, some reference files failed to download from S3 even though they existed (Connection Reset by Peer). This failure caused the overall job to fail after one hour of running.; >; > I believe this issue was reported and fixed before, around May 2019, but recently, in June 2020, it appears the AWS Batch backend was majorly overhauled (by @markjschreiber, thanks! Also, tagging you because I suspect you might be the resident expert here :) ), and the previous fix (using the ecs proxy image) was supposedly obsoleted.; > ; > I also see that the s3fs library appears to be vendored into cromwell, and after digging around, it appears that one might be able to set retries via an environment variable(?). But even then, I feel like if that were to work, it would be much nicer if it was configurable through cromwell's config file somehow.; >; > So that brings me to my final question. Is there some configuration that allows me to retry failed downloads some number of times before failing the whole job? Or, perhap there is some alternative configuraiton which I've overlooked and someone could point me to it? Thanks!. In addition, just wondering if perhaps there is a service limit I might be running into?",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5946

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5966:629,Performance,cache,cache,629,"Hi, . I have a question/require help. When implementing call caching and using a scatter, if a task/shard fails does cromwell restart then entire task?. Example. I am running ~200 alignments creating ~200 bam files, rather large ones, say if 190 complete and the last one fails, when I restart I am seeing that the entire 200 bam alignments are run again. Is it possible to have cromwell's call caching resume after the 190 completed alignments as opposed to rerunning them?. Has anyone come across this? I am thinking it might be possible using the following parameters. 1. - ContinueWhilePossible = true; 2. - System.file-hash-cache = true; 3. - System.graceful-server-shutdown = true. We are currently trying this but I wanted to see if anyone has come across this as well?.

I have set up a Cromwell platform on AWS batch according to https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/orchestration/cromwell/cromwell-overview/. If I run GATK Best Practice pipeline for one sample, it works perfectly. However, when I ran this pipeline for 10+ samples concurrently, many AWS EC2 instances were re-used by AWS batch. Cromwell didn't clean up the localized S3 files and output files produced by previous tasks. This quickly inflated EBS cost when EBS autoscaling is enabled. One of my instances went up to 9.1TB and hit the upper bound for autoscaling, then the running task failed due to no space. . I have checked Cromwell documents and some materials from AWS, as well as issue #4323. But none of them works for me.

In AWS Batch, retries can be specified in the job definition as described below-; Automated Job Retries - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_retries.html; Creating a Job Definition - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/create-job-definition.html. Is this supported in Cromwell? Could you please share information on how to do this? ; Adding the Jira issue I opened for reference-; https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/browse/CROM-6675.
