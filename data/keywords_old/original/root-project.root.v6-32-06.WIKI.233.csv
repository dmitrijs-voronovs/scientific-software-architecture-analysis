If TERMINATOR; returns 0, it means that the terminator has not been seen.; Otherwise it should return a pointer to the character immediately; following the terminator. The idea is to be able to read a line of input, or otherwise a hunk; of text, such as the head of an HTTP request, without crossing the; boundary, so that the next call to RecvRaw() etc. reads the data; after the hunk. To achieve that, this function does the following:. 1. Peek at incoming data. 2. Determine whether the peeked data, along with the previously; read data, includes the terminator. 3a. If yes, read the data until the end of the terminator, and; exit. 3b. If no, read the peeked data and goto 1. The function is careful to assume as little as possible about the; implementation of peeking. For example, every peek is followed by; a read. If the read returns a different amount of data, the; process is retried until all data arrives safely. Reads at most one less than the number of characters specified by maxsize. const char * HttpTerminator(const char* start, const char* peeked, Int_t peeklen); Determine whether [START, PEEKED + PEEKLEN) contains an HTTP new; line [\r]\n. If so, return the pointer to the position after the line,; otherwise return 0. This is used as callback to GetHunk(). The data; between START and PEEKED has been read and cannot be ""unread""; the; data after PEEKED has only been peeked.

The idea is to be able to read a line of input, or otherwise a hunk; of text, such as the head of an HTTP request, without crossing the; boundary, so that the next call to RecvRaw() etc. reads the data; after the hunk. To achieve that, this function does the following:. 1. Peek at incoming data. 2. Determine whether the peeked data, along with the previously; read data, includes the terminator. 3a. If yes, read the data until the end of the terminator, and; exit. 3b. If no, read the peeked data and goto 1. The function is careful to assume as little as possible about the; implementation of peeking. For example, every peek is followed by; a read. If the read returns a different amount of data, the; process is retried until all data arrives safely. Reads at most one less than the number of characters specified by maxsize. const char * HttpTerminator(const char* start, const char* peeked, Int_t peeklen); Determine whether [START, PEEKED + PEEKLEN) contains an HTTP new; line [\r]\n. If so, return the pointer to the position after the line,; otherwise return 0. This is used as callback to GetHunk(). The data; between START and PEEKED has been read and cannot be ""unread""; the; data after PEEKED has only been peeked.

Ganis, CERN. TXNetFile is an extension of TNetFile able to deal with new xrootd; server. Its new features are:; - Automatic server kind recognition (xrootd load balancer, xrootd; data server, old rootd); - Backward compatibility with old rootd server (acts as an old; TNetFile); - Fault tolerance for read/write operations (read/write timeouts; and retry); - Internal connection timeout (tunable indipendently from the OS; one) handled by threads; - handling of redirections from server; - Single TCP physical channel for multiple TXNetFile's instances; inside the same application; So, each TXNetFile object client must send messages containing; its ID (streamid). The server, of course, will respond with; messages containing the client's ID, in order to make the client; able to recognize its message by matching its streamid with that; one contained in the server's response.; - Tunable log verbosity level (0 = nothing, 3 = dump read/write; buffers too!); - Many parameters configurable via TEnv facility (see SetParm(); methods).

TXNetFile is an extension of TNetFile able to deal with new xrootd; server. Its new features are:; - Automatic server kind recognition (xrootd load balancer, xrootd; data server, old rootd); - Backward compatibility with old rootd server (acts as an old; TNetFile); - Fault tolerance for read/write operations (read/write timeouts; and retry); - Internal connection timeout (tunable indipendently from the OS; one) handled by threads; - handling of redirections from server; - Single TCP physical channel for multiple TXNetFile's instances; inside the same application; So, each TXNetFile object client must send messages containing; its ID (streamid). The server, of course, will respond with; messages containing the client's ID, in order to make the client; able to recognize its message by matching its streamid with that; one contained in the server's response.; - Tunable log verbosity level (0 = nothing, 3 = dump read/write; buffers too!); - Many parameters configurable via TEnv facility (see SetParm(); methods).

Author: R. Hatcher 2000.04.21. All XTRU shapes are correctly rendered in wire mode but can encounter; difficulty when rendered as a solid with hidden surfaces. These; exceptions occur if the outline shape is not a convex polygon.; Both the X3D and OpenGL renderers expect polygons to be convex.; The OpenGL spec specifies that points defining a polygon using the; GL_POLYGON primitive may be rendered as the convex hull of that set. Solid rendering under X3D can also give unexpected artifacts if; the combination of x-y-z offsets and scales for the segments are; chosen in such a manner that they represent a concave shape when; sliced along a plane parallel to the z axis. Choosing sets of point that represent a malformed polygon is; not supported, but testing for such a condition is not implemented; and thus it is left to the user to avoid this mistake. .

Author: R. Hatcher 2000.04.21. All XTRU shapes are correctly rendered in wire mode but can encounter; difficulty when rendered as a solid with hidden surfaces. These; exceptions occur if the outline shape is not a convex polygon.; Both the X3D and OpenGL renderers expect polygons to be convex.; The OpenGL spec specifies that points defining a polygon using the; GL_POLYGON primitive may be rendered as the convex hull of that set. Solid rendering under X3D can also give unexpected artifacts if; the combination of x-y-z offsets and scales for the segments are; chosen in such a manner that they represent a concave shape when; sliced along a plane parallel to the z axis. Choosing sets of point that represent a malformed polygon is; not supported, but testing for such a condition is not implemented; and thus it is left to the user to avoid this mistake. .

Notice that; the ROOT files should not be compressed when being added to the; ZIP file, since ROOT files are normally already compressed.; Such a ZIP file should be created like:. zip -n root multi file1.root file2.root. which creates a ZIP file multi.zip. A ZIP archive consists of files compressed with the popular ZLIB; compression algorithm. The archive format is used among others by; PKZip and Info-ZIP. The compression algorithm is also used by; GZIP and the PNG graphics standard. The format of the archives is; explained briefly below. This class provides an interface to read; such archives. A ZIP archive contains a prefix, series of archive members; (sub-files), and a central directory.

Notice that; the ROOT files should not be compressed when being added to the; ZIP file, since ROOT files are normally already compressed.; Such a ZIP file should be created like:. zip -n root multi file1.root file2.root. which creates a ZIP file multi.zip. A ZIP archive consists of files compressed with the popular ZLIB; compression algorithm. The archive format is used among others by; PKZip and Info-ZIP. The compression algorithm is also used by; GZIP and the PNG graphics standard. The format of the archives is; explained briefly below. This class provides an interface to read; such archives.

The TPyROOTApplication sets up the nuts and bolts for interactive ROOT use; from python, closely following TRint. Note that not everything is done here,; some bits (such as e.g. the use of exception hook for shell escapes) are more; easily done in python and you'll thus find them ROOT.py. The intended use of this class is from python only. It is used by default in; ROOT.py, so if you do not want to have a TApplication derived object created; for you, you'll need to load libPyROOT.so instead. The static InitXYZ functions are used in conjunction with TPyROOTApplication; in ROOT.py, but they can be used independently. NOTE: This class will receive the command line arguments from sys.argv. A; distinction between arguments for TApplication and user arguments can be; made by using ""-"" or ""--"" as a separator on the command line.
