CROM-6718: FR: Add flag for minimizing chance of GCP cross-region network egress charges being incurred. This PR specifically focuses on the risks of egress charges incurred due to call caching. The framing of the approach here, which is a bit broader than originally noted in CROM-6718, is:; Make call caching location-aware, prioritizing copies that minimize egress charges.; Add a workflow option enabling control of what egress charges can be incurred for call cache copying.; The new workflow option would be:. call_cache_egress: [none, continental, global]. where the values affect whether call cache copies can incur egress charges:; none: only within-region copies are allowed, which generate no egress charges; continental: within content copies are allowed; within-content copies have reduced costs, such as $0.01 / GB in the US; global: copies across all regions are allowed. Cross-content egress charges can be much higher (ranging from $0.08 / GB up to $0.23 / GB). ### CURRENT STATUS OF PR:; These first few commits are a WIP/request for feedback. I would love discussion on what the best approach would be. The idea for this initial approach is to raise an exception right before copying cached outputs if the bucket locations would cause an egress charge (depending on workflow option).

If this is not currently possible, could I request adding the ability to define additional mount points as a feature request??.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6339:154,Deployability,pipeline,pipeline,154,"Hi everyone, . When I use cromwell + PBS backend I found the way that jobs are scheduled has some differences from using PBS alone. For example, I have a pipeline of 2 steps, A-B, where B depends on A. Now I want to submit this pipeline for 2 times which will generate 4 jobs A1 B1 A2 B2. Let's assume the cluster only have resource to run one of the jobs at a time. . When I use PBS alone all of the 4 jobs will be in the queue, at the beginning A1 gets to run and the others waiting. When A1 is done B1, A2 both have a chance to run depending on the priority PBS assigns to them. So the order of the four jobs might be A1-B1-A2-B2 or A1-A2-B1-B2. When I use cromwell + PBS backend cromwell will first send A1 and A2 to the queue without B1 and B2 since they won't be ready to run until A1 and A2 are done. When A1 is done A2 gets to run because it's the only job in the queue while B1 is on its way to the queue. So in this case the order of these jobs can only be A1-A2-B1-B2. This is not big issue when there are only a few pipelines to run. However, when I have, say 100 such pipelines, B1 has to wait until A100 to finish since when A1 finishes A2-A99 are already in the queue waiting and B1 has just set off. This means the finishing time of pipeline1(A1-B1) will be affected a lot by the total number of pipelines submitted to cromwell engine. . Is there any way for cromwell to change this situation (like sending all jobs to the backend without blocking any of them)? I really don't want to wait until all ""A""s to finish to get the first result of submitted pipelines. Hope I have made this problem clear. I have read the documents of cromwell and googled quit a bit but didn't find any solution. . Any help would be appreciated!.

Is there any way for cromwell to change this situation (like sending all jobs to the backend without blocking any of them)? I really don't want to wait until all ""A""s to finish to get the first result of submitted pipelines. Hope I have made this problem clear.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6339:908,Performance,queue,queue,908,"Hi everyone, . When I use cromwell + PBS backend I found the way that jobs are scheduled has some differences from using PBS alone. For example, I have a pipeline of 2 steps, A-B, where B depends on A. Now I want to submit this pipeline for 2 times which will generate 4 jobs A1 B1 A2 B2. Let's assume the cluster only have resource to run one of the jobs at a time. . When I use PBS alone all of the 4 jobs will be in the queue, at the beginning A1 gets to run and the others waiting. When A1 is done B1, A2 both have a chance to run depending on the priority PBS assigns to them. So the order of the four jobs might be A1-B1-A2-B2 or A1-A2-B1-B2. When I use cromwell + PBS backend cromwell will first send A1 and A2 to the queue without B1 and B2 since they won't be ready to run until A1 and A2 are done. When A1 is done A2 gets to run because it's the only job in the queue while B1 is on its way to the queue. So in this case the order of these jobs can only be A1-A2-B1-B2. This is not big issue when there are only a few pipelines to run.

If such functionality exists, are there docs on this subject?.

The framing of the approach here, which is a bit broader than originally noted in CROM-6718, is:; Make call caching location-aware, prioritizing copies that minimize egress charges.; Add a workflow option enabling control of what egress charges can be incurred for call cache copying.; The new workflow option would be:. call_cache_egress: [none, continental, global]. where the values affect whether call cache copies can incur egress charges:; none: only within-region copies are allowed, which generate no egress charges; continental: within content copies are allowed; within-content copies have reduced costs, such as $0.01 / GB in the US; global: copies across all regions are allowed. Cross-content egress charges can be much higher (ranging from $0.08 / GB up to $0.23 / GB). ### CURRENT STATUS OF PR:; With the changes in this PR, Cromwell successfully checks the location of the source and destination file to be copied, compares the location, and makes a decision of whether or not it should be copied based on the call_cache_egress option. If it should be copied, the files are copied as normal. If it should not be copied, the cache attempt fails and the workflow runs instead.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6432

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6439:919,Availability,error,error,919,"The `DrsCloudNioFileSystemProvider` was wrapping the retries of the `DrsPathResolver` with another set of `CloudNioRetry` retries. The product of these two retries at the previous configuration values would wait around 35 minutes (~:20 + 10 x ~3:30) to fail for each doomed attempt. That combined with a fairly wide scatter and a typo'd DRS path for `file` in code like . ```; task size {; input {; File file; }. Int file_size = ceil(size(file)); ...; }; ```; would completely block all 10 of the `IoActor`s [NIO threads](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/engine/src/main/scala/cromwell/server/CromwellRootActor.scala#L108). These changes remove the nested retries in the engine and dial back the patience for retries. If we want the retries to be more patient we'll probably have to make other code that is competing for `IoActor` threads more patient as well. Utility files for reproducing this error can be cherry picked from commit `ff7bddc8830802f7a606177d0eaf19c8f47ca865`. I don't know how to programatically link Google accounts to NIH accounts in Bond to be able to include this Centaur test in CI, though maybe we don't need to be linked to make sure this negative case errors within a reasonable timeout?.

In an attempt to use cromwell for running genomics pipeline(s) I encountered a few issues that prevent me from using these otherwise wonderful tools. Specific to my case, I would like to use Google Life Sciences v2beta in the region `europe-west4` due to data localisation needs. I mention this because of another recent Hellow World related issue #6462 where the demo did seem to work. 1) The documentation for the [Hello World](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/PipelinesApi101/#lets-get-started) example is out of date. In `google.conf` it still lists the configuration for ""JES"" backend. 2) In the same tutorial ([Setting up PAPIv2](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/PipelinesApi101/#setting-up-papiv2)), the instructions for which roles to assign to the GCP service account are outdated. 3) Once the user puzzles together which parts to replace, the execution is still failing (for me at least).; I run the following command ` java -Dconfig.file=cromwell.BROADexamples.v4.conf -jar cromwell-66.jar run hello.wdl -i hello.inputs`, which results in the following `Request contains an invalid argument.` error (abbreviated to the relevant section):; ```; [2021-08-13 10:44:39,31] [info] Running with database db.url = jdbc:hsqldb:mem: ...; ...; [2021-08-13 10:44:54,04] [info] Reference disks feature for PAPIv2 backend is not configured.; [2021-08-13 10:44:54,46] [info] Slf4jLogger started; [2021-08-13 10:44:54,73] [info] Workflow heartbeat configuration:; ...; [2021-08-13 10:44:55,42] [info] Running with 3 PAPI request workers; ...; [2021-08-13 10:44:55,79] [info] Unspecified type (Unspecified version) workflow a15c46b7-5f93-46d6-94a2-28f656914866 submitted; ...; [2021-08-13 10:44:56,46] [info] Request manager PAPIQueryManager created new PAPI request worker PAPIQueryWorker-58e6b395-916e-4ba4-965a-0ec8f1c0760d with batch interval of 3333 milliseconds; ...; [2021-08-13 10:44:56,67] [info] MaterializeWorkflowDescriptorActor [a",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6469

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6504:8157,Testability,test,test,8157,"c7a4450ada7c/call-cluster/cluster-rc.txt`, while I only have `s3://gred-cumulus-dev` bucket. . I'm wondering where `s3.amazonaws.com` prefix came from. I searched through Cromwell's source code, and found [this](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/filesystems/s3/src/main/java/org/lerch/s3fs/S3FileSystemProvider.java#L47.) file is probably the place to check. Due to its specification, The S3 Filesystem Provider will attach `s3.amazonaws.com` if `endpoint` is missing, to be `s3://[endpoint]/{bucket}/{key}` for the URI. However, I could not find any information regarding endpoint on Cromwell's readthedocs website. I'm wondering if this error was because I missed something in my conf file. My conf file is the following:. ```; include required(classpath(""application"")). aws {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""default""; scheme = ""default""; }; ]. region = ""us-west-2""; }. engine {; filesystems {; s3 {; auth = ""default""; }; }; }. backend {; default = ""AWSBatch"". providers {; AWSBatch {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.aws.AwsBatchBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; default-runtime-attributes {; scriptBucketName = ""gred-cumulus-dev""; queueArn: ""arn:aws:batch:us-west-2:752311211819:job-queue/priority-gwfcore-test""; }. filesystems {; s3 {; # A reference to a potentially different auth for manipulating files via engine functions.; auth = ""default""; }; }. # Emit a warning if jobs last longer than this amount of time.

This auth is used to create; # Jobs and manipulate auth JSONs.; auth = ""default""; # Base bucket for workflow executions; root = ""s3://gred-cumulus-dev/cromwell-execution""; }; }; }; }; ```. Could anyone please give me a hand on resolving this issue? Thanks!.
