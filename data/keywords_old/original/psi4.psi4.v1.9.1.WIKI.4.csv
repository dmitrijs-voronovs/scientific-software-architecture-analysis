Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. For LRC functionals, the choice of range-separtion parameter has; been the subject of considerable activity since the inception of LRC; functionals. Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between -electron and -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz. This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. Note that LRC functionals with default only capture the; dependence,. hybrid functionals only capture part of the dependence,. and local functionals decay exponentially, resulting in completely incorrect; asymptotics,. IP-tuned LRC functionals effectively pin the chemical potential at ; electrons to the correct value determined by the ionization potential. This; often cleans up the MSIE problem for a surprisingly large number of high-lying; occupied orbitals, as determined by fractional particle curves.

Pruned grids are; not yet available, but will be implemented by RC1 (in final debugging). The; default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:.

For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-12.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled.

Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies.

Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. Psi4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number .; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS.

You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds.

The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB; from frac import *. molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c1 # IP fitting must be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_functional wb97; }. # Arguments are molecule object, minimum omega, maximum omega; ip_fitting(h2o, 0.4, 2.0). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled.

Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies.

Larger systems,; particularly conjugated systems, will typically have an optimized ; between 0.1 and 0.5. Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. Psi4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number .; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn-Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree-Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount. Note that the term; “exact-exchange” refers to the Hartree-Fock being the exact exchange energy of; the noninteracting quasiparticles, not the true electrons. Therefore, adding; 100% exact exchange is not physically reasonable, and will often lead to; extremely poor results. The fraction of exact-exchange, denoted ,; is often determined by adiabatic or heuristic arguments, and is typically around; 25%. The addition of exact exchange borrows another piece from an existing; Hartree-Fock code, with the caveat that Hartree-Fock exchange is often much more; costly to obtain than the Coulomb matrix.

LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole. Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. For LRC functionals, the choice of range-separtion parameter has; been the subject of considerable activity since the inception of LRC; functionals. Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between -electron and -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” approach is a de facto industry standard. The more modern “-D3”; approach is gaining popularity, and may supersede -D2 in the next few years. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp').

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in Szabo on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; Psi4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by the DFT_FUNCTIONAL; option:; set dft_functional b3lyp; energy('scf'). For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree-Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in Psi4, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:.

Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; Psi4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use.

The individual atomic are interpolated from; several reference values based upon coordination numbers extracted from; the molecular structure, rather than assigned solely by atomic identity as; in DFT-D2, and thereby incorporate some awareness of the chemical; environment into an otherwise largely heuristic correction.

The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; , obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, , modulated; by a damping function, , that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by ); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; , while an overall scaling term, , is optimized; to be unique to each functional.

Grimme recently presented a refined method, DFT-D3, [Grimme:2010:154104]; which incorporates an additional term in the dispersion; series and adjusts the combination formula and damping; function. The individual atomic are interpolated from; several reference values based upon coordination numbers extracted from; the molecular structure, rather than assigned solely by atomic identity as; in DFT-D2, and thereby incorporate some awareness of the chemical; environment into an otherwise largely heuristic correction.

Documentation¶; Psi4‘s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman. It is available online at; http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/index.html; for the latest development branch. Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from psicode, so most users/developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; On Mac:; >>> pip install -U Sphinx; # or; >>> conda install sphinx. On Linux:. Download; >>> curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/S/Sphinx/Sphinx-1.3.1.tar.gz. Unpack, etc. Build and Install; >>> python setup.py build; >>> sudo python setup.py install. Check the path; >>> which sphinx-build; >>> which latex; >>> which dvipng. LaTeX and dvipng are needed to render math. If the latter is missing,; the following may work.; >>> sudo yum install dvipng. Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in the same; format, hyperlinking within and to trac/external websites, and generating; documentation in different formats from the same source. Psi4‘s; documentation is a unified document covering information for both users; and programmers in separate sections. From the top-level object directory,; build the following target (note that a working version of the Psi4; executable in bin/psi4 is a requirement for building the; documentation).:; >>> make sphinxman.

(That r"""""" makes the string read; literally, so your LaTeX symbols aren’t confused with escape characters.); For the two former, math has traditionally; been written in LaTeX (with the special substitution @@ for; subscripting underscore).

Adding a new Appendix or First-TOC-Level page; Create your reST file and fill it with information. Add the name of your; file to psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/appendices.rst for an appendix or; to psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/index.rst for a first-TOC-level.; Finally, add your file to the STATICDOC variable in; psi4/doc/sphinxman/CMakeLists.txt. Sphinx will now build with your; new page. Adding a new module to “Theoretical Methods”; Copy the file of a well-established module, like; psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst. Change the title, author, sec; label, ref, and source labels at the top of the file to point instead to; your code. Edit psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/methods.rst to add the; name of your file so that it will appear in the TOC tree. Add your file; to the STATICDOC variable in; psi4/doc/sphinxman/CMakeLists.txt. Sphinx will now build with your new; file. Follow the models in existing methods pages to write your; documentation.

Threading¶; Most new modules in Psi4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models.

This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals.

Obtaining Psi4¶; The latest version of the Psi4 program package may be; obtained at www.psicode.org. The; package is available as a binary for Linux (Installing; from Binary) or as source code (zipped; archive or git repository from www.github.com/psi4/psi4). Installing from Binary¶.

Compiling and Installing from Source¶; Detailed directions on; obtaining,; prerequisites,; building and installing,; and FAQ; are maintained on the GitHub Wiki.; If uncertain, start here. Scratch Files and Elementary Restart¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell Psi4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like Psi4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that Psi4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, Psi4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell Psi4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting.

Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. PBS job file¶; To run a Psi4 job on a PBS queueing system, you need to properly set up; all necessary variables in the PBS job file. Below is a minimal example of; a PBS job file for a threaded job, and a short explanation for each section.; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4; setenv MKL_NUM_THREADS 4; cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR; setenv myscratch /scratch/user/psi4.$PBS_JOBID. foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Creating scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; ssh $i mkdir -p $myscratch; end. unsetenv PSI4DATADIR; unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if !

These depend on the; specific characteristics of your PBS queuing system but they may include:; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node. The total memory requested for; the job by PBS should generally be slightly greater than what indicated; in the input file (see memory setting).; In the next section, we define OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; to use 4 threads for OpenMP parallelization and in threaded BLAS (see section Threading).; setenv OMP_",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/external-1.html

Threading¶; Most new modules in Psi4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for Psi4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in Psi4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled Psi4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in Psi4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/external-1.html

An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. PBS job file¶; To run a Psi4 job on a PBS queueing system, you need to properly set up; all necessary variables in the PBS job file.

Scratch Files and Elementary Restart¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell Psi4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like Psi4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that Psi4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, Psi4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell Psi4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file. For C shell (~/.tcshrc file):; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /scratch/user.

Threading¶; Most new modules in Psi4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for Psi4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in Psi4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled Psi4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in Psi4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables; The easiest/least visible way to thread Psi4 is to set the standard OpenMP/MKL; environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS.; For instance, in tcsh:; setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4; setenv MKL_NUM_THREADS 4.

Threading¶; Most new modules in Psi4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for Psi4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in Psi4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled Psi4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in Psi4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables; The easiest/least visible way to thread Psi4 is to set the standard OpenMP/MKL; environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS.; For instance, in tcsh:; setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4; setenv MKL_NUM_THREADS 4.

PSIDATADIR does not need to be set if Psi4 has been properly installed.; In the present example we unset it to make sure it does not interfere with the location; of the installed directory. PSIPATH is needed only if you are using external modules or; plugins in Psi4 and should point to the directories where they can be found. In the; present example, we make sure the variable is set with if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; before adding more paths to it. Finally, PSI_SCRATCH should point to a fast,; local disk for temporary file storage. The next step is then to actually run the computation:; /psi/install/directory/bin/psi4 -i input.in -o input.out. And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; Psi4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; The set of three commands below are completely equivalent, while the fourth is,; perhaps, the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

Psi4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the Psi4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where Psi4 was launched from) for restart purposes.

Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell Psi4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file. For C shell (~/.tcshrc file):; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /scratch/user.

This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals.

The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node.

For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where Psi4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). which is equivalent to; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True). A guide to the contents of individual scratch files may be found at PSIOH Intermediate Files.; To circumvent difficulties with running multiple jobs in the same scratch, the; process ID (PID) of the Psi4 instance is incorporated into the full file; name; therefore, it is safe to use the same scratch directory for calculations; running simultaneously. This also means that if the user wants Psi4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content.

Threading¶; Most new modules in Psi4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for Psi4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations.

From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled Psi4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in Psi4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/external.html

An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in Psi4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() Psithon function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a Psi4 input file.

(4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Compiling and Installing from Source¶; Detailed directions on; obtaining,; prerequisites,; building and installing,; and FAQ; are maintained on the GitHub Wiki.; If uncertain, start here. Scratch Files and Elementary Restart¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell Psi4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like Psi4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that Psi4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, Psi4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell Psi4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file. For C shell (~/.tcshrc file):; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /scratch/user. For Bash (~/.bashrc file):; export PSI_SCRATCH=/scratch/user. Psi4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations.

All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the Psi4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user').

For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where Psi4 was launched from) for restart purposes.

Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the Psi4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where Psi4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). which is equivalent to; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True). A guide to the contents of individual scratch files may be found at PSIOH Intermediate Files.; To circumvent difficulties with running multiple jobs in the same scratch, the; process ID (PID) of the Psi4 instance is incorporated into the full file; name; therefore, it is safe to use the same scratch directory for calculations; running sim",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/external.html

This also means that if the user wants Psi4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next Psi4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file. If two or more files; are to be read, they need to be provided as a Python list; energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']). Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing Psi4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; psi4 -m. ~/.psi4rc File¶; If using the environment variable PSI_SCRATCH is inconvenient,; or if some psi4_io commands must be present in all input files,; the ~/.psi4rc resource file can be used (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; All the commands mentioned in section Scratch Files and Elementary Restart can be used in this file,; namely:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). to set up the scratch path,; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). to set up the scratch path from a variable $MYSCRATCH,; psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). which is equivalent to; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True). to set up a specific path for the checkpoint file and instruct Psi4 not to delete it.; The Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file.

Threading¶; Most new modules in Psi4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for Psi4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in Psi4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled Psi4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in Psi4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables; The easiest/least visible way to thread Psi4 is to set the standard OpenMP/MKL; environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS.; For instance, in tcsh:; setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4; setenv MKL_NUM_THREADS 4. Psi4 then detects these value via the API routines in <omp.h> and; <mkl.h>, and runs all applicable code with 4 threads.

Psi4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the Psi4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where Psi4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). which is equivalent to; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True).

Users should leave this variable unset or set; to False. OMP_NUM_THREADS¶; Number of threads to use by modules with OpenMP threading. PATH¶; Path for interfaced executables. Note; Configuring Psi4 through PSIPATH is preferred; to modifying this environment variable. To run Kállay’s MRCC program; (see MRCC), the dmrcc executable must be in PATH.; Likewise to run Grimme’s dftd3 program (see dftd3), the; dftd3 executable must be in PATH. PSI_SCRATCH¶; Directory where scratch files are written. Overrides settings in ~/.psi4rc.; It is very important to ensure that Psi4 is writing its scratch files; to a disk drive physically attached to the computer running the computation.; If it is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; Modify PSI_SCRATCH through normal Linux shell commands before invoking psi4; # csh, tcsh; >>> setenv PSI_SCRATCH /scratch/user. # bash; >>> export PSI_SCRATCH=/scratch/user. You can also include the above",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/external.html

To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where Psi4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). which is equivalent to; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True). A guide to the contents of individual scratch files may be found at PSIOH Intermediate Files.; To circumvent difficulties with running multiple jobs in the same scratch, the; process ID (PID) of the Psi4 instance is incorporated into the full file; name; therefore, it is safe to use the same scratch directory for calculations; running simultaneously. This also means that if the user wants Psi4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next Psi4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file. If two or more files; are to be read, they need to be provided as a Python list; energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']).

Interface to programs through FCHK files, fchk()¶; Code author: Andrew C. Simmonett; Section author: Andrew C. Simmonett; Many post-processing tools can read information from Gaussian’s formatted; checkpoint (FCHK) files.; To allow interoperability with such tools, Psi4 includes a utility to; generate FCHK files. Wavefunction information, such as orbitals, densities,; orbital energies and basis set information is currently supported, but geometry; optimization and vibrational frequency information are not supported at this; time. To generate a FCHK file, simply store the wavefunction from the energy; calculation, and use it to create an FCHK writer:; energy, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); fchk_writer = psi4.FCHKWriter(wfn); fchk_writer.write('output.fchk'). The file will be written to the name passed to the FCHK writer’s write(); method. Note that for MP2 and CCSD methods, the energy can be computed without; the expensive steps required to compute the density, so energy calls for these; methods will return a wavefunction that has the Hartree-Fock density. If a; density is required for these methods, the user should instead request a; gradient computation, to ensure that the density is updated appropriately:; grad, wfn = gradient('mp2', return_wfn=True); fchk_writer = psi4.FCHKWriter(wfn); fchk_writer.write('output.fchk'). fchk(wfn, filename)[source]¶; Function to write wavefunction information in wfn to filename in; Gaussian FCHK format. New in version 0.6. Returns:None. Parameters:; filename (string) – destination file name for FCHK file; wfn (Wavefunction) – set of molecule, basis, orbitals from which to generate fchk file. Examples:. >>> # [1] FCHK file for DFT calculation; >>> E, wfn = energy('b3lyp', return_wfn=True); >>> fchk(wfn, 'mycalc.fchk'",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/fchk.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/fchk.html

The first set of energies printed corresponds to the second-order FNO; correction mentioned previously. Results for many-body perturbation; theory through partial fourth order are then provided.; The notation MP4(SDQ) indicates that we have included all contributions to; the correlation energy through fourth order, with the exception of that; from connected triple excitations.; One need not run a full QCISD or CCSD computation to obtain these; perturbation theory results. The keywords for invoking perturbation; theory computations are given below in; Table FNOCC Methods. Full MP4 correlation; energies are also available. Coupled electron pair approximation¶; Coupled-pair methods can be viewed as approximations to CCSD or as; size-extensive modifications of CISD. The methods have the same; complexity as CISD, and solving the CISD or coupled-pair equations; requires fewer floating point operations than solving the CCSD. CISD,; CCSD, and the coupled-pair methods discussed below all scale formally with; the sixth power of system size, and, as with the QCISD method, CEPA; methods retain complexity of the CCSD equations.; For a detailed discussion of the properties of various coupled-pair; methods, see Ref. [Wennmohs:2008:217].; What follows is a very basic description of the practical differences in; the equations that define each of the coupled-pair methods implemented in; Psi4. We begin with the CISD wave function. (3); where we have chosen the intermediate normalization, . The CISD correlation energy is given by. (4); and the amplitudes can be determined by the solution to the c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc-1.html

In a spin-free formalism, the pair energy; is given by. (7); Methods whose shifts ( and ) do not; explicitly depend on orbitals or (CISD, CEPA(0), ACPF,; and AQCC) have solutions that render the energy stationary with respect; variations in the amplitudes. This convenient property allows density; matrices and 1-electron properties to be evaluated without any additional; effort. Note, however, that 1-electron properties are currently; unavailable when coupling these stationary CEPA-like methods with frozen; natural orbitals. Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) [or the resolution of the identity (RI)] and Cholesky; decomposition (CD) techniques are popular in quantum chemistry to avoid; the computation and storage of the 4-index electron repulsion integral; (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the computational scaling of some terms.; DF/CD-CCSD(T) computations are available in Psi4, with or without the; use of FNOs, through the FNOCC module. The implementation and accuracy of; the DF/CD-CCSD(T) method are described in Ref. [DePrince:2013:2687].; The DF-CCSD(T) procedure uses two auxiliary basis sets. The first set is; that used in the SCF procedure, defined by the DF_BASIS_SCF; keyword. If this keyword is not specified, an appropriate -JKFIT set is; automatically selected. This auxiliary set defines the ERI’s used to; build the Fock matrix used in the DF-CCSD(T) procedure. The second; auxiliary set is used to approximate all other ERI’s in the DF-CCSD(T); procedure. The choice of auxiliary basis is controlled by the keyword; DF_BASIS_CC. By default, DF_BASIS_CC is the RI set; (optimized for DFMP2) most appropriate for use with the primary basis.; For example, if the primary basis is aug-cc-pVDZ, the default; DF_BASIS_CC will be aug-cc-pVDZ-RI.; Alternatively, the user can request that the DF-CCSD(T) procedure use a; set of vectors defined by the Cholesky decomposition",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc-1.html

Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) [or the resolution of the identity (RI)] and Cholesky; decomposition (CD) techniques are popular in quantum chemistry to avoid; the computation and storage of the 4-index electron repulsion integral; (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the computational scaling of some terms.; DF/CD-CCSD(T) computations are available in Psi4, with or without the; use of FNOs, through the FNOCC module. The implementation and accuracy of; the DF/CD-CCSD(T) method are described in Ref. [DePrince:2013:2687].; The DF-CCSD(T) procedure uses two auxiliary basis sets. The first set is; that used in the SCF procedure, defined by the DF_BASIS_SCF; keyword. If this keyword is not specified, an appropriate -JKFIT set is; automatically selected. This auxiliary set defines the ERI’s used to; build the Fock matrix used in the DF-CCSD(T) procedure. The second; auxiliary set is used to approximate all other ERI’s in the DF-CCSD(T); procedure. The choice of auxiliary basis is controlled by the keyword; DF_BASIS_CC. By default, DF_BASIS_CC is the RI set; (optimized for DFMP2) most appropriate for use with the primary basis.; For example, if the primary basis is aug-cc-pVDZ, the default; DF_BASIS_CC will be aug-cc-pVDZ-RI.; Alternatively, the user can request that the DF-CCSD(T) procedure use a; set of vectors defined by the Cholesky decomposition",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc.html

QCISD(T), CCSD(T), MP4, and CEPA¶; The FNOCC module in Psi4 supports several related many-body quantum; chemistry methods, including the CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) methods, several; orders of many-body perturbation theory (MP2-MP4), and a family methods; related to the coupled electron pair approximation (CEPA). Quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster¶; The quadratic configuration interaction singles doubles (QCISD) method of; Pople, Head-Gordon, and Raghavachari [Pople:1987:5968] was originally; presented as a size-consistent extension of configuration interaction; singles doubles (CISD). The method can also be obtained as a; simplified version of the coupled cluster singles doubles (CCSD); method [Purvis:1982]. Consider the set of equations defining CCSD:. (1); where we have chosen the intermediate normalization,; , and the symbols ; and represent single and double excitation operators. The; QCISD equations can be obtained by omitting all but two terms that; are nonlinear in and :. (2); QCISD is slightly cheaper that CCSD computationally, but it retains the; complexity of the original equations. Just as in; the familiar CCSD(T) method, the effects of connected triple excitations; may be included noniteratively to yield the QCISD(T) method. Both the; QCISD(T) and CCSD(T) methods are implemented for closed-shell references; in the FNOCC module. Many-body perturbation theory¶; QCI and CC methods are closely related to perturbation theory, and the; MP2, MP3, and MP4(SDQ) correlation energies can be obtained as a free; by-product of a CCSD or QCISD computation. The following is an; example of the results for a computation run with the",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/fnocc.html

The methods have the same; complexity as CISD, and solving the CISD or coupled-pair equations; requires fewer floating point operations than solving the CCSD. CISD,; CCSD, and the coupled-pair methods discussed below all scale formally with; the sixth power of system size, and, as with the QCISD method, CEPA; methods retain complexity of the CCSD equations.; For a detailed discussion of the properties of various coupled-pair; methods, see Ref.

An FCHK file will be generated for the GDMA code to read; this file will have; the prefix given by WRITER_FILE_LABEL (if set), or else by the name; of the output file plus the name of the current molecule, and the suffix will; be ‘.fchk’. This FCHK file name should be passed to the ‘File’ keyword in the; DGMA data file, to ensure that the GDMA code reads the correct wavefunction; information.; After running, two matrices of results can be accessed:; dma_results = get_array_variable('DMA DISTRIBUTED MULTIPOLES'); tot_results = get_array_variable('DMA TOTAL MULTIPOLES'). The first contains distributed multipoles, in units given by; GDMA_MULTIPOLE_UNITS, with the row index corresponding to the site and; the column index referencing the multipole component. Both indices are zero; based, and the components of the multipoles are ordered as; The second matrix returned has a single row, whose columns; are the total multipoles, translated to GDMA_ORIGIN, and summed. gdma(wfn)[source]¶; Function to use wavefunction information in wfn and, if specified,; additional commands in filename to run GDMA analysis. New in version 0.6. Returns:None. Parameters:; wfn (Wavefunction) – set of molecule, basis, orbitals from which to generate DMA analysis; datafile (string) – optional control file (see GDMA manual) to peform more complicated DMA; analyses. If this option is used, the File keyword must be set to read; a filename.fchk, where filename is provided by WRITER_FILE_LABEL .

In; principle, it should work on any Unix system; however, we have not tested; extensively on systems other than Mac and Linux. There is not a Windows; version of Psi4.; Psi4 has been successfully compiled using Intel, GCC, and Clang; compilers. For the Intel compilers, we recommend at least 12.1 (we have; had trouble with version 12.0 and 13.0.1). GCC version 4.6 or above is; recommended. For some architectures, a precompiled binary is available. See Compiling and Installing for details. Capabilities¶; Psi4 can perform ab initio computations employing basis; sets of contrated Gaussian-type functions of virtually arbitrary; orbital quantum number. Many parts of Psi4 can recognize and; exploit the largest Abelian subgroup of the molecular point group.; Table Methods displays the range of theoretical methods; available in Psi4.; For more details, see Tables Energy,; Energy (DFT), Energy (MRCC),; Energy (CFOUR), Gradient,; Gradient (CFOUR), and Frequency.

Overview¶; Psi4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; Psi4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec. Tutorial provides a brief tutorial to help new users; get started. Section Psithon offers further details into the; structure of Psi4 input files and how Python can be mixed with; quantum chemistry directives in Psi4. Section Psithon Functions; provides more detail on the Python functions provided by Psi4; and discusses some of the higher-level functions such as counterpoise; correction, complete-basis-set extrapolation, and running computations; on an entire database of molecules at a time. Later sections deal with; the different types of computations which can be done using Psi4; (e.g., Hartree–Fock, MP2, coupled-cluster) and general procedures; such as geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis.; The Appendices include a complete description of all possible input; keywords for each module, as well as tables of available basis sets and; a listing of the sample input files available under psi4/samples.; The user is urged to examine this directory of sample inputs, as; most common types of computations are represented there.; For the latest Psi4 documentation, check; www.psicode.org.

Tutorial provides a brief tutorial to help new users; get started. Section Psithon offers further details into the; structure of Psi4 input files and how Python can be mixed with; quantum chemistry directives in Psi4. Section Psithon Functions; provides more detail on the Python functions provided by Psi4; and discusses some of the higher-level functions such as counterpoise; correction, complete-basis-set extrapolation, and running computations; on an entire database of molecules at a time. Later sections deal with; the different types of computations which can be done using Psi4; (e.g., Hartree–Fock, MP2, coupled-cluster) and general procedures; such as geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis.; The Appendices include a complete description of all possible input; keywords for each module, as well as tables of available basis sets and; a listing of the sample input files available under psi4/samples.; The user is urged to examine this directory of sample inputs, as; most common types of computations are represented there.; For the latest Psi4 documentation, check; www.psicode.org.

Overview¶; Psi4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; Psi4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec. Tutorial provides a brief tutorial to help new users; get started. Section Psithon offers further details into the; structure of Psi4 input files and how Python can be mixed with; quantum chemistry directives in Psi4. Section Psithon Functions; provides more detail on the Python functions provided by Psi4; and discusses some of the higher-level functions such as counterpoise; correction, complete-basis-set extrapolation, and running computations; on an entire database of molecules at a time. Later sections deal with; the different types of computations which can be done using Psi4; (e.g., Hartree–Fock, MP2, coupled-cluster) and general procedures; such as geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis.; The Appendices include a complete description of all possible input; keywords for each module, as well as tables of available basis sets and; a listing of the sample input files available under psi4/samples.; The user is urged to examine this directory of sample inputs, as; most common types of computations are represented there.; For the latest Psi4 documentation, check; www.psicode.org.

In; principle, it should work on any Unix system; however, we have not tested; extensively on systems other than Mac and Linux. There is not a Windows; version of Psi4.; Psi4 has been successfully compiled using Intel, GCC, and Clang; compilers. For the Intel compilers, we recommend at least 12.1 (we have; had trouble with version 12.0 and 13.0.1). GCC version 4.6 or above is; recommended. For some architectures, a precompiled binary is available. See Compiling and Installing for details. Capabilities¶; Psi4 can perform ab initio computations employing basis; sets of contrated Gaussian-type functions of virtually arbitrary; orbital quantum number. Many parts of Psi4 can recognize and; exploit the largest Abelian subgroup of the molecular point group.; Table Methods displays the range of theoretical methods; available in Psi4.; For more details, see Tables Energy,; Energy (DFT), Energy (MRCC),; Energy (CFOUR), Gradient,; Gradient (CFOUR), and Frequency.

In; principle, it should work on any Unix system; however, we have not tested; extensively on systems other than Mac and Linux. There is not a Windows; version of Psi4.; Psi4 has been successfully compiled using Intel, GCC, and Clang; compilers. For the Intel compilers, we recommend at least 12.1 (we have; had trouble with version 12.0 and 13.0.1). GCC version 4.6 or above is; recommended. For some architectures, a precompiled binary is available. See Compiling and Installing for details. Capabilities¶; Psi4 can perform ab initio computations employing basis; sets of contrated Gaussian-type functions of virtually arbitrary; orbital quantum number. Many parts of Psi4 can recognize and; exploit the largest Abelian subgroup of the molecular point group.; Table Methods displays the range of theoretical methods; available in Psi4.; For more details, see Tables Energy,; Energy (DFT), Energy (MRCC),; Energy (CFOUR), Gradient,; Gradient (CFOUR), and Frequency.

Overview¶; Psi4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; Psi4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec. Tutorial provides a brief tutorial to help new users; get started. Section Psithon offers further details into the; structure of Psi4 input files and how Python can be mixed with; quantum chemistry directives in Psi4. Section Psithon Functions; provides more detail on the Python functions provided by Psi4; and discusses some of the higher-level functions such as counterpoise; correction, complete-basis-set extrapolation, and running computations; on an entire database of molecules at a time. Later sections deal with; the different types of computations which can be done using Psi4; (e.g., Hartree–Fock, MP2, coupled-cluster) and general procedures; such as geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis.; The Appendices include a complete description of all possible input; keywords for each module, as well as tables of available basis sets and; a listing of the sample input files available under psi4/samples.; The user is urged to examine this directory of sample inputs, as; most common types of computations are represented there.; For the latest Psi4 documentation, check; www.psicode.org.

Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT)¶; Psi4 features an extremely efficient code to perform wavefunction-based; Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). A good review article for this; method is as follows:. “Perturbation Theory Approach to Intermolecular Potential Energy; Surfaces of van der Waals Complexes,” B. Jeziorski, R. Moszynski,; and K. Szalewicz, Chem. Rev. 94, 1887-1930 (1994).; (doi: 10.1021/cr00031a008). Psi4 benefits enormously from the introduction of density fitting (DF); into SAPT. There are several SAPT truncations available in Psi4. For; guidance on which one to choose, see the SAPT section of the manual; and refer to the following systematic study:. “Levels of Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). I. Efficiency and; Performance for Interaction Energies,’’ T. M. Parker, L. A. Burns, R. M.; Parrish, A. G. Ryno, and C. D. Sherrill, J. Chem. Phys. 140,; 094106 (2014).; (doi: 10.1063/1.4867135).

Simmonett, A. Eugene DePrince III, Rollin A. King, and Lori A. Burns; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBEFP; Psi4 contains code to interface to the LIBEFP library developed; in L. Slipchenko’s group by I. Kaliman. LIBEFP at version 1.2.1; is distributed with Psi4 and requires no additional licence,; downloads, or configuration. Conversely, Psi4 cannot build; without LIBEFP. More information about the LIBEFP project; is available at http://www.libefp.org/; and source is hosted at https://github.com/libefp/libefp. EFP Fragments¶; LIBEFP comes with a couple dozen ready-to-use fragments (water, benzene,; common solvents, etc.) listed here; with source psi4/lib/efpfrag. Any of these may be used directly in; a Psi4 input file as described here.; Creating new efp fragments requires the GAMESS quantum chemistry package.; Instructions on building new fragments are here.; Once your new fragment is ready, make it assessible to Psi4 by; including the directory in which the .efp file is located to the colon; separated environment variable PSIPATH. Fragments are searched; for first in the current directory, next in the paths of PSIPATH, and; finally in built-in library. If Psi4 is unable to find the; fragment, an error will be reported. Note; When constructing new fragment files, the name of the name of the; file should be lowercase and have extension .efp. The molecule name; within the file, e.g., $NH3 must correspond to the name of the; fragment file. Molecule Specification¶; EFP fragment geometries are specified alongside the quantum mechanical; (QM) molecule and make use of the -- fragment separation scheme; described here.

Psi4 can also handle mixed; systems of quantum mechanical (QM) and EFP fragments through the native; SCF code augmented by calls to the LIBEFP library. For; example, turning one of the waters in the example above into a QM; fragment is shown below.; molecule {; efp c6h6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; O 4.0 0.0 0.0; H 4.7 0.7 0.0; H 3.3 -0.7 0.0; --; efp h2o -4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; }. set basis 6-31g; energy('scf').

Simmonett, A. Eugene DePrince III, Rollin A. King, and Lori A. Burns; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBEFP; Psi4 contains code to interface to the LIBEFP library developed; in L. Slipchenko’s group by I. Kaliman. LIBEFP at version 1.2.1; is distributed with Psi4 and requires no additional licence,; downloads, or configuration. Conversely, Psi4 cannot build; without LIBEFP. More information about the LIBEFP project; is available at http://www.libefp.org/; and source is hosted at https://github.com/libefp/libefp. EFP Fragments¶; LIBEFP comes with a couple dozen ready-to-use fragments (water, benzene,; common solvents, etc.) listed here; with source psi4/lib/efpfrag. Any of these may be used directly in; a Psi4 input file as described here.; Creating new efp fragments requires the GAMESS quantum chemistry package.; Instructions on building new fragments are here.; Once your new fragment is ready, make it assessible to Psi4 by; including the directory in which the .efp file is located to the colon; separated environment variable PSIPATH. Fragments are searched; for first in the current directory, next in the paths of PSIPATH, and; finally in built-in library. If Psi4 is unable to find the; fragment, an error will be reported. Note; When constructing new fragment files, the name of the name of the; file should be lowercase and have extension .efp. The molecule name; within the file, e.g., $NH3 must correspond to the name of the; fragment file. Molecule Specification¶; EFP fragment geometries are specified alongside the quantum mechanical; (QM) molecule and make use of the -- fragment separation scheme; described here.

Turney; Section author: C. David Sherrill; Psi4 contains an interface to the Molden program. Molden is a; visualization program for electronic structure developed by Gijs Schaftenaar; at the University of of Nijmegen, Netherlands. It is available at; http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/. Molden can; plot atomic orbitals, densities, electrostatic potentials (ESP’s), etc.; Psi4 can create a file containing; atomic coordinates, basis set, and SCF orbital coefficients in the; so-called Molden format. This file is; written by the SCF module (see Section SCF); if the user sets the MOLDEN_WRITE keyword to true. This Molden file is; also used to pass information between Psi4 and WebMO, if Psi4; computations are invoked using the WebMO GUI. The filename of the; Molden file ends in ”.molden”, and the prefix is determined by; WRITER_FILE_LABEL (if set), or else by the name of the output; file plus the name of the current molecule. molden(wfn, filename)[source]¶; Function to write wavefunction information in wfn to filename in; molden format. Will write natural orbitals from density (MO basis) if supplied. New in version 0.5: wfn parameter passed explicitly. Returns:None. Parameters:; wfn (Wavefunction) – set of molecule, basis, orbitals from which to generate cube files; filename (string) – destination file name for MOLDEN file; density_a (psi4.Matrix) – density in the MO basis to build alpha NO’s from (optional); density_b (psi4.Matrix) – density in the MO basis to build beta NO’s from, assumes restricted if not supplied (optional). Examples:. >>> # [1] Molden file for DFT calculation; >>> E, wfn = energy('b3lyp', return_wfn=True); >>> molden(wfn, 'mycalc.molden'). >>> # [2] Molden file for CI/MCSCF computation using NO roots; >>> E, wfn ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/molden-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/molden-1.html
