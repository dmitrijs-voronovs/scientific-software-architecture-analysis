We also released a new WES model that has some minor accuracy improvement. A few important changes in this release:; 1. Changes in the training data for the WGS model:; * Addition:; * 3 replicates of HG001 (PCR+, HiSeqX) provided by DNAnexus; * 2 replicates of HG001 (PCR+, NovaSeq) from BaseSpace public data.; * Removal:; * WES data; (In v0.5.0, we trained our WGS model with WGS+WES data. This time we found that it didn’t help with WGS accuracy, so we removed them); 1. Improved training data labels. See [haplotype_labeler.py](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/r0.6/deepvariant/labeler/haplotype_labeler.py); 1. For direct inputs/outputs from cloud storage, we no longer support direct file I/O (like gs://deepvariant) due to bugs in htslib. Instead we recommend using gcsfuse to read/write data directly on GCS buckets.
