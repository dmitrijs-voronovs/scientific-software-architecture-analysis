It feels more like a Microsoft bug than a GATK one though. It seems crazy that each layer pull has to be a separate web request and there's no batch api for it? Multi layer docker builds are pretty standard from what I understand. . It sounds like your suggestions are talking about 2 slightly different issues to me. 1. Too many layers:. We typically have squashed the GATK docker images, but we recently switched to building our release images with google cloud build. Since squash is *STILL* an experimental feature in docker we've had trouble getting it to work there. Since the size reduction was pretty minimal from squashing we figured it would be ok to not prioritize it. It's definitely possible for us to consolidate various layers in the build. Or manually squash the images. We can take a look for our next release. Wide workflows on azure are something we need to support. 2. Docker size reduction:; I've spend a lot of time looking at this in the past. Our docker image is huge, but it's mostly due to the massive size of our python and R dependencies. I've done a bunch of work reducing temporary files in independent layers and using multiple stages to reduce the size. There's not much low hanging fruit left there. Similarly, moving to alpine is tricky an has limited benefit. GATK packages a number of C libraries which do not work out of the box on alpine due to the different C runtime. (At least that was the case the last time I investigated it a few years ago. ) I suspect there's a way to port things so they work on it, but it's not something we can do now.

I'm not quite sure i fully understand what we can change to help you here. However there is a feature you might not be aware of in the bamout that can help you figure out which reads go with what haplotype. In our bamout we assign a tag (that for whatever reason it looks like IGV hides by default) called the XA tag. If you look at an IGV bamout and color by that tag you can see what reads were grouped by what haplotypes. If a read has no XA tag that means it was non-informative about any one haplotype over a second possible contender and thus it was not strong evidence one way or another. Given that in reality when genotyping we are taking the net likelihoods of all reads vs all haplotypes its somewhat of a simplification to say ""this read comes from that haplotype"" as often reads can be evidence for a number of haplotypes that might get called in aggregate but this simplification works in simple cases.

There are a LOT of differences in the WES results that I'm working on systematically summarizing, but everything I've spot-checked looks reasonable.

I found an issue with the Picard variant calling detail metrics, so I don't trust the PCT_GQ0 values. With our low coverage exome data it makes a pretty significant difference in the unfiltered callrate, so we should point that out in the release notes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8741#issuecomment-2035522652

Pretty darn close to the same (and better than exomes -- we must still be using shorty exome reads? Because of crappy old 1000G data?). Comparing WGS metrics, number of variants went down slightly, (esp. singletons), but that's because of the things buoyed up by GQ0s (value1 is expected, value2 is actual). A few selected metrics:; PCT_DBSNP values differ. Value1: 0.785048 Value2: 0.790694; NOVEL_TITV values differ. Value1: 1.975381 Value2: 1.99816 ; Both good!. PCT_DBSNP_INDELS values differ. Value1: 0.688828 Value2: 0.68689 Changed by -0.0019379854202270508 (relative change of -0.0028134533500118026); Not good, but not bad if it's just 0.28%. For 4.5.0.0, callrate for VQSR-filtered WGS is 100%, i.e. there are no no-calls.

This issue affects GATK versions 4.3.0.0 through 4.5.0.0, and is fixed in GATK 4.6.0.0. The PR with the fix is: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8900. This issue also affects Picard versions 2.27.3 through 3.1.1, and is fixed in Picard 3.2.0. This bug is triggered when writing a CRAM file using one of the affected GATK/Picard versions, and both of the following conditions are met:; ; * At least one read is mapped to the very first base of a reference contig; * The file contains more than one CRAM container (10,000 reads) with reads mapped to that same reference contig. When both of these conditions are met, the resulting CRAM file may have corrupt containers associated with that contig containing reads with an incorrect sequence. . Since many common references such as hg38 have N's at the very beginning of the autosomes and X/Y, many pipelines will not be affected by this bug. However, users of a telomere-to-telomere reference, users doing mitochondrial calling, and users with reads aligned to the alt sequences will want to scan their CRAM files for possible corruption. The other mitigating circumstance is that when a CRAM is affected, the signal will be overwhelmingly obvious, with the mismatch rate typically jumping from sub-1% to 80-90% for the affected regions, making it likely to be caught by standard QC processes.

I honestly don't see the value of doing a full squash, mainly because if we are hosting this in a premium ACR, the limit is 10,000 readOps per minute.

So with 16 layers, you get around 625 pulls per minute. Also, this will be able to still take advantage of parallel pulls (default is 3, but at most 16 threads in this case, I believe) as opposed to one big layer which will not download in parallel. There's the potential of that being a lot slower and subsequent jobs falling into the same ""minute"" because others are not done, making it easier to hit that 10k readOps limit.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147:530,Integrability,mediat,mediated,530,"Hi @Nehir291, please refer to the SVAnnotate tool documentation for definitions of each annotation: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/21905053774363-SVAnnotate. For translocations, PREDICTED_LOF is assigned if a breakpoint falls at any point in the transcript, so an intronic breakpoint would still be annotated as PREDICTED_LOF for any impacted genes. This is because only part of the gene exists on each chromosome after the translocation, which is likely to result in a truncated transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. . Perhaps in some cases this definition is overly permissive, such as if only the UTR or one shorter exon is removed by the translocation - those cases could be worth revisiting. . I hope this helps explain the behavior you are seeing. If this does not fully explain all the PREDICTED_LOF annotations you are observing, please share the CTX breakpoints, the annotations, the SVAnnotate version, and the GTF used so we can investigate further.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147
https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2392219403:0,Deployability,Update,Update,0,"Update: after some offline discussion, we found that this was a two-fold issue that has since been fixed.; 1. END was set to END2 in some older VCFs from GATK-SV, so it represented the breakpoint on the second chromosome rather than the first. This has been fixed - multiple more recent GATK-SV VCFs were found to have the correct values for END for CTX events; 2. Older versions of SVAnnotate annotated the interval CHROM:POS-END for CTX, expecting END to be very close to POS. This produced incorrect intervals when END was set to END2, which could be very large, resulting in long lists of genes under PREDICTED_LOF. This has been fixed in #8693 so SVAnnotate now independently annotates breakpoints at CHROM:POS and CHROM:END for CTX. For other users encountering this issue in their VCFs produced by older versions of GATK-SV, I recommend rerunning CleanVcf and AnnotateVcf with the latest versions of GATK-SV. A more manual alternative that requires less re-running of workflows would be: ; 1. Extract CTX SVs; 2. Set END to POS; 4. Strip out functional consequence annotations; 5. Re-annotate with the latest version of SVAnnotate.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2392219403

Particularly at the end there should be an accounting of how many reads were filtered by what filters. Possibly something is unexpected about the read flags for the STAR aligned reads and most likely they are being filtered out by the tool. You can disable all of the reads filters using this argument `--disable-tool-default-read-filters` and then re-enable the ones that are relevant. Next I would check that your input files are populated and are on the same reference as the -R input that you specified in your command.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8873#issuecomment-2176212771

Your java instance is set with -Xmx45G which will cover most of this limit and leaves only a handful of memory space for the native GenomicsDB library. Native libraries work above the heapsize so it is better for you to set your -Xmx to a more sensible size of 8~12GB and leave rest of the memory space to the native library to use. . Keep in mind that this memory limit on slurm could be set per user not per task therefore you may need to run a single contig at a time or maybe 2 of them simultaneously. Otherwise slurm may interefere with all the tasks and cancel all your jobs. . One final reminder. We strongly recommend users to set the temporary directory to somewhere else other than /tmp. Slurm workload manager interferes with this preference and sometimes results in premature termination of the gatk processes due to deletion of extracted native library and accessory files. .

We were able to recreate this problem in our hands and looks like there is a memory management issue somewhere in the GenomicsDB related code inside GenotypeGVCFs. . Our temporary solution until we make an updated release would be to convert imported genomicsDB instances to GVCF using . `gatk SelectVariants -V gendb://instancename -O GVCF_export.g.vcf.gz -R ref.fa -L whateverintervalusedinGDBimport`. and later using this GVCF file as input for the GenotypeGVCFs tool. This ensures that memory usage won't go above unreasonable levels and won't cause any appearant leaks. . I hope this helps.

This ensures that memory usage won't go above unreasonable levels and won't cause any appearant leaks. . I hope this helps.

The fix here is a little complicated because its a confluence of expected behaviors adding up to this. . Specifically in `-ERC GVCF` mode in HaplotypeCaller we merge adjacent regions with similar `GQ` scores but within those merged reference blocks we track the DP (mean dp) and the MIN_DP. When we go to genotype in GenotypeGVCFs we fall back to Min_DP when reporting the DP since it must be at least that high at the sight in question. For Diploid samples and with the default reference blocking we use, this works fine and for most of the range up to 30+ bases you are able to recover a pretty close approximation of what your DP is in most cases. However for Haploid data the assumptions at play mean that the `GQ` gets very high and starts to max out the field (99) so you end up with extremely long reference confidence blocks with very high confidence and a min_DP of some low value (in your case for the data you shared with us of 4, which is the threshold for hitting GQ=90 in the haploid model). This is also part of why adjusting the intervals for traversal was relevant, as if they were too long they were pulling in bases 1000+ bp away that only have 4fold coverage with reads and torpedoing the reported DP. So far nothing seems to obviously be bugged (we don't test/use haploid calling mode very often so its less well tested and this sort of issue is not surprising). We might be over-confident about reporting `GQ` for haploid reference blocks (though mathematically its sound that you only need a few reference observations to be sure about the ref call). Short of adjusting that model drastically there will always be some threshold where ""after X fold coverage of reads everything is merged into a big adjacent ref block"". Unfortunately with block merging on we never expect the DP to be exact (since it should vary over the block and its expensive to store that information exactly) but the issue is much more pronounced in your haploid s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8943#issuecomment-2318660429

However for Haploid data the assumptions at play mean that the `GQ` gets very high and starts to max out the field (99) so you end up with extremely long reference confidence blocks with very high confidence and a min_DP of some low value (in your case for the data you shared with us of 4, which is the threshold for hitting GQ=90 in the haploid model). This is also part of why adjusting the intervals for traversal was relevant, as if they were too long they were pulling in bases 1000+ bp away that only have 4fold coverage with reads and torpedoing the reported DP. So far nothing seems to obviously be bugged (we don't test/use haploid calling mode very often so its less well tested and this sort of issue is not surprising). We might be over-confident about reporting `GQ` for haploid reference blocks (though mathematically its sound that you only need a few reference observations to be sure about the ref call). Short of adjusting that model drastically there will always be some threshold where ""after X fold coverage of reads everything is merged into a big adjacent ref block"".

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8958#issuecomment-2302656350:461,Performance,cache,cached,461,"Thanks! This is a good question. I had seen it too and looked into it much greater detail now. For Extract (both for VCF and PGEN) the only BigQuery activity that is being recorded is on the `sample_info` table. Each shard in a multi-sharded extract is querying the entire table to get a map of sample id to sample name (excluding withdrawn).

We were able to recreate this problem in our hands and looks like there is a memory management issue somewhere in the GenomicsDB related code inside GenotypeGVCFs. . Our temporary solution until we make an updated release would be to convert imported genomicsDB instances to GVCF using . `gatk SelectVariants -V gendb://instancename -O GVCF_export.g.vcf.gz -R ref.fa -L whateverintervalusedinGDBimport`. and later using this GVCF file as input for the GenotypeGVCFs tool. This ensures that memory usage won't go above unreasonable levels and won't cause any appearant leaks. . I hope this helps.

It's not based on the pileup at the site. So a read that has no quality at a site might still be counted towards that site if it matches the relavent assembled haplotype better than any alternative one during the read scoring phase. . @jamesemery This is the second time in 2 days that we've had questions about this though so it's clearly confusing and maybe not the best solution.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/9014#issuecomment-2432448921
