I think given general `u, v` we need to solve an elliptic equation to find `psi`, eg `lap(psi) = dx v - dy u`. Then the geostrophic buoyancy field is `b = f * dz(psi)`. For some boundary conditions or assumptions of homogeneity, we can possibly simplify this procedure. One could in principle use the conjugate gradient solver to write a fully general utility, though. Hopefully this task will be taken up once the hydrostatic model is operational. Some care must be taken with the geostrophic mode / computation of the geostrophic free surface displacement for the hydrostatic model. Or, given a geostrophic buoyancy field we can integrate in `z` (eg summation of `b * dz`). This would be the intent of `IntegratedField`, but nobody has implemented that yet. Absent those techniques I think the best method for idealized problems is to use a geostrophic streamfunction.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1846#issuecomment-877651839:333,Usability,simpl,simple,333,"To clarify: I think there is utility in a simple example. However, I also recommend using a streamfunction for idealized cases, since its easier to reproduce and understand. Idealized cases with simple geostrophic flows include experiments like the Eady turbulence problem, or LES cases that simulate turbulence in the presence of a simple geostrophic flow. Another class of experiments (likely more prevalent and important than LES around geostrophic flows?) are realistic / quasi-realistic simulations on the sphere initialized from data or complicated buoyancy distributions.

As a question of style, introducing a streamfunction is convenient for those of us that like streamfunctions, but really we're computing the pressure. Since the governing equations that we state for `IncompressibleModel` and `HydrostaticModel` are in terms of pressure, then that might be good as an introductory example. Oceananigans has a pressure solver already. Since the basic profiles that we consider have nonlinear terms, then I wonder if it's possible to use the built in pressure solver to determine `p` and then compute `b` using a derivative operator. Clearly the functionality is there and being able to solve for the pressure of your initial conditions, which is what we're really doing, might be helpful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1846#issuecomment-877699609

I think you can form an AbstractOperation for velocities when the model is constructed, eg:. ```julia; velocities = (u = uh/h, v = vh/h); ```. These can be stored in `ShallowWaterModel.velocities`, and used in kernels. They have a getindex method so they'll work with WENO functions too. This doesn't use any extra memory. AbstractOperations perform the calculation `uh/h` with correct interpolation on the fly. > Just so that I understand, instead of having momentum_flux_huu, advection and transport_tracer_flux_x we should have had something involving the area?

The Bickley jet example was good and we confirmed the growth rates, but perhaps a propagatoing equatorial Rossby wave would be fun. This is an exact solution to the equations and we can ensure that the phase speed matches that with theory. Maybe this would help us to ensure that all the integrals are done correctly.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1872#issuecomment-882572666:180,Usability,clear,clear,180,"> The horizontal convection example with a boundary layer at the top is ideal for a VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid. I'm not sure I agree with this statement though. Just to be clear: I'm not saying I disagree, it's just not obvious to me that that's the case. From the videos in the example the viscous boundary layer seems pretty well-resolved to me (unless you're planning on changing the Pr (or Ra) number?). Plus the turbulence pretty much covers the whole domain, so I don't think we'd want a very coarse grid at the bottom. Is there a metric to look at to gauge the ""resolvedness"" of the viscous boundary layer?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1872#issuecomment-882572666
https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1872#issuecomment-882858629:259,Integrability,depend,depending,259,"Hm... I see both your points. The boundary layer is indeed pronounced in the buoyancy or buoyancy dissipation. But indeed for Ra=1e8 the boundary layer is most probably well-resolved. The boundary layer thickness, however, scales with Ra^{-1/5} or Ra^{-1/4} (depending on the flow regime)... Thus, for the Ra value in the example you are right: no modification is needed. But if one wants to take this up to higher Ra values then higher vertical resolution near the top will help. Perhaps we close this issue (as, I agree, is not really an _issue_ of the code).

Previously we had. ```julia; Statistics.norm(a::AbstractField) = sqrt(mapreduce(x -> x * x, +, interior(a))); ```. `interior(a)` returns a `view` over `parent(a)` that contains only the interior indices. Moreover `GPUArray` recognizes a `view` over a `CuArray` as on the GPU, and thus this function hooks into a special GPU-specific `mapreduce`. But this strategy fails for AbstractOperations, which have no `parent` array. To use GPU-specific code, we have to a) ensure that the output of `mapreduce` is initialized properly through `similar` or b) attempt to use `Base.mapreducedim!` instead. By using `mapreducedim!`, we can ensure GPU-specific code is called by initializing the output. It's a bit silly for the case of 0-dimensional output. Nevertheless, what I've done is initialized a 1-element array, reduced into it, and then output the result, indexing with `CUDA.@allowscalar`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1874#issuecomment-882771196

As for the growth rate plot, in the movies, both cases have an intial perturbation O(1e-3) or so. I can believe this has a norm of O(1e-2). However, initially, the value is much smaller and I'm guessing it's zero. This is probably because we don't compute it at the first index. I will have to look at the plotting script and see why that is. . One easy fix is to start plotting at the second point.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1878#issuecomment-883709160:868,Availability,mainten,maintenance,868,"Those are all possible developments. To put fields in `closure` we have to implement a pattern (implemented for things like boundary conditions, though it's taken a lot of work to get it right) whereby users instantiate a ""template"" `closure`, to which fields / data are added later given knowledge of the grid in the model constructor. Otherwise, users have to provide `grid` as an argument when constructing both a closure and a model. Either pattern is possible --- but implementing a ""template + materialization"" design is complicated, whereas requiring users to provide `grid` when constructing a closure changes the API.

To put fields in `closure` we have to implement a pattern (implemented for things like boundary conditions, though it's taken a lot of work to get it right) whereby users instantiate a ""template"" `closure`, to which fields / data are added later given knowledge of the grid in the model constructor. Otherwise, users have to provide `grid` as an argument when constructing both a closure and a model. Either pattern is possible --- but implementing a ""template + materialization"" design is complicated, whereas requiring users to provide `grid` when constructing a closure changes the API.

The thing is that I think you're way more attentive to the formatting than I am :joy:, so there were some things that I completely missed and others that I saw but thought were fine. . For example the 4-col indentation for arguments, which I didn't know was a thing. The way that Oceananigans indents some stuff (by aligning the equals sign) is very unique and I had never seen it before so I may not have caught all the rules yet.

Sure thing! The example I'm developing this for specifically is a tilted bottom boundary layer. (https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1498). Over there I'm tilting the domain by tilting the gravity vector, really. However, to ""properly"" tilt the domain I'd need to tilt Coriolis too. In this case I'd need a x-component to `f`, which isn't available through `FPlane` or `NonTraditionalFPlane`. Thus, with this addition I'd be able to write something like. ```julia; const θ_rad = 0.2 # radians; const g̃ = (sin(θ_rad), 0, cos(θ_rad)) # domain tilt. buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=g̃) # Tilt gravity vector; coriolis = GeneralFPlane(coriolis_frequency=1e-4, rotation_axes=g̃) # Tilt rotation vector; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1892#issuecomment-886257814

I'd like some feedback there if possible. Arguments now are:. - `coriolis_frequency` (instead of simply `f`). Defaults to `2Ω`; - `rotation_axis` (defaults to `ZDirection`); - `latitude` for convenience (which overwrites `rotation_axis`). I'm a bit unsure if I should keep this one. Maybe we should keep it simple since anyone can figure out `f` based on latitude easily. Questions:. - Should we keep the original `FPlane`?

Yes, when we make the hydrostatic approximation, we assume that the aspect ratio is thin and H/L is small. The hydrostatic assumption specifically refers to the use of this scaling in the vertical momentum equation (reducing it to a diagnostic equation for hydrostatic pressure).

Probably for the future.; > ; > Same could go for run! (e.g. https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/basics/integrator/#Initialization-and-Stepping ) too?. Ah wow, that is epic. I think what's implemented here is more or less analogous to `DiscreteCallback`. Reading over the features there makes me realize that we probably want to ""align"" the time-step (somehow, similar to the root finding feature that's provided for DiffEq) for callbacks. We align time-steps for output, but not for callbacks (yet). That would be nice to add. I think we could also add an analog of the ""continuous callback"" --- to the models, not the simulations --- that's executed during `update_state!`, and therefore can be thought of as a function that ""continuously"" (eg valid at every moment in time) modifies the state of the model. Perhaps `StateModifier` or something like that? These objects would not have a schedule since they'd always be executed. Initialization and finalization might be good wishlist features too for both.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1894#issuecomment-885979847

Excellent, nice results!. Same weird behavior --- the timing is identical from 1 to 2 threads; only at 4 threads do we get speed up (but its by a factor of 1/2 rather than 1/4). With 16 threads the model is 4x faster. Hmm... can we do better?. > Strange that strong scaling looks more monotonic than the weak scaling.

The default `Pr` is `Pr=1` but I suppose one might inadvertently change `Pr` but leave `Cb=1` which would lead to a different LES model than proposed by Lilly (1962). Apparently my explanation wasn't needed! Yes, that's what I mean. I propose we either get rid of `C_b` and just use `1/Pr_t` or make it clear in the docs and docstring that we offer an extra degree of freedom, but that the model as proposed has `C_b=1/Pr_t`.

We had some very early issues with this. Ali may remember. I may not have been around for those tests! Here we're trying a different numerical algorithm that doesn't separate the hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic pressure. The numerics is different this way --- the non-hydrostatic pressure is in some sense treated ""implicitly"" (eg computed at t^{n+1} in order to advance the velocity field from n to n+1). The hydrostatic pressure, before this PR, was computed explicitly, at time-step t^n.

I made the same mistake after reading [Hendrik Ranocha's blog post](https://ranocha.de/blog/Optimizing_EC_Trixi) and seeing. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/128191753-8febcd84-8230-4def-ba80-8aaf848b92a0.png). But this is actually the output of benchmarking on individual components of the time-stepping scheme. I think it'd be a good idea to setup similar microbenchmarks of the time-stepping components (`update_state!`, `calculate_tendencies!`, etc). This is not quite the same as profiling but yields slightly more precise and also more digestible information about timings and relative cost of things per time-step.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-892672795

If you scroll right in my big block of text you can see a column that shows the line number and function name in the file specified in the file column that's visible without scrolling. Please see the full file attached below. Might be easier to view or reformat than the embedded code block above.; [nonhydrostatic_profile_flat.txt](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/files/6931920/nonhydrostatic_profile_flat.txt). I tried to avoid flame graphs and go for something as close to percentages as I could so I went with the default output. I'll add in StatProfilerHTML.jl outputs as well since the flame graphs and html files do look very neat. In the very last row there's a total snapshots count of 24177. Dividing the counts shown in the left-most column by this number should give the percentage time spent on this line or in any functions executed by this line.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-892703448

I don't understand what you're saying, can you say it again a bit differently? My suggestion is to add `KernelFunctionOperation` to this line: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/22bcf3adc2fad0fda6b474aa08a84acd6c461478/src/Oceananigans.jl#L88. and therefore export it when users write `using Oceananigans`.

I think here:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/79676db7707e1f4c4cb7d21b0924562d36b2790f/src/Fields/broadcasting_abstract_fields.jl#L20-L22. Here's how we figure that out. First we use `Meta.@lower` to find the code that runs when we use `.=`:. ```julia; julia> Meta.@lower c .= c0; :($(Expr(:thunk, CodeInfo(; @ none within `top-level scope'; 1 ─ %1 = Base.broadcasted(Base.identity, c0); │ %2 = Base.materialize!(c, %1); └── return %2; )))); ```. Now we can build the operation and use `@which` to figure out what it calls:. ```julia; julia> bc = Base.broadcasted(Base.identity, c0); Base.Broadcast.Broadcasted(identity, ([0.9778532419793966]. [0.5210723026166955],)). julia> Base.materialize!(c, bc). julia> @which Base.materialize!(c, bc); materialize!(dest::Oceananigans.Fields.AbstractField, bc::Base.Broadcast.Broadcasted{var""#s183"", Axes, F, Args} where {var""#s183""<:Base.Broadcast.DefaultArrayStyle, Axes, F, Args<:Tuple}) in Oceananigans.Fields at /Users/gregorywagner/Projects/Oceananigans.jl/src/Fields/broadcasting_abstract_fields.jl:21; ```. The indicated line is the one I've posted.

What is nice about that setup is you can tailor the resources used for each buildkite step just as you would slurm (ex. ""gres:1"" for 1 gpu). You can run jobs on multiple ranks, multiple GPU's, different resource limits, timeouts, etc. basically anything you can pass through to as a cli argument to a slurm batch job is supported. Also it's running on a cluster so obviously your job parallelism is very good.; * `bors r+` trigger merging the PR into `main` branch. This serializes the commits to `main` (and roll-up concurrent PR's to be submitted) so that all merge commits will pass the tests. This is an opportunity to also maybe run more expensive tests (it's easy in buildkite to conditionally run steps if running on `staging` branch) because you'll probably only run the staging CI step one or at most a few times at the very end,. the general strategy is to tier the tests so that they get progressively more expensive and to maximize ci-parallelism to reduce the overall time. @glwagner can control who on the project can submit bors jobs by editing the bors access control settings.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778

Basically, very rare, subtle irregularities have been observed on the GPU when using `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` in a `Periodic, Bounded, Bounded` configuration. I think that it is possible the main issue is an interaction (a read-write race condition) associated with both impenetrable boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions that affects the 8 corner points. The race condition affects model trajectories via the Coriolis force (which is the only term as far as I know that touches the 8 ""corner"" points affected by this race condition). Because the race condition only manifests when a `Coriolis` or `VectorInvariant` stencil touches corner points, it may not affect _most_ `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` models, which could explain why we haven't caught it. The reason it doesn't affect those models is because this race condition would only affect the corner points of `w`, which are not touched when using an `FPlane` Coriolis model. However, it's possible (I'm not sure) that the race condition could affect models using `NonTraditionalFPlane` in `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` configurations. More generally, it will also affect models that are bounded in the `y`-direction, because in those models the corner points of the `y`-velocity are affected and also invoked when using `FPlane` or `BetaPlane` coriolis.

Basically, very rare, subtle irregularities have been observed on the GPU when using `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` in a `Periodic, Bounded, Bounded` configuration. I think that it is possible the main issue is an interaction (a read-write race condition) associated with both impenetrable boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions that affects the 8 corner points. The race condition affects model trajectories via the Coriolis force (which is the only term as far as I know that touches the 8 ""corner"" points affected by this race condition). Because the race condition only manifests when a `Coriolis` or `VectorInvariant` stencil touches corner points, it may not affect _most_ `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` models, which could explain why we haven't caught it. The reason it doesn't affect those models is because this race condition would only affect the corner points of `w`, which are not touched when using an `FPlane` Coriolis model. However, it's possible (I'm not sure) that the race condition could affect models using `NonTraditionalFPlane` in `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` configurations.

Since Tartarus actually has GPUs (we just hide them via an environment variable in CI, e.g. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/.buildkite/pipeline.yml#L77) I can see `CUDA.has_cuda_gpu` returning false (which we want) while `CUDA.has_cuda` would return true (not what we want).

Since it seems that behavior has changed, I think there are some instances of `has_cuda` that should be `has_cuda_gpu` in `src/` that should also be changed.

Right now, we only support two-dimensional Stokes drift, so two-dimensionalization would be fine. In the future it's in principle possible to support Stokes drift with a vertical component, but there are some details regarding divergent Stokes drift fields / divergent Lagrangian-mean velocity fields that would have to be considered.

So I agree that this may not be a huge issue. Although I should mention, it seems that calculation of `AveragedField` is still slower than that of `WindowedSpatialAverage`. I haven't tested this for huge grids yet but for a 128^2 grid the calculation (as per my first example in this issue) goes from around 400 μs to around 60 ms.

I found this reference for the cost of various floating point operations on the CPU:. https://latkin.org/blog/2014/11/09/a-simple-benchmark-of-various-math-operations/. We could reproduce this chart on a GPU with CUDA.jl if we want to provide some useful information to users. I think if we're talking about a _constant_ (the current case), then precomputation hardly harms code complexity (both examples are equally readable to me). Precomputing an _array_ is another story (for example, a forcing function or boundary condition that depends on `sin(x)`). This lesson is definitely not restricted to trigonometric functions or the GPU. The basic principle here is that _there is a trade-off_ between precomputing a potentially expensive operation, and performing it on-the-fly. For constants, precomputation is harmless. For arrays, on-the-fly computation has significant benefits, both for code readability and also possibly for performance (in memory-bound computations). Enlightening users on 1) the existence of this trade-off and 2) how to use benchmarking to find the optimal solution for their problem would probably be useful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2029#issuecomment-952107151

I removed that and hopefully we can still merge this PR since it's a small improvement.

The general way to do this is to make them functions of a ""local smoothness indicator"" <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_r""> which is calculated as such; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_{r} = \sum_{l=1}^k \int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i %2B 1/2}} \Delta x^{2l -1} \left( \frac{\partial^l p_r(x)}{\partial x^l} \right)^2 dx""> .

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2064#issuecomment-971870818:1881,Integrability,depend,depending,1881," we could also omit `Flat` dimensions from the size display, eg. ```julia; ""3-element RectilinearGrid{Float64} on CPU with topology (Flat, Flat, Bounded) and 1-element halo""; ```. ```julia; ""128×128 RectilinearGrid{Float64} on CPU with topology (Periodic, Periodic, Flat) and 1×1 halo""; ```. If we also change `interior` to drop `Flat` dimensions then I think this makes sense (otherwise it might not). In addition to type information, `show` also gives information about _values_. Here this is the extent of the domain and the grid spacings. For example:. ```julia; julia> rand(3, 3); 3×3 Matrix{Float64}:; 0.460633 0.134952 0.0366328; 0.6353 0.0632607 0.0657011; 0.339457 0.720342 0.0417144; ```. for this we can use a tabular display like `domain: x ∈ [1.0, 1.0], y ∈ [1.0, 1.0], z ∈ [0.0, 1.0]`. However, I think a better possibility is to explicitly show the locations of the faces using a strategy similar to how `julia` shows row vectors:. ```julia; julia> collect(reshape(0:0.1:10, 1, 101)); 1×101 Matrix{Float64}:; 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 … 8.9 9.0 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10.0; ```. so we might have, depending on the width of the display:. ```julia; 1×1×101 RectilinearGrid{Float64} on CPU with topology (Flat, Flat, Bounded) and 0×0×1 halo; z faces: [0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 … 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10.0]; ```. etc. Or, putting a ""domain summary"" out front, something like. ```julia; 1×1×101 RectilinearGrid{Float64} on CPU with topology (Flat, Flat, Bounded) and 0×0×1 halo; z ∈ [0.0, 10.0] with faces [0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 … 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10.0]; ```. We can do something similar for spacings, though as others have noted I think it is useful to show _statistics_ rather than list all the values for that case. We probably want to indicate whether we are talking about spacings at Center or Face, so. ```julia; z spacings: stretched with minimum(Δzᵃᵃᶜ) = 0.2, maximum(Δzᵃᵃᶜ) = 0.5; ```. is an option.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2064#issuecomment-971870818

Okay. > I personally still think that's the best solution here. I disagree, because it only solves the problem for a narrow range of checkpointer schedules. If you checkpoint based on `TimeInterval` and check for NaNs based on `IterationInterval`, there is no guarantee that you won't write NaNs to a checkpoint file whether or not the NaNChecker throws an error.
