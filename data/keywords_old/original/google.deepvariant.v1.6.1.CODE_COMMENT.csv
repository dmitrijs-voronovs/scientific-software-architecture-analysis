This is largely ok because (1) the standard; // aligner (BWA) does in fact do consistent left alignment and (2) we anticipate; // feeding this AlleleCounter reads that have been assembled into a consistent; // alignment across all of the reads in a way that is impossible for a read-by-; // read aligner to do. So beware with the aligner you use, unless you've cleaned; // up the reads in some way (left aligning the cigars or just doing assembly).; //; // It is ok to send reads that only partially overlap the interval; the; // AlleleCounter will only add counts from the part that overlap the interval.; //; // This code assumes that the reference genome and the reads have only upper; // case bases. By construction our GenomeReference will not have lower case; // bases. Lower case bases are allowed in read sequences (see; // https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf),; // so it may be worth upper casing the read sequence at some point to make this; // code more robust.; //; // AlleleCounter performs some specialized logic to deal with non-canonical; // bases that might occur in the reference and/or the reads. By canonical we; // mean bases that are one of {A,C,G,T}. The basic constraint is that we will; // not add Allele's that contain non-canonical bases. So if we have a read that; // has (e.g.) an N, we will not produce Allele objects that contain the N. So; // if it doesn't match the reference at a site, it will be skipped as a; // SUBSTITUTION allele, and if it were part of an insertion, that entire; // insertion will be skipped. We do support AlleleCount objects that have a N; // base as its reference base, and those bases get alleles just as a normal base; // would. Downstream processing should look at the reference base of the; // AlleleCounts produced by this code for non-canonical reference bases and; // handle if special handling is needed.

A matching variant is defined here as one that starts at the same position; on the genome as variant. The best match is then narrowed down by finding; the variant with a matching alt allele, if it exists, otherwise the first; matching variant is used regardless of alt alleles. This allows the client; to make decisions on how to translate a matched between variant and; truth_variant into a label (e.g. by comparing the alleles). If multiple variants are detected, this code will attempt to find the best; match by comparing to `variant`. Note that some simplification of alleles; are applied first before we compare. For example, 'GAAA->GAA' should be the; same as 'GA->G'. If no good matches are detected, the logic currently falls; back to the first element in matches.
