Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/340fd55f92f0c8a1da9145d8d126ed441d107868.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/340fd55f92f0c8a1da9145d8d126ed441d107868.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet.

Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?.

If you haven't setup; Conda yet, please do so first and then execute:; conda create -n tutorial mmseqs2 plass megahit prodigal hmmer sra-tools; conda activate tutorial. The generic syntax for mmseqs and plass calls is always the; following:; mmseqs <command> <db1> [<db2> ...] --flag --parameter 42.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; And a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file. MMseqs2 database format, through which all MMseqs2 modules can be easily; and efficiently chained.; The corresponding headers are stored in a separate database with a _h; suffix (plass_proteins_db_h).; The .dbtype file helps to keep track of the database type (amino-acid,; nucleic, profile, etc.).; The .lookup file is a lookup file linking the keys to their sequence; accession as specified in their FASTA header.; The format of this index file is tab-separated and reports one line per; entry in the database, specifying a unique key (column 1), the offset; and the length of the corresponding data (columns 2 and 3 respectively).; As we will make use of the efficient structure later on in the tutorial,; you can already take a look at the index file structure with:; head plass_proteins_db.index. Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 . This creates a cluster database where each entry has the key of its; representative sequence, and whose data consists of the list of keys; of its members:; # the index file contains entries whose; # keys are of those of their representative sequence; head plass_proteins_db_clu.index . # you will see the keys belonging to different clusters; # (one per line) and such that ever",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/490e03b66c6cc106257a2cee0f3d76ced4237d27.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/490e03b66c6cc106257a2cee0f3d76ced4237d27.html

Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/76ba26047392df062942604848f8c70f5b6befab.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/76ba26047392df062942604848f8c70f5b6befab.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins. For this we will use the; Swiss-Prot which is the ",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/76ba26047392df062942604848f8c70f5b6befab.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/76ba26047392df062942604848f8c70f5b6befab.html

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

This; file contains all representative sequences, meaning the sequence that; the algorithm chose as the most representative within this cluster. How many sequences remain now?; How well does this agree with what you expected according to your internet search?.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.

For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster pla",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted.

His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins. For this we will use the; Swiss-Prot which is the m",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/8dddae19b993bf8105caa7929d47f089dfaa41d8.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/8dddae19b993bf8105caa7929d47f089dfaa41d8.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/965fb9a6047ac065a59b10aca91a6a97959493e6.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/965fb9a6047ac065a59b10aca91a6a97959493e6.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen.

We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file. MMseqs2 database format, through which all MMseqs2 modules can be easily; and efficiently chained.; The corresponding headers are stored in a separate database with a _h; suffix (plass_proteins_db_h).; The .dbtype file helps to keep track of the database type (amino-acid,; nucleic, profile, etc.).; The .lookup file is a lookup file linking the keys to their sequence; accession as specified in their FASTA header.; The format of this index file",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/a3f4c6de8e9ee8cc51999d777706ffd1c4695423.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/a3f4c6de8e9ee8cc51999d777706ffd1c4695423.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels.

Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens. Here you will; see the previously mentioned reads.fasta file and a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file. MMseqs2 database format, through which all MMseqs2 modules can be easily; and efficiently chained.; The corresponding headers are stored in a separate database with a _h; suffix (plass_proteins_db_h).; The .dbtype file helps to keep track of the database type (amino-acid,; nucleic, profile, etc.).; The .lookup file is a lookup file linking the keys to their sequence; accession as specified in their FASTA header.; The format of this index file is tab-separated and reports one line per; entry in the database, specifying a unique key (column 1), the offset; and the length of the corresponding data (columns 2 and 3 respectively).; As we will make use of the efficient structure later on in the tutorial,; you can already take a look at the index file structure with:; head plass_proteins_db.index. Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 .

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy.; Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file.

Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 .

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

This; file contains all representative sequences, meaning the sequence that; the algorithm chose as the most representative within this cluster. How many sequences remain now?; How well does this agree with what you expected according to your internet search?. Annotating the proteins; We will look for known protein domains to identify the proteins we; found. Instead of the MMseqs2 command line, we use the MMseqs2; webserver, which will visualize the results. Paste the content of the; FASTA file containing the representative sequences into the webserver; and make sure to select all three target databases (PFAM, PDB,; Uniclust): https://search.mmseqs.com.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/d30a86197dfe7888d9ecd6bccf59725492f62b04.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/d30a86197dfe7888d9ecd6bccf59725492f62b04.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins. For this we will use the; Swiss-Prot which is the ",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/d30a86197dfe7888d9ecd6bccf59725492f62b04.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/d30a86197dfe7888d9ecd6bccf59725492f62b04.html

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

This; file contains all representative sequences, meaning the sequence that; the algorithm chose as the most representative within this cluster. How many sequences remain now?; How well does this agree with what you expected according to your internet search?.

Learn more...; The MMseqs2 Wiki provides further information about other taxonomic modules in MMseqs2 (e.g., creating subdbs of a seqTaxDb) and the various parameter values (e.g., controlling the LCA modes).; Writing large scale sequence analysis workflows; We will show on a human gut metagenomic dataset (SRA run ERR1384114); what the advantages of using Linclust; (linear time clustering algorithm, (Steinegger and Söding 2018)), Plass; (Protein Level Assembly, (Steinegger, Mirdita, and Söding 2018)) and; MMseqs2 are over the more conventional pipeline with MegaHit(Li et al.; 2015), Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010) and HMMER (Eddy 2009).; Analysis of a human gut metagenomics dataset; Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome; We use Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from; the reads, without the nucleic assembly step.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.

The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity.

Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

We will show on a human gut metagenomic; dataset (SRA run ERR1384114) what the advantages of using Linclust; (linear time clustering algorithm, (Steinegger and Söding 2018)), Plass; (Protein Level Assembly, (Steinegger, Mirdita, and Söding 2018)) and; MMseqs2 are over the more conventional pipeline with MegaHit(Li et al.; 2015), Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010) and HMMER (Eddy 2009).; Required software for the tutorial; We will use Conda; to setup all required software for this tutorial.

Analysis of a human gut metagenomics dataset; Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome; We use Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from; the reads, without the nucleic assembly step. It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly. Then extract proteins using Prodigal in metagenomics mode:; prodigal -i megahit_assembly/final.contigs.fa -a prodigal_proteins.fasta -p meta. Take a look at the FASTA files produced by Plass and Prodigal. To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa. Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members. For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster plass_proteins.fasta clustered_proteins tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1.

MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens.

For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster pla",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/de1c4a3224e0bf361e586b9f80ec1f2260ef3dbf.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/de1c4a3224e0bf361e586b9f80ec1f2260ef3dbf.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy.; Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens. Here you will; see the previously mentioned reads.fasta file and a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot. This contains all the reference proteins; from Swiss-Prot which is the manually curated, high-quality part of the; Uniprot(Consortium 2014) protein reference database.

To; filter the result database, we will need the pathogen's numeric; taxonomic identifier. Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name.; What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen?

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?; Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen.; Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet.; We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta.; How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?; Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

Advanced:; instead of just count the reads, sum up the aligned length and; divide it by the contig length apply and awk. The contig length; and alignment length (alnEnd - alnStart) is in the alignment format. We can use createtsv to output the abundances as a TSV formatted file:; # Create a flat file; mmseqs createtsv plassProteinsReduced plassProteinsReduced\; mapAbundances mapAbundances.tsv --target-column 0. Re-create the linclust workflow...; Based on the explanation of the Linclust algorithm, try to code its; workflow using:. kmermatcher. rescorediagonal. clust. Take a look at the real Linclust workflow.; This version is slightly more involved as it integrates a redundancy; reduction step (the pre_clust prefiltering by high Hamming distance),; and uses a trick using filterdb with the flag –filter-file to apply; the workflow you just built only on the non-redundant entries. At; the end of the file, you can also spot a merging step to recover the; redundant part in the final clustering.; Conclusion; We hope that you are more familiar with the MMseqs2 environment, and; that you enjoy its modularity and flexibility for creating new; workflows. Due to time and virtual machine constraints we chose a rather; small metagenomic dataset, but using MMseqs2 on bigger datasets should; convince you of its scalability.; References; Eddy, Sean R. 2009.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi).

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/faf3613f6b6afaf4f5b0f4fabb8c04ea98c90189.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/faf3613f6b6afaf4f5b0f4fabb8c04ea98c90189.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/fde28bd63fd477e8869d2e091150acd21a5dc4f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/fde28bd63fd477e8869d2e091150acd21a5dc4f7.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

Introduction; Metagenomic pathogen detection; Writing large scale sequence analysis workflows. Introduction. Your new friends! MMseqs2 ultra fast and sensitive protein search,; Linclust clustering huge protein sequence sets in linear time and; Plass Protein-level assembly to increases protein sequence recovery; from complex metagenomes.; Here you will learn the basic usage of MMseqs2 as well as expert tricks; to take advantage of the ability of chaining different MMseqs2 modules; to produce custom workflows.; Required software for the tutorials; We will use Conda; to setup all required software for this tutorial. If you haven't setup; Conda yet, please do so first and then execute:; conda create -n tutorial -c conda-forge -c bioconda mmseqs2 plass megahit prodigal hmmer sra-tools; conda activate tutorial. The generic syntax for mmseqs and plass calls is always the; following:; mmseqs <command> <db1> [<db2> ...] --flag --parameter 42. The help text of mmseqs shows, by default, only the most important; parameters and modules. To see a full list of parameters and modules use; the -h flag.; If you are using Bash as your shell, you can activate tab-auto-completion of commands and parameters:; source $CONDA_PREFIX/util/bash-completion.sh.

However, due to the large number; of reads, it is hard to gain insight by skimming the file. MMseqs2; offers a module to summarize the data into a single file report.txt:; mmseqs taxonomyreport uniprot_sprot lca_result report.txt. What is the most common species in this dataset?; Why are there so many different eukaryotic sequences? Were they really; in the spinal fluid sample?. Visualizing taxonomic results; MMseqs2 can also generate an interactive visualization of the data using; Krona (Ondov, Bergman, and Phillippy 2011). Adapt the previous call to; generate a Krona report:; mmseqs taxonomyreport uniprot_sprot lca_result report.html --report-mode 1. This generates a HTML file that can be opened in a browser. This; offers an interactive circular visualization where you can click on each; label to zoom into different parts of the hierarchy.; What is the pathogen?; Look up the following encephalitis causing agents in Wikipedia. Borrelia bacterium. Herpes simplex virus. Powassan virus. West Nile virus. Mycoplasma. Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Based on the literature, which one is the most likely pathogen?; For which species do you find evidence in the metagenomic reads?; Approximately how many reads belong to the pathogen? Based on this; number, how would you determine if it is significant evidence for an; actual presence of this agent?. Investigating the pathogen; We now want to take a closer look only at the reads of the pathogen. To; filter the result database, we will need the pathogen's numeric; taxonomic identifier. Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --tax",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/fde28bd63fd477e8869d2e091150acd21a5dc4f7.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/fde28bd63fd477e8869d2e091150acd21a5dc4f7.html
