https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12852:181,Integrability,message,message,181,"- [x] Checked for duplicates. ### Describe the bug; Calling `Display` on an RDataFrame created from an RNTuple that contains user-defined classes causes ROOT to crash with an error message `No on-disk column information for for field X`, where `X` is a data member of the class in question. Other methods appear to be working correctly, as well as explicitly specifying which data member should be read (i.e. `df.Display({""electrons.pt""})`). ### Expected behavior; Nothing crashes and an `RDisplay` object is returned. ### To Reproduce; Minimal reproducer:; ```c++; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>; #include <ROOT/RNTuple.hxx>; #include <ROOT/RNTupleDS.hxx>; #include <ROOT/RNTupleModel.hxx>. #include <iostream>. using ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleModel;; using ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleWriteOptions;; using ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleWriter;. const std::string kNTupleName = ""N"";; const std::string kNTupleFileName = ""ntuple_electrons.root"";. struct Electron {; float pt = 0;; };. void write() {; auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto fldElectrons = model->MakeField<Electron>(""electrons"");. auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate(std::move(model), kNTupleName, kNTupleFileName);. fldElectrons->pt = 42.;; ntuple->Fill();; }. void read() {; auto df = ROOT::RDF::Experimental::FromRNTuple(kNTupleName, kNTupleFileName);; auto dfDef = df.Define(""ptSquared"", ""electrons.pt * electrons.pt"");. dfDef.Describe().Print();. auto dfDisp = df.Display();; dfDisp->Print();; }. void ntuple_rdf_custom_class() {; write();; read();; }; ``` . ### Setup; 1.

Now, 2 years ago [I proposed to reserve ""_build""](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8009) in .gitignore as a simple build directory name that we could use. That PR was closed in favor of [removing the ""build"" directory](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8031) from ROOT's sources and use that name instead. Since then I have been naming my build directories something that the current .gitignore would ignore: `cmake-build-foo` or similar. I realize it might seem silly, but it would be a non-negligible quality of life improvement for me if I could just use `cmake-build` instead, hence this PR (while we wait for #8031).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12881

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12914:167,Integrability,depend,dependent,167,"back port of https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863. This problem appears ""only"" in newer OS/compiler (as seen in the original reports leading to #12715) the dependent library are now dlclose'd when the 'main' library is dlclose'd. In the example a cmake generated library is linked against `libHist` and `libHist` is then loaded and unloaded when the example's library is (intentionally) loaded and unloaded. `libHist` happens to share a STL collection's dictionary (`std::vector<TString>`) with `libCore` (and this collection is used for the reading of rootpcm files and thus during the loading of the example's library). . Details:. Unload only the TClass actually generated by the unloaded library. The TGenericClassInfo's destructor now passes the TClass that they actually generated in; addition to the name so that only that TClass is destroyed. This avoid the problem (seen in #12715) where 2 librares (`A` and `B`) have a dictionary for the same; STL collection (this is supported) and we have the following sequence of operation:. 1. load library A; 2. load library B (dictionary registration is ignored as intended); 3. request TClass for STL collection.; 4. unload (dclose) library B; 5. use TClass for STL collection.

As stated in the [forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/extracting-global-correlation-causes-a-seg-fault-with-sumw2error/55138/3), the global correlation coefficients are defined as; $`\rho_k^2 = 1 - [V_{kk} * (V^{-1})_{kk}]^{-1}`$,; so the corrected correlation coefficients could be defined as; $`(\rho_{corr})_k^2 = 1 - [(V_{corr})_{kk} * (V_{corr}^{-1})_{kk}]^{-1}`$. ### Describe alternatives you've considered. At the very least, calling `RooFitResult::globalCorr` should raise a sensible error instead of causing a seg fault. ### Additional context. More generally, it would be nice if RooFit printed the corrected matrix instead of (or after) the uncorrected one at the end of the fit. At present, one sees a long list of parameter updates printed, but the errors and correlations in the final one printed differ from those stored in the `RooFitResult`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12935

It is not possible to operate on a HistFactory Measurement object in a workspace created with ROOT 6.26 by using ROOT 6.28. Attempting to do so results in the following:; ```; Error in <TRint::HandleTermInput()>: std::length_error caught: basic_string::_M_replace_aux; ```. The opposite scenario (workspace created in 6.28, using 6.26 to read it) also causes issues.

In an ongoing development we have an external pulled into a header (SYCL related); that header has a static variable. JITting that header triggers static initialization which need the library to be loaded to resolve the symbol. That library doesn't get loaded when generating module.idx causing a missing symbol.

When trying to draw a histogram with a transparent box on top of it, I noticed that whenever I set `CanvasPreferGL` to `true`, the canvas moves down, and the X-axis title is cut off. ### What is the expected behaviour?. The only change I would expect is the transparency introduced to my box. Things are not supposed to be moved around only due to; ```c++; gStyle->SetCanvasPreferGL(true);; ```. ### How to reproduce?. Consider this macro:. ```c++; void transpar(); {; gStyle->SetCanvasPreferGL(false);. TH2F *h = new TH2F(""h"", ""h;X;Y;Z"", 10, 0., 10., 10, 0., 10.);; h->Draw();. TMarker *m = new TMarker(4., 7., 8);; m->Draw();. TBox *b = new TBox(1., 1., 8., 8.);; printf(""CanvasPreferGL is set to %s\n"", gStyle->GetCanvasPreferGL() ? ""true, the red box is expected to be transparent"":""false, the red box is expected to be non-transparent"");; b->SetFillColorAlpha(kRed, 0.2);; b->Draw();; }; ```. Now if I run this as; ```; root -l -n transpar.cxx; ```; I get the following:; ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/7541582/446db1cf-b73e-4809-b5f7-dfb422934db3). (no transparency is expected, so it is all good).; But when I change `false` to `true` at the third line; ```c++; gStyle->SetCanvasPreferGL(true);; ```; and run again; ```; root -l -n transpar.cxx; ```; , I get; ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/7541582/e88d31f5-e46e-487b-bf37-8779ab8ef2d3). The box is now transparent, which is good, but there is too much empty space above the histogram name (“`h`”) and, as a consequence, the X-axis title is now cut off. Is there a way to make my box transparent and keep everything else where it was before?. Please note I’m using the `-n` option when running `transpar.cxx`, so it’s not due to something I have in my style file.

The issue is observed only via SSH (from e.g. `lxplus7`); - in principle, the issue can be mitigated by adding the following five lines at the very end of the macro (right after `b->Draw();`; the transparency remains; the +/- 0.1 offsets need a bit of a tuning of course):; ```c++; if (gStyle->GetCanvasPreferGL()); {; gPad->SetBottomMargin(gPad->GetBottomMargin() + 0.1);; gPad->SetTopMargin(gPad->GetTopMargin() - 0.1);; }; ```. ### ROOT version. 6.28/00. ### How did you install ROOT?. provided by ATLAS @ lxplus7. ### Which operating system are you using?.

That's great and fixes HistFactory for non-uniform binnings, but it is; not optimal for the `BinnedLikelihood` code path. Here, the bin widths; need to multiplied back again to get the event yields in each bin.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13035:1287,Performance,concurren,concurrently,1287,"### Explain what you would like to see improved. In CMSSW we want to have dictionaries defined explicitly for all classes that are part of I/O. Occasionally some things slip through causing (sometimes?) ROOT to try to auto parse the header of the corresponding class. Many times the auto parsing works (but is not desirable), in some cases it fails with an unhelpful error message (in most cases so far this has been in conjunction with CUDA, by rootcling being unable to write to the `cuda.pcm` that is in cvmfs). With auto parsing disabled, we'd be able to emit an error message pointing to the class whose dictionary is missing. I gave a try on `TInterpreter::SetClassAutoparsing(false)` in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41344, and while in specific cases I got the desired behavior (of CMSSW framework emitting a descriptive error message for a missing dictionary instead of ROOT trying to auto-parse the corresponding header), the fact that the `SetClassAutoparsing()` is a global setting makes it difficult to disable the auto parsing in a useful way in the concurrent setup of CMSSW. There are a few cases (like open ROOT file, set up a string cut parser that uses ROOT reflection underneath) where the auto-parsing needs to be enabled, and these activities may be running concurrently to activities where I'd like to have the auto-parsing disabled. ### Share how it could be improved. Make the auto parsing setting more fine grained, e.g. explicitly in the relevant API calls or as a `thread_local`. Being able to query the value of the setting could be useful as well. ### How to reproduce?. A recipe to reproduce can be cooked up if necessary based on https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41344. ### ROOT version. 6.26. ### How did you install ROOT?.

Something goes wrong in the code generation for a lot of tests, this case is roottest-root-meta-evolution-data1-build; for some reason the first entry from the list of available elf objects ([vdso]) makes it to the generated command line (and because it is not a path, I imagine, something get's thrown off).

Something goes wrong in the code generation for a lot of tests, this case is roottest-root-meta-evolution-data1-build; for some reason the first entry from the list of available elf objects ([vdso]) makes it to the generated command line (and because it is not a path, I imagine, something get's thrown off).

This requires 3 extra function evaluations per derivative, but is necessary in the case of minima where there is high curvature (in the case of high stats) and the forward finite difference (default) behaviour leads incorrectly to a non-positive-definite covariance matrix; * Return the uncorrected covariance matrix, even if it is not positive definite. This useful for checking just how far from positive-definiteness the matrix is by being able to examine the eigenvalues. . Additionally, a lower bound on the precision allowed for the spread of eigenvalues of the ""hessian"" correlation matrix (computing a correlation matrix with the hessian as if it was a covariance matrix) was reduced from 1e-6 to 1e-12 (see MnHesse.cxx) ... it is not clear why 1e-6 was the lower bound previously, but current machine precision can beat that (I get locally 1e-8). I left a comment about whether this lower bound should be made configurable or not... This new strategy was tested with a model with high statistics (almost 50 million events) where the migrad minimization was successful but the hessian was being forced positive definite. With this new Strategy 3 the hessian is accurate and positive definite in all cases tested.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13109

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13142:336,Availability,error,errors,336,"### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. The issue arises under the following circumstances:; - The overall Probability Density Function is constructed using HistFactory.; - The Beeston Barlow Lite method is employed, thus `ActivateStatError()` is used, leading to a series of constrained `gamma_stat` errors.; - `HistFactorySimultaneous` is used (this bug does not occur if HistFactorySimultaneous is not used). The main problem surfaces **when executing MINOS, which alters the gamma parameter values (`gamma_stat_[...]`)**, contrary to our expectation that they should remain unmodified. To summarize, if the model is built using `HistFactory` as shown in the following code:; ```cpp; #include ""RooStats/HistFactory/Measurement.h""; #include ""RooStats/HistFactory/MakeModelAndMeasurementsFast.h""; #include ""RooStats/HistFactory/HistFactorySimultaneous.h""; using namespace RooFit;; using namespace RooStats;; using namespace HistFactory;. // Build the model; Measurement meas(""meas"", ""meas"");; // [...]; // [...]; RooWorkspace *w = MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; RooStats::ModelConfig *mc = (RooStats::ModelConfig*) w->obj(""ModelConfig"");; RooSimultaneous* model = (RooSimultaneous*)mc->GetPdf();; HistFactorySimultaneous* model_hf = new HistFactorySimultaneous( *model );. // Minimisation; RooAbsReal* nll_hf=model_hf->createNLL(*data, Offset(kTRUE));; RooMinimizer *minuit = new RooMinimizer(*nll_hf);; minuit->setOffsetting(kTRUE);; minuit->setStrategy(1);; minuit->migrad();. // Run MINOS on the parameter of interest; minuit->minos(*parameter_of_interest);; ```; Then, the execution of MINOS in the final line results in the modification of the values of the `gamma_stat` parameters. ### Reproducer.

This is because ```createCI()``` throws an error about a non-existing clang resource directory inside the cling directories and a crash occurs shortly afterwards, when a code to be interpreted is entered. The reason of the above seems to be the inability of cling and its build system to flag properly that there is no built-in LLVM/clang and therefore cling should use the external one instead. This PR fixes it by introducing the ```LLVM_PATH``` pre-processor definition which is populated automatically by CMake with the detected LLVM directory as soon as both ```builtin_llvm``` and ```builtin_clang``` are off.

(See: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/merge_requests/1028). As it happens, this didn't solve our original issue with an older version of [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB), but that I did not manage to reproduce with a standalone example yet, so let's ignore that one for now. (You can find some more info in: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/-/merge_requests/64172). But one issue that I found during this development is fairly easy to reproduce. It seems that one can not provide `-isystem` and `-D` command line options to `genreflex` in any order. Specifying `-D` flags after `-isystem` flags seems to not work. ### Reproducer.

In order to try to silence some warnings coming from ""externals"" during dictionary generation for our classes (where our types would publicly depend on externals that themselves generate some warning), we just now started to teach our build system to provide include paths separately with `-I` and `-isystem` to the dictionary generation commands. (See: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/merge_requests/1028). As it happens, this didn't solve our original issue with an older version of [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB), but that I did not manage to reproduce with a standalone example yet, so let's ignore that one for now. (You can find some more info in: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/-/merge_requests/64172). But one issue that I found during this development is fairly easy to reproduce. It seems that one can not provide `-isystem` and `-D` command line options to `genreflex` in any order. Specifying `-D` flags after `-isystem` flags seems to not work. ### Reproducer.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13219:199,Integrability,wrap,wrappers,199,"As discussed in the last I/O meeting, the current RFieldBase API for reading and writing is flawed. The `RFieldBase::Read()` and `RFieldBase::Append()` methods take `RFieldValue` parameters, as thin wrappers around the target/source memory location. This is a misuse of the `RFieldValue` class and does not provide any additional benefit. This PR changes the RFieldBase read/write APIs to use void pointers instead. It applies a similar change to the underlying `RColumn` read/write API (note that `RColumn` is supposed to be an internal API. NB: it still needs to move from `ROOT::Detail` to `ROOT::Internal`). In a follow-up PR, the following change is foreseen:; - Make `RFieldValue` an inner class of `RFieldBase`, i.e. `RFieldBase::RValue`; - Make `RFieldBase::Read()` and `RFieldBase::Append()` protected; - Call the `RFieldBase` read/write API only through `RFieldBase::RValue`; ; This would prevent random memory locations from using the RField read/write API. Only memory locations that come from a certain field (e.g., created by that field) will use the RField read/write API.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13219

Instead, the builds of the new CI state they are running the DistRDF tests and they also pass. ```; 2410/2429 Test #1573: roottest-python-distrdf-dask-test_all ............................................................. Passed 127.24 sec; ```. Which is evidently wrong. One possible reason behind this is that the new CI runs on incremental builds and it's possible that Python files are not properly copied over after the changes. ### Reproducer.

In a non-C++-modules build, `TClassEdit::ResolveTypedef()` is unable to resolve a typedef that aliases a fundamental data type. However, given a non-static class member of the same type, `TDataMember::GetTrueTypeName()`, correctly provides the expected information. This seems to be inconsistent behavior in ROOT meta. ### Reproducer. For instance, consider the `typedef` and `struct` declarations below.; ```c++; namespace SG { typedef uint32_t sgkey_t; }. struct PackedParameters {; SG::sgkey_t m_sgkey;; };; ```. In this case, the return value of `ResolveTypedef()` / `GetTrueTypeName()` is inconsistent as shown below. ; ```c++; root [1] TClassEdit::ResolveTypedef(""SG::sgkey_t""); (std::string) ""SG::sgkey_t""; root [2] auto klass = TClass::GetClass(""PackedParameters"");; root [3] auto member = klass->GetDataMember(""m_sgkey"");; root [4] member->GetFullTypeName(); (const char *) ""SG::sgkey_t""; root [5] member->GetTrueTypeName(); (const char *) ""unsigned int""; ```. ### ROOT version. master. ### Installation method. build from source. ### Operating system.

To summarize:; - `ShapeFactor` can have init values for its nuisance parameters; - The documentation for `ShapeFactor` indicates settings both for reading/writing the initial shape (see `fhHigh` in the [source code](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/28c5ade5377bfb6b9025b79aa404d5270516af3c/roofit/histfactory/inc/RooStats/HistFactory/Systematics.h#L251)); - `ShapeFactor` inherits from `HistogramUncertaintyBase` which allows setting of some common attributes such as `HistoName` and `HistoPath` and `InputFile`. I can write valid code (in python, but assumed to be about the same as in C++) to create a valid `Measurement` that ROOT is happy with, however it is not serializable. ### Reproducer. Using the attached `data/data.root` which contains the histogram already with init values, you can run the following python code mainly inspired from the [hf001_example.C](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/hf001__example_8C.html) example:. ```python; import ROOT; from ROOT.RooStats import HistFactory as HiFa; Measurement = HiFa.Measurement; Sample = HiFa.Sample; Channel = HiFa.Channel.

I tried to run std::stable_sort on a TTreeReaderArrray. The sorting works fine on macOS, but a colleague tried to run the same code on Ubuntu and reported a crash. I then managed to reproduce the crash on CentOS 7. I investigated the error, and it seems that std::stable_sort assumes that it can decrement and invalid pointer to get a pointer to the last array of an element. However, TTreeReaderArray invalidates the iterator by setting fArray=0 when fIndex is incremented to fIndex>=fSize. This means that the information about the associated array is lost, and the subsequent decrement and dereference will fail. I would assume this could be fixed by marking an invalid iterator with a special value for fIndex (instead of setting fArray=0). So my question would be if TTreeReaderArray is supposed to be sortable, or if I am trying something that's outside of the scope of the implementation?. I know my reproducer requires ALICE O2. ### Reproducer. I encountered the bug with a tree that holds classes from the ALICE O2 framework.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13316:42,Modifiability,variab,variables,42,"The RooFit plotting did not work well for variables of small orders of; magnitude, because there was a hardcoded check with an absolute value to; see if two points are considered the same: `x2 - x1 < 1e-20`. If this; condition is true, the point at x2 was not plotted. This meant that some; points that were actually different were skipped. The fix is to change this condition to a relative one, considering xmin; and xmax. The code to generate sampling hints for histograms was also; moved inside RooCurve, such that it's easier to syncronize the relevant; magic constants. Here is a demo of a plot that didn't work before but now works:. ```C++; void repro(); {. int nBins = 4;. double scale = 1e-31;. double xmin = 0. * scale;; double xmax = 1. * scale;; double binWidth = (xmax - xmin) / nBins;. // Fill the bin boundaries; std::vector<double> binBoundaries(nBins + 1);; for (int i = 0; i <= nBins; ++i) {; binBoundaries[i] = i * binWidth;; }. // The RooParametricStepFunction needs a TArrayD; TArrayD step_edges{int(binBoundaries.size()), binBoundaries.data()};.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13338:955,Availability,error,error,955,"### Check duplicate issues. - [ ] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Hello, . I am creating this issue because there is a bug when setting an entry list that has already been used to a `TTree`.; The entry number returned by `tree->GetEntryNumber(index)` are messed up until that function is called 2 times in a row for the same index. You can find a standalone simple reproducer of the bug below. . In that code by setting `numTest` to `0`, `1` or `2` you will obtain the different print below. ; With that example by calling `tree->GetEntryNumber(index)` it should return the value `index` ; e.g. `tree->GetEntryNumber(2)` should return `2`. However until the `GetEntryNumber()` function has not been called 2 times for the same index then the returned entry number is NOT the expected one. . Here it is simple to solve the issue i.e. not call `entryList->GetEntry(15);` before setting the entry list to the tree ; but I find this behaviour really error prone as one would need to be sure the entry list has never been used basically. .

How hard would it be to implement a class (somehow) deriving from histogram classes, but showing in the TBrowser UI some sort of a complex histogram ?. Current state: I have histograms storing Re and Im parts of a complex signal for instance.; This goes currently in TBrowser as:; ```; my.root; -> TH1D* : histogram[Re]; -> TH1D* : histogram[Im]; -> TH1D* : histogram[Ph]; -> TH1D* : histogram[Mag]; ```. I would like to display something like:; ```; my.root; TComplexH1D* ; |; --> Re (TH1D); --> Im (TH1D); --> Ph (TH1D); --> Mag (TH1D); ```. This wouldn't simply be a class with 4 histograms inside, I don't want to spread histograms everywhere in my rootfiles, but represent this object as a single key and still be able to open it and look inside.. ### Alternatives considered. _No response_. ### Additional context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13352

Hi, the documentation for `getPropagatedError` contains a mistake in the definition of the error propagation formula as far as I can tell. In the current definition of the master version, the calculation uses the covariance matrix, but defines a function `F` to not be a slope to approximate a derivative, but instead the average variation of `f`. When using the covariance matrix, the definition of `F` should include a `da` in the denominator. Alternatively, the definition of the propagation should use the correlation matrix with `F` unchanged. The same version of the formula is used in the 6.24 docs. The 6.22 docs contain a version that uses the correlation matrix (with `F` unchanged), but misses a square on the uncertainty (this was since fixed).

Hi, the documentation for `getPropagatedError` contains a mistake in the definition of the error propagation formula as far as I can tell. In the current definition of the master version, the calculation uses the covariance matrix, but defines a function `F` to not be a slope to approximate a derivative, but instead the average variation of `f`. When using the covariance matrix, the definition of `F` should include a `da` in the denominator. Alternatively, the definition of the propagation should use the correlation matrix with `F` unchanged. The same version of the formula is used in the 6.24 docs. The 6.22 docs contain a version that uses the correlation matrix (with `F` unchanged), but misses a square on the uncertainty (this was since fixed). I could be wrong in my math of course, so please ensure I am not misunderstanding something here. master: https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsReal.html#a4d7678837410aabcd93e6f0937de525b (uses covariance); 6.24: https://root.cern.ch/doc/v624/classRooAbsReal.html#a8ea9118e0ca9578fee21443e919fa3c0 (uses covariance); 6.22: https://root.cern.ch/doc/v622/classRooAbsReal.html#a8ea9118e0ca9578fee21443e919fa3c0 (uses correlation). In addition to this, the formula rendering is broken for me for this function in 6.22+ documentation (MacOS, tested on Firefox/Safari/Chrome). ![Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 17 20 58](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/45009355/1f192cd6-1dee-4772-8b63-90b449a33acb).

We ran into some trouble last night with the ROOT ""HEAD"" builds that have CUDA enabled in our LCG nightlies.

Once the ""edit in viewer"" option is checked, the clip box can be moved with the mouse, but still only along one axis, not along the other two.

As requested by the user on the forum (https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/rdataframe-feature-request-per-sample-histo-graph-fill-and-filter/), a FilterPerSample feature would improve and simplify physics analysis when a single RDataFrame with multiple samples is used. . There is an additional suggestion from the user concerning ""an option to expose the RSampleInfo object as a default RDataFrame column (in the same way as rdfentry_ and rdfslot_), maybe “rdfsample_” "". . ### Alternatives considered.

As requested by the user on the forum (https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/rdataframe-feature-request-per-sample-histo-graph-fill-and-filter/), a FilterPerSample feature would improve and simplify physics analysis when a single RDataFrame with multiple samples is used. . There is an additional suggestion from the user concerning ""an option to expose the RSampleInfo object as a default RDataFrame column (in the same way as rdfentry_ and rdfslot_), maybe “rdfsample_” "". . ### Alternatives considered.

All tests used a Release `-O3` build, 40M entries and 505 compression; results in $us$, averaged over 10 executions. _(i)_ 4 fields of type `std::uint32_t`:; ```; | Average | Rel. increase; ---------------------------+-----------+--------------; BASE | 871502.4 |; No callbacks [1] | 867523.1 | 0.9954; No callbacks [1][2] | 878027.7 | 1.0075; 1 callback | 1068704.3 | 1.2263; 2 callbacks | 1233821.7 | 1.4157; ```; _(ii)_ 2 fields of type `std::uint32_t` + 2 user-defined structs:; ```; | Average | Rel. increase; ---------------------------+-----------+--------------; BASE | 2500244.7 |; No callbacks [1] | 2688342.6 | 1.0752; No callbacks [1][2] | 2746363.6 | 1.0984; 1 callback | 2883271.0 | 1.1532; 2 callbacks | 3016407.0 | 1.2064; ```. As noted in test _(ii)_ for 'No callbacks [1]', non-simple fields have an overhead due to the additional branch. Still, the change in this PR is beneficial. ## Checklist:; - [x] tested changes locally",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13487

After having tried many combinations of ROOT and ubuntu versions, finally it worked with ROOT 6.12.06 on Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS (gcc 5.4.0). .

Indeed I used the TMapFile together with TApplication to realize the online monitoring for my DAQ. After having tried many combinations of ROOT and ubuntu versions, finally it worked with ROOT 6.12.06 on Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS (gcc 5.4.0). . The main problem is remaining with the TMapFile which requires -lNew to be included in the makefile. Once this works, the TApplication just doesn't work with error message of segmentation fault or violation. Or vice versa, TApplication works but TMapFile doesn't work. In order to repeat the errors, I collected the three ROOT example macros (as attached) and created a makefile to compile them. In the Makefile, the option of --new or -lNew have been added. One can include them or comment them out. On Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (gcc 9.4.0), with ROOT version from 6.12.06 to 6.28.04, none of the combinations got to work.
