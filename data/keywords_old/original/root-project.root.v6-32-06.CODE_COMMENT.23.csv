When the flag is set to lenient, both irregular; sequences and isolated surrogates are converted. Whether the flag is strict or lenient, all illegal sequences will cause; an error return. This includes sequences such as: <F4 90 80 80>, <C0 80>,; or <A0> in UTF-8, and values above 0x10FFFF in UTF-32. Conformant code; must check for illegal sequences. When the flag is set to lenient, characters over 0x10FFFF are converted; to the replacement character; otherwise (when the flag is set to strict); they constitute an error. Output parameters:; The value ""sourceIllegal"" is returned from some routines if the input; sequence is malformed. When ""sourceIllegal"" is returned, the source; value will point to the illegal value that caused the problem. E.g.,; in UTF-8 when a sequence is malformed, it points to the start of the; malformed sequence. Author: Mark E.
