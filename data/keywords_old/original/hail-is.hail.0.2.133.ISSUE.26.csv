The crux of such a change is any CreateDatabase steps should use the `database-server-config` from *its own namespace* (which will come in the PR that uses this step) and not from default. There's no cleanup step required because this will be used to create DBs inside the namespace for the pipeline, so resources will get cleaned up with the namespace. The other changes in this step bring the configuration for `dev` scopes closer to that of `test` scopes, because creation of test databases should really just be idempotent and there shouldn't be a difference between deploying a database in dev and test.

The areas of change are as follows:. ### Generation of the namespace's database-server-config; The current approach in main does a little trick. Since the current `createDatabase` step uses the `database-server-config` from default to generate admin/user sql configs, the CI pipeline creates a dummy database `test-database-instance` to create a `sql-test-instance-admin-config` that inherits the credentials from the production `database-server-config`, and then copies that within the test namespace to `database-server-config`. In this change, since we are creating the server ourselves, we can just replace these with a step that creates a `database-server-config` from scratch, and then uses that for the DB pod. Overall making these changes really gave me the heebie jeebies that the test and dev namespaces have all these credentials to the CloudSQL server. I'm glad this gets rid of that. ### Accessing the database server; We use the DB pod's service DNS name as the `host` so inside Kubernetes this Just Works. The one caveat is the CI pipeline in which we run migrations in batch jobs. Those jobs need a way to reach the DB pod. I achieve this with a NodePort and then use the job's K8s credentials to resolve the node and port that the DB is on. The code I've added to do this resolution feels a bit janky, wouldn't mind some feedback on that. In terms of security, if a user job was able to somehow resolve the address of a test db, they would still not have the credentials to access it, and this is currently also the case with the production database. Nevertheless, this does raise an action item that we should only allow traffic to the k8s and DB subnets for `network=private` jobs, but I think we should make that a separate PR. ### Database creation; In order to test this properly in a dev deploy, I needed to make some changes to `create_database.py`.

This way we can make backwards incompatible changes between the worker and driver without having to manually kill the whole fleet. This will allow pre-existing workers to finish gracefully, as they will just stop receiving work when the new batch driver is deployed and eventually die off. ### Scheduler changes; Just skips instances where the instance version doesn't match `INSTANCE_VERSION`. ### Autoscaler changes; Cluster stats like free mcpu and live instances are tracked per instance version. The autoscaler now only looks at instances of the latest version when deciding whether it needs more workers.

This PR resolves/clarifies two issues we encountered. 1) Storage Account Name Uniqueness. Due to Azure's restrictions on storage account naming (mainly that names must be globally unique) the redeploy did not succeed. This is because the resource group name (we chose to reuse hail) is possible under a new subscription, but the generated storage account names were therefore identical to our previous stack. I've added in an argument called `storage_account_suffix` to account for this issue. It can be set to any arbitrary string that complies with Azure's storage account naming scheme in order to avoid naming conflicts in the future. While the option remains to simply choose a novel resource group name this is not enforced by Azure and anyone deploying a stack similarly named to someone else would not know until the `terraform apply` stage that the name would not work. 2) Mysql Flexible Server Zones. The only other issue is that the zone argument for the mysql flexible server is no longer always valid depending on your compute region.

All the comments on the earlier PR are responded to there and addressed in the code for this one. This PR is to enable `hail-az/https` Azure file references to contain SAS tokens to enable bearer-auth style file access to Azure storage. Basic summary of the changes:; - Update `AzureAsyncFS` url parsing function to look for and separate out a SAS-token-like query string. Note: made fairly specific to SAS tokens - generic detection of query string syntax interferes with glob support and '?' characters in file names; - Added `generate_sas_token` convenience function to `AzureAsyncFS`. Adds new azure-mgmt-storage package requirement.; - Updated `AzureAsyncFS` to use `(account, container, credential)` tuple as internal `BlobServiceClient` cache key; - Updated `AzureAsyncFSURL` and `AzureFileListEntry` to track the token separately from the name, and extend the base classes to allow returning url with or without a token; - Update `RouterFS.ls` function and associated listfiles function to allow for trailing query strings during path traversal; - Update `AsyncFS.open_from` function to handle query-string urls in zero-length case; - Change to existing behavior: `LocalAsyncFSURL.__str__` no longer returns 'file:' prefix. Done to make `str()` output be appropriate for input to `fs` functions across all subclasses; - Updated `InputResource` to not include the SAS token as part of the destination file name; - Updated `inter_cloud/test_fs.py` to generically use query-string-friendly file path building functions to respect the new model, where it is no longer safe to extend URLs by just appending new segments with `+ ""/""` because there may be a query string, and added `'sas/azure-https'` test case to the fixture.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13173:433,Testability,test,tests,433,"Using URL parsing for object storage URIs has proven problematic as they don't really have the same syntax. In particular, Java URI truncates the path at `?` and assigns the rest to a query string field (as it should), but `?` is a valid character in a blob storage object and is used as a glob pattern. We were forgetting to look at the `URI.query` field to assemble the full object name and therefore broke globbing. I added a few tests specifically that used single-character match pattern (`?`) and got rid of `URI` in favor of a regex to get ahead of any other potential footguns.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13173

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13178:1314,Deployability,update,updates,1314,"This PR adds support for Azure SAS tokens in QoB. A SAS token is basically a blob storage URI with a short-lived credential to access that resource appended as a URL query string. In such a scenario where the FS receives a blob URI with a SAS token, that token should be used instead of the latent credentials on the system. Most of the changes to the `AzureStorageFS.scala` are to parse out a SAS token from blob names. This change brings with it a couple caveats. Unfortunately it is not possible to truly disambiguate a SAS token from a glob pattern, or even just a normal blob filename. So we take what is probably a safe assumption and look to see if there exists a query-parameter style key-value pair after the last `?` in the blob name. If this is the case, we treat everything after the last `?` as a SAS token. If this condition is not satsified, we say there is no SAS token and treat the whole path as the blob name. This logic already exists in python, but I'm open to alternatives. Introducing SAS tokens also breaks the way globbing is currently implemented, where it is deemed safe to iteratively append components to the end of a blob URI string. I added an abstract type member to `FS` and instead of a `String` have `globWithPrefix` accept that associated URL type that can properly handle path updates.
