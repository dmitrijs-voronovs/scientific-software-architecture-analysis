Note this error is not seen when I tested on the RooMomentMorph class, only in the ND case. . ### To Reproduce; I have prepared a small example in order to reproduce the error: ; ```c++; #include <iostream>; #include <fstream>; #include<TRandom.h>. float input_lambda(float width){; return -6.347e-07*width*width+0.0015*width+1.835;; }. void exampleND(){; auto myy = new RooRealVar(""myy"", ""myy"", 110., 155.);; myy->setBins(450.);. auto w = new RooWorkspace(""w"");. auto hist_1 = new TH1F(""hist_1_125"",""hist_1_125"", 450, 110., 155.);; for(double i=0; i<10000; i++){hist_1->Fill(gRandom->Gaus(125., input_lambda(1.)));}; auto hist_400 = new TH1F(""hist_400_125"",""hist_400_125"", 450, 110., 155.);; for(double i=0; i<10000; i++){hist_400->Fill(gRandom->Gaus(125., input_lambda(400.)));}; hist_1->Scale(1./hist_1->Integral());; hist_400->Scale(1./hist_400->Integral());. auto data_sig_1 = new RooDataHist(""data_sig_1"", ""data_sig_1"", RooArgList(*myy), hist_1);; auto data_sig_400 = new RooDataHist(""data_sig_400"", ""data_sig_400"", RooArgList(*myy), hist_400);. auto hist_pdf_1 = new RooHistPdf(""hist_pdf_1"", ""hist_pdf_1"", RooArgList(*myy), *data_sig_1);; auto hist_pdf_400 = new RooHistPdf(""hist_pdf_400"", ""hist_pdf_400"", RooArgList(*myy), *data_sig_400);. std::vector<float> Lambda_list = {1., 400.};; auto Lambda = RooRealVar(""lambda"", ""lambda"", 1., 400.);; auto paramVec = TVectorD(2);; for (int j = 0; j < 2; ++j){; 	paramVec[j] = Lambda_list[j];; }. auto morph_ND = new RooMomentMorphND(""morph_ND"",""morph_ND"", Lambda, RooArgList(*myy), RooArgList(*hist_pdf_1, *hist_pdf_400), paramVec, RooMomentMorphND::Linear);. w->import(*morph_ND);; w->Print();; w->writeToFile(""test_workspace.root"");; }; ```; If you run the code, you will see t",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11876

If not feasible, the build error should at least guide the user / package aintainer the configuration option to solve the issue or where to find the solution. ### To Reproduce. 1. Build against the master branch (6.27, 0fafc31efb5a94472af2a6b35ded27796cb141c8) with CMake Flag `-Dbuiltin_llvm=OFF`.; (See the external context for steps to reproduce the behavior with the Nix package manager and Nixpkgs.); 2. See error. ### Setup; <!--; 1. ROOT version; 3. Operating system; 4. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself.; -->; 1.

The behavior of `-=` and `+=` on a `KahanSum` were not symmetric, leading to slight bit-wise inaccuracies. In fits, where such operations are done a lot of times (e.g. through the offsetting mechanism in RooFit which subtracts a constant `KahanSum` term after each likelihood evaluation), this can add up to significant numerical divergence. This in turn makes it hard to test the accuracy of new numerical implementations. In particular, we are trying to fix a bug in `MultiProcess::LikelihoodJob`, which builds on this `KahanSum` fix. This commit adds test cases around the precision limits, making sure that all behavior is now symmetric and internally consistent. To aid in the test cases and also make the `KahanSum` objects more versatile, the commit also adds some extra `-` and `+` operators. Using these, we verify some additional desirable symmetry properties: that x - x = 0, and y + (-x) = y - x.

To achieve $O(n_x n_y n_z)$ time complexity (instead of $O(n_x^2 n_y^2 n_z^2)$ ), the method is implemented using the [inclusion-exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle) while referencing the content of the previously-computed neighboring bins. Namely,. $$\begin{cases}; S_{i_x i_y i_z} = a_{i_x i_y i_z} + S_{(i_x-1) i_y i_z} + S_{i_x (i_y-1) i_z} + S_{i_x i_y (i_z-1)} - S_{(i_x-1) (i_y-1) i_z} - S_{i_x (i_y-1) (i_z-1)} - S_{(i_x-1) i_y (i_z-1)} + S_{(i_x-1) (i_y-1) (i_z-1)} & (\text{forward}) \\; S_{i_x i_y i_z} = a_{i_x i_y i_z} + S_{(i_x+1) i_y i_z} + S_{i_x (i_y+1) i_z} + S_{i_x i_y (i_z+1)} - S_{(i_x+1) (i_y+1) i_z} - S_{i_x (i_y+1) (i_z+1)} - S_{(i_x+1) i_y (i_z+1)} + S_{(i_x+1) (i_y+1) (i_z+1)} & (\text{backward}); \end{cases}$$. This is useful when computing the selection efficiency of two variables:; For example, one can get a histogram (`*h2_eff_pt_eta`) in which each bin represents the selection efficiency where pt and eta is greater than the lower edges of the bin from the 2D histogram of these variables (`*h2_pt_eta`) with the following code,. ```c++; TH2 *h2_eff_pt_eta = h2_pt_eta->GetCumulative(kFALSE, ""_efficiency"");; h2_eff_pt_eta->Scale(h2_eff_pt_eta->GetBinContent(1, 1));; ```. ## Checklist:. - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12023:478,Testability,test,test,478,"### Describe the bug; On exit of program, program can crash from SIGSEGV triggered by `std::_Sp_counted_base` called during processing destructor of `ROOT::RDF::RInterface<ROOT::Detail::RDF::RNodeBase, void>::~RInterface`. ### Expected behavior; Since `ROOT::RDF::RNode` is based on smart pointers, and user is not trying to hack pointers itself, crash should not happen. ### To Reproduce; This problem arose from a larger framework, I made a minimal reproduce:; 1. Decompress [test.tar.gz](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/10410351/test.tar.gz) in anywhere you want, `cd <...>`; 2. `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .`; 3. Run `./makesample` to generate sample to be used.; 4. Run `./main ../example/toy.json` : Crash; 5. Run `./main ../example/toy1.json` : Won't crash. ### Setup; I have 2 setups, one can reproduce the problem and another won't. #### The one can reproduce; Fedora 37, with GCC `12.2.1 20221121 (Red Hat 12.2.1-4) (GCC)`; ```; ------------------------------------------------------------------; | Welcome to ROOT 6.26/10 https://root.cern |; | (c) 1995-2021, The ROOT Team; conception: R.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12023:543,Testability,test,test,543,"### Describe the bug; On exit of program, program can crash from SIGSEGV triggered by `std::_Sp_counted_base` called during processing destructor of `ROOT::RDF::RInterface<ROOT::Detail::RDF::RNodeBase, void>::~RInterface`. ### Expected behavior; Since `ROOT::RDF::RNode` is based on smart pointers, and user is not trying to hack pointers itself, crash should not happen. ### To Reproduce; This problem arose from a larger framework, I made a minimal reproduce:; 1. Decompress [test.tar.gz](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/10410351/test.tar.gz) in anywhere you want, `cd <...>`; 2. `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .`; 3. Run `./makesample` to generate sample to be used.; 4. Run `./main ../example/toy.json` : Crash; 5. Run `./main ../example/toy1.json` : Won't crash. ### Setup; I have 2 setups, one can reproduce the problem and another won't. #### The one can reproduce; Fedora 37, with GCC `12.2.1 20221121 (Red Hat 12.2.1-4) (GCC)`; ```; ------------------------------------------------------------------; | Welcome to ROOT 6.26/10 https://root.cern |; | (c) 1995-2021, The ROOT Team; conception: R.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12136:382,Energy Efficiency,allocate,allocated,382,"### Describe the bug; `RNTupleView` advertises a defaulted move constructor, but unconditionally frees state in it's destructor causing a double free in the destructor of the second instance. This is caused by the call to `fField.DestroyValue(fValue);` in the dtor. `fValue` is copyable and moveable since the copy special member functions are not deleted, but contains pointers to allocated memory which are not duplicated during copies or transferred during a move (with leaving the moved from pointer `nullptr`) and thus shared between two instances of `RNTupleView`. Although the documentation of `RFieldValue`, the type of `fValue`, claims that the class owns no memory, the class receives a heap allocated value during the call chain of the constructor initialization list of `RNTupleView`: `fValue(fField.GenerateValue())`. Since the ownership model is convoluted to me, I cannot propose an easy fix. From the perspective of `RNTupleView`, `RFieldValue` would need a user-defined move ctor transferrign ownership of the heap-allocated pointer and `RNTupleView`'s dtor needs to be able to detect and handle a moved-from state. But the former is against the documented intent of the class, so I need to leave this to the designers of those classes :). ### Expected behavior; The move ctor of `RNTupleView` should let the dtors of both `RNTupleView` instances finish correctly. ### To Reproduce. Example:; ```c++; auto ntuple = RE::RNTupleReader::Open(RE::RNTupleModel::Create(), ""DecayTree"", ""B2HHH~none.ntuple"");; {; auto viewH1IsMuon = ntuple->GetView<int>(""H1_isMuon"");; {; auto copy{std::move(viewH1IsMuon)};; } // dtor for copy, frees shared state; } // dtor for viewH1IsMuon, double free; ```.

Since `rootcling_impl` also defines this symbol as global, there is an unresolved conflict. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->. Tbh I'm not sure how this should be fixed. Clearly by default there is no `strlcat` et al on linux by default, *but* there is libbsd and this should be checked somwhere. Currently this check is in [core/foundation/inc/ROOT/RConfig.hxx:248-276](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/fd244e56523bf5c5957bfae5117b36ca73c27813/core/foundation/inc/ROOT/RConfig.hxx#L248-L276) and only takes into account the operating system. Check with [`__has_include`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/include) if `bsd/string.h` exists on other unixes *might* be a way to do it, but I would have no clue how to do the proper linking. Also it doesn't fix the issue if libbsd is introduced in a downstream project using ROOT. Alternatively, I think the ""better"" solution is to add a `link_libbsd` build option (disabled by default ofc). If enabled, it adds `-lbsd` to the public link flags of `Clib` and sets some compile flag like `HAS_STRLCPY_VIA_LIBBSD` (in addition to `HAS_STRLCPY`) that triggers the inclusion of bsd/string.h in clib/inc/strlcpy.h in the `#else` case of `#ifndef HAS_STRLCPY`. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1.

This is surprising for users (hence the big warning in the docs linked above) and makes it unnecessarily difficult to e.g. attach a numpy array as an additional column (because it's hard to index into it correctly without stable global row numbers). We could instead make `rdfentry_` always match the ""real"" (global) entry number in the dataset -- if only each MT task knew the offset of the current tree w.r.t. all other trees in the chain. ### Proposed solution . - have TTreeProcessorMT tell each MT task which tree it is processing w.r.t. to the global chain (`#1`, `#2`, `#3`, ...); - have each task calculate its tree's offset by going over a list of tree entry numbers, filling missing values as needed (the list of entry numbers would be implemented as an array of fixed size `nTrees` with atomic elements. This plus the fact that threads only need to write into the atomic elements if they see the value has not been calculated yet should minimize thread contention) . ### Other solution considered. - we could always build a global TChain, for every task, and always use global entry numbers everywhere. However this would require that TTreeProcessorMT reads out the number of entries in each tree before the tasks even start, because it first needs to come up with entry ranges for each task. My intuition is that this would bring a larger performance impact than the proposed solution: we know from DistRDF that the (redundant) opening O(1k) remote files at startup is a significant cost.; - we could do nothing: `rdfentry_` would be unstable and it could not be relied upon to e.g. index into manually added ""friend columns"" or to fill TEntryLists (like [this user would have liked to do](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/accessing-entry-information-using-rdataframe/52378))",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12190

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12202:59,Availability,failure,failure,59,"# This Pull request:. ## Changes or fixes:. Triggered by a failure to run an ATLAS Higgs combination fit using the MultiProcess-parallelized LikelihoodJob, this PR changes the way offsetting is handled in the TestStatistics::LikelihoodWrapper family of classes. This in turn improves precision of evaluations, making many parallelized likelihood evaluations now bit-wise exactly equal to non-parallel evaluations. This allows us to better debug the Higgs fit. After this PR, the public Higgs workspace used in rootbench can be fit with LikelihoodJob enabled. In detail, this PR changes the following:. - Increased precision:; * Per-component offsets: instead of one offset for the total LikelihoodWrapper, we switched to a vector of offsets: one for each likelihood component. This makes a difference only for RooSumL fits, i.e. simultaneous PDF fits or fits with constraint or global observable terms. This brings the results of these fits closer to the old-style RooNLLVar fits, because those also use per-component offsets (per-RooNLLVar in a RooAddition to be exact).; * In LikelihoodJob::evaluate, the result_ KahanSum is no longer initialized to zero, but is initialized to the first value in the results_ array, both sum and carry term. This sometimes makes a difference: adding a term with a small but non-zero carry term to an existing sum with a zero sum and zero carry term can make the small non-zero carry term disappear.; * Due to these changes and the earlier KahanSum updates, we were able to tighten the tolerance of tests in testLikelihoodSerial, testLikelihoodJob and testLikelihoodGradientJob, with many tests now passing EXPECT_EQ.; * testLikelihoodGradientJob adds offsetting to the parameterized test matrices of the LikelihoodGradientJobTest cases to test all the above (and below) changes. - Offset synchronization:; * LikelihoodWrapper and LikelihoodGradientWrapper now store a shared_ptr to the offsets instead of raw offsets.

Triggered by a failure to run an ATLAS Higgs combination fit using the MultiProcess-parallelized LikelihoodJob, this PR changes the way offsetting is handled in the TestStatistics::LikelihoodWrapper family of classes. This in turn improves precision of evaluations, making many parallelized likelihood evaluations now bit-wise exactly equal to non-parallel evaluations. This allows us to better debug the Higgs fit. After this PR, the public Higgs workspace used in rootbench can be fit with LikelihoodJob enabled. In detail, this PR changes the following:. - Increased precision:; * Per-component offsets: instead of one offset for the total LikelihoodWrapper, we switched to a vector of offsets: one for each likelihood component. This makes a difference only for RooSumL fits, i.e. simultaneous PDF fits or fits with constraint or global observable terms. This brings the results of these fits closer to the old-style RooNLLVar fits, because those also use per-component offsets (per-RooNLLVar in a RooAddition to be exact).; * In LikelihoodJob::evaluate, the result_ KahanSum is no longer initialized to zero, but is initialized to the first value in the results_ array, both sum and carry term. This sometimes makes a difference: adding a term with a small but non-zero carry term to an existing sum with a zero sum and zero carry term can make the small non-zero carry term disappear.; * Due to these changes and the earlier KahanSum updates, we were able to tighten the tolerance of tests in testLikelihoodSerial, testLikelihoodJob and testLikelihoodGradientJob, with many tests now passing EXPECT_EQ.; * testLikelihoodGradientJob adds offsetting to the parameterized test matrices of the LikelihoodGradientJobTest cases to test all the above (and below) changes. - Offset synchronization:; * LikelihoodWrapper and LikelihoodGradientWrapper now store a shared_ptr to the offsets instead of raw offsets.

At construction time within a MinuitFcnGrad, they get passed the same single offset object so that it is always kept synced between the different likelihood calculators. If it isn't synced and the likelihood gets different offsets at different times, the minimizer understandably gets very confused. This was the case before this commit, which was, in fact, a bug.; * For LikelihoodJob and LikelihoodGradientJob, the offsets are also synchronized to all workers via update_state. For this, we simply check before evaluation whether offsets have changed since the previous evaluation and if so they are sent over the MultiProcess::Messenger.

Changing RVecF to RVec\<float\> fixes the issue. Numba functions also don't seem to allow defining RVecs inside them, giving ; ```; TypingError: Failed in nopython mode pipeline (step: nopython frontend); Unknown attribute 'RVec' of type Module(<module 'ROOT' from '/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_102b_swan/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/lib/ROOT/__init__.py'>).

Modifying the code where pypowarray is defined to match the code above reproduces the issue with defintions. ### Setup; 1. ROOT Version: 6.26/08; 2. Operating system: CentOS 7; 3.

A temporary fix was introduced for now in FairRoot, which is to simply do the recompute for all TGeoVolumeAssembly in the geometry tree, which seems to be fast enough that we do not have to try to track affected Volumes to be more selective. ; This may however not be the case later when applied to complete geometries for experiments like CBM. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior with the attached files (includes ""ROOT-only"" examples both for problem and for macro-level fix):; 1. Compile a copy of ROOT 6.22.08 (done with FairSoft apr21p2 and FairRoot v18.6.7, should work with any older versions of each and with recent versions of FairRoot, as well as with a standalone version of ROOT); 1.

Supplying invalid values (np.nan) to TGraph does not warn me of invalid data, and the TGraph collapses into a single line. The same thing happens for TGraphErrors as well. For a user such as myself, it takes time to figure out what is going on. I've had many problems with ROOT not drawing something, so it took quite a lot of debugging to figure out the problem was the data this time. It would improve user experience and save time for end users. ### Expected behavior. Warning or exception should be raised. Optionally, an empty graph can be drawn. . ### To Reproduce; Reproducible code with a bug (with np.nan values):; ```; import ROOT; canvas = ROOT.TCanvas(f""test_canvas"", ""title"", 400, 400); canvas.Draw(); canvas.cd(). num_values = 5; g = ROOT.TGraph(num_values, ; np.arange(num_values, dtype='float'), ; np.full(num_values, fill_value=np.nan)); g.SetMarkerSize(2); g.SetMarkerStyle(2); g.DrawClone('AP'); ```; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22337362/218409911-59aa5edb-e2d2-4410-b3e9-0159b3750721.png).

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12372:101,Availability,failure,failures,101,"### Describe the bug. When building root 6.28.00 for RHEL+EPEL 8 on ppc64le there are build and test failures. Test failures happens in compiled unit tests (gtest), tests using interpreded root and tests using python. All tests fail with the error ""pure virtual method called"" and the backtrace all indicate the same line:. ~~~; #9 llvm::orc::ExecutionSession::lookup (this=0x1099d16e0, SearchOrder=std::vector of length 1, capacity 1 = {...}, Name=..., RequiredState=<optimized out>) at /builddir/build/BUILD/root-6.28.00/interpreter/llvm/src/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Core.cpp:2040; ~~~. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/db1e83871f8a34574c4980d94c5e5ab667fa8672/interpreter/llvm/src/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Core.cpp#L2031-L2043. 187 tests fail with the error ""pure virtual method called"". Most of them are related to dataframe or roofit, but not exclusively. These errors do not happen on the other RHEL+EPEL 8 architecture (x86_64).; These errors do not happen on ppc64le on other systems: RHEL+EPEL 9, Fedora 36, 37, 38, 39.

Test failures happens in compiled unit tests (gtest), tests using interpreded root and tests using python. All tests fail with the error ""pure virtual method called"" and the backtrace all indicate the same line:. ~~~; #9 llvm::orc::ExecutionSession::lookup (this=0x1099d16e0, SearchOrder=std::vector of length 1, capacity 1 = {...}, Name=..., RequiredState=<optimized out>) at /builddir/build/BUILD/root-6.28.00/interpreter/llvm/src/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Core.cpp:2040; ~~~. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/db1e83871f8a34574c4980d94c5e5ab667fa8672/interpreter/llvm/src/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Core.cpp#L2031-L2043. 187 tests fail with the error ""pure virtual method called"". Most of them are related to dataframe or roofit, but not exclusively. These errors do not happen on the other RHEL+EPEL 8 architecture (x86_64).; These errors do not happen on ppc64le on other systems: RHEL+EPEL 9, Fedora 36, 37, 38, 39.
