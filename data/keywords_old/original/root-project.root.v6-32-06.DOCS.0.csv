ROOT is a unified software package for the storage, processing, and analysis of ; scientific data: from its acquisition to the final visualization in form of highly ; customizable, publication-ready plots. It is reliable, performant and well supported,; easy to use and obtain, and strives to maximize the quantity and impact of scientific ; results obtained per unit cost, both of human effort and computing resources. ROOT provides a very efficient storage system for data models, ; that demonstrated to scale at the Large Hadron Collider experiments: Exabytes ; of scientific data are written in columnar ROOT format.; ROOT comes with histogramming capabilities in an arbitrary number of ; dimensions, curve fitting, statistical modelling, minimization, to allow; the easy setup of a data analysis system that can query and process the data; interactively or in batch mode, as well as a general parallel processing; framework, RDataFrame, that can considerably speed up an analysis, taking ; full advantage of multi-core and distributed systems. ROOT is performance critical software written in C++ and enables rapid prototyping ; powered by a unique C++ compliant interpreter called Cling. ; Cling also enables performant C++ type introspection which is a building block of automatic ; interoperability with Python. Thanks to PyROOT, leveraging the cppyy technology, ; ROOT offers efficient, on-demand C++/Python interoperability in a uniform cross-language ; execution environment. ROOT fully embraces open-source, it's made with passion by its community,; for the benefit of its community.

Simplifies I/O logic,; reduce duplication of code in many places, fix errors.; Main advantage - one could try to keep code synchronous with C++.; 2. Avoid objects cloning when object referenced several times.; 3. Treat special cases (collection, arrays) in one place.; This is major advantage, while any new classes need to be implemented only once.; 4. Object representation, produced by JSRootIO is similar to; objects, produced by TBufferJSON class. By this one can exchange; I/O engine and use same JavaSctript graphic for display.; 5. More clear functions to display different elements of the file.; In the future functions should be fully separated from I/O part; and organized in similar way as online part.; 6. Eliminate usage of gFile pointer in the I/O part.; 7. Provide TBufferJSON::JsonWriteMember method. It allows to stream any; selected data member of the class.

Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]]. It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers.

It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers. It can be loaded before starting the; next instance to avoid doing redundant work. At build time, rootcling (ROOT's; dictionary generator) creates such PCH file which is attached at ROOT startup; time. Its major drawback is the fact that if third-party users want to include; their libraries, they have to recompile it every time there is a change. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) in; ROOT files to avoid the potentially expensive call to the interpreter if the; information is not the PCH. For example, ROOT's libGeom and other third-party; code. This is done to circumvent the costly call to `ShowMembers` which will; require parsing. ROOTMAP files reduce parsing for code which is not in the PCH. Consider; `foo::bar` and `S` are defined in `libFoo`'s `Foo.h`:; ```cpp; // Foo.h; namespace foo { struct bar{}; }; struct S{};; ```. ```bash; # libFoo.rootmap; { decls }; namespace foo { }; struct S;; ; [ libFoo.so ]; # List of selected classes; class bar; struct S; ```. ```cpp; // G__Foo.cxx ",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

Moreover, the loading of the annotated forward; declarations can happen at any time during parsing. This is nick-named; ""recursive parsing"" and is a code path that exists only in ROOT, never exercised; by clang itself and is thus not well tested. The behavior of line #2 is; equivalent to:; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] foo::bar/*store parsing state*/; gSystem->Load(""Foo"");; // More scaffolding.; extern int __Cling_AutoLoading_Map;; namespace foo{struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) bar;}; struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) S;; // More initialization scaffolding.; /*restore parsing state*/ *baz1;; ```.

The interaction between some of the features often; break design and introduce layering violations. ## From C++ Modules to Dictionaries. C++ Modules have native capabilities to avoid reparsing. It combines all; home-grown solutions to avoid the costly operation at industry quality. Currently, when ROOT is built with `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` it gives priority to; C++ Module files (real *pcm* files). If such a file is present it reads all; necessary information from it. If no such file is present ROOT falls back to the; standard information flow. ### Observable differences from 'standard' ROOT. As always, ROOT is (mostly) API and ABI compatible. C++ Modules-aware ROOT is no; different. There are several differences which can be noticed:; * \*modulemap files in $ROOTSYS/include -- those files are used by ",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:17637,Availability,avail,available,17637," we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI. The; example becomes equivalent to:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import Foo.*; // Preload Foo if it is not in the GMI.; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```. Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH.

Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:3029,Deployability,install,installations,3029,"ry footprint and execution time;; * Incremental adoption -- provide third-party code with an incremental; migration process for their codebases. ## Motivation. An implementation of the modules concepts exists in the LLVM frontend Clang used; as a library by ROOT [[2]]. Clang supports the Modules TS and hosts modules ; research and development work. The implementation encourages incremental, ; bottom-up [[3]] adoption of the modules feature. Modules in Clang are designed; to work for C, C++, ObjectiveC, ObjectiveC++ and Swift. Users can enable the; modules feature without modifications in header files. The LLVM compiler allows; users to specify module interfaces in dedicated file, called *module maps files*.; A module map file expresses the mapping between a module file and a collection; of header files. If the compiler finds such file in the include paths it; automatically generates, imports and uses module files. The module map files can; be mounted using the compiler's virtual file system overlay mechanism to; non-writable production library installations. In practice, a non-invasive *modularization* can be done easily by introducing; a module map file. ```cpp; // A.h ; int pow2(int x) {; return x * x;; }; ```; ```cpp; // B.cpp; #include ""A.h"" // clang rewires this to import A.; int main() {; return pow2(42);; }; ```. ```cpp; // A.h module interface, aka module map file; module A {; header ""A.h""; export * // clang exports the contents of A.h as part of module A.; }; ```. A.h defines *pow2*, the module map file instructs clang to create *A.pcm* and; import it in B.cpp. In a number of cases the module map files can be automatically generated if the; build system knows about the list of header files in every package. . ### Header parsing in ROOT. ```cpp; // A.h; #include <string>; #include <vector>; template <class T, class U = int> struct AStruct {; void doIt() { /*...*/ }; std::string Name; ; std::vector<U> Collection;; // ...; };. template<class T, class U = AStruc",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

The code snippet bellow demonstrates the efforts which ROOT does to; avoid parsing redundant code. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; ```. When starting up ROOT, it will locate all files with extensions \*.rootmap. It; parses the code in section {decls} and creates an internal map for the entities; defined in \[libFoo.so\] section. Upon seeing an unknown identifier, the; implementation searches in the database if this is a known entity. Line #1 does not require a definition and the forward declaration consumed at; startup is sufficient. Parsing of `Foo.h` is not required. This comes at a cost; of having some non-trivial patches in clang to merge default function arguments; and default template arguments. The design of the ROOTMAP infrastructure; requires the default arguments to be attached to more than one declaration which; is not allowed by standard C++. The behavior of line #1 is equivalent to:; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] S *s;; ```. Line #2 does not require a definition, however, the second identifier lookup; fails. The implementation knows that `foo::bar` is in *libFoo*. It `dlopen`s; libFoo which in turn, during its static initialization, inserts annotated forward; declaration as shown in `G__Foo.cxx`. In turn, this resolves `foo::bar` and; parsing of `Foo.h` is again avoided at relatively small overhead. However, this; is very hard to measure because the dictionary of each library can have different; amount of content. In the case where the library is big and the annotated; forward declarations are many, and we want to include a relatively small header; file it may not ",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

For example, all related; headers of *libGeom* are persisted in *Geom.pcm*. There are a few notable; examples, which are specific to the way we build ROOT. In certain cases we; want some header files to be compiled within C context or with RTTI on/off.; That's mostly for bootstrapping ROOT (aka rootcling stage1).; * modulemap.overlay.yaml -- automatically created virtual filesystem overlay; file. This file introduces C++ Modules for external dependencies.; For example, to 'modularize' glibc for ROOT we would need to place a modulemap; file in (usually) `/usr/include`. This folder is not writable on many; platforms. The vfs file tells the compiler to pretend there is a file at a; specific location. This way we 'mount' `/usr/include/module.modulemap`; non-invasively. The reasons why we need to extend the C++ modules support; beyond ROOT is described bellow.; * rootcling -cxxmodule creates a single artifact *Name.pcm* after the library; name. At a final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct. In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries.

These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms. We support all platforms with glibc++ versions: 5.2 onward. We support OSX from XCode 10 onward. ## Changes required by the users; * Self-contained header files -- every header file should be able to compile; on its own.

Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

This way we 'mount' `/usr/include/module.modulemap`; non-invasively. The reasons why we need to extend the C++ modules support; beyond ROOT is described bellow.; * rootcling -cxxmodule creates a single artifact *Name.pcm* after the library; name. At a final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct. In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches. The C++ modules system supports /*preloading*/ of all modules at startup time.; The current implementation of loading of C++ modules in clang has an overhead; and is between 40-60 MB depending on the ROOT configuration while there might; be 2x slowdown depending on the workflow. These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms. We support all platforms with glibc++ versions: 5.2 onw",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:17444,Energy Efficiency,efficient,efficient,17444,"s on a well-defined (by; the C++ standard) behavior. Currently, this comes with a constant performance; overhead which we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI. The; example becomes equivalent to:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import Foo.*; // Preload Foo if it is not in the GMI.; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```. Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules.

For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*. ## How to use; C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX).

If such a file is present it reads all; necessary information from it. If no such file is present ROOT falls back to the; standard information flow. ### Observable differences from 'standard' ROOT.

Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

A.h,; potentially only part of the descriptor of libA, expands to more than 26000; lines of code. ```cpp; // Main.cpp; #include ""A.h""; int main() {; do();; return 0;; }. ```; Main.cpp, reuses code from libA by including libA's descriptor and links against; libA. The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the;",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:5813,Modifiability,layers,layers,5813,"[] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]]. It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers. It can be loaded before starting the; next instance to avoid doing redundant work. At build time, rootcling (ROOT's; dictionary generator) creates such PCH file which is attached at ROOT startup; time. Its major drawback is the fact that if third-party users want to include; their libraries, they have to recompile it every time there is a change. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) in; ROOT files to avoid the potentially expensive call to the interpreter if the; information is not the PCH. For example, ROOT's libGeom and other third-party; code. This is done to circumvent the costly call to `ShowMembers` which will; requ",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

Line #3 requires a definition and the implementation behaves exactly as in #2.; Then it is informed that a definition is required, it reads the information in; the annotation and parses `Foo.h`. The recursive parsing happens at two places; making this code path error prone.; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] foo::bar/*store parsing state*/; gSystem->Load(""Foo"");; // More scaffolding.; extern int __Cling_AutoLoading_Map;; namespace foo{struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) bar;}; struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) S;; // More initialization scaffolding.; /*restore parsing state*/ baz1 /*store parsing state*/; #include <Foo.h>/*restore parsing state*/;; ```. To recap, unfortunately, ROOT PCH is not extendable; ROOTMAP requires a lot of; maintenance and goes on a very untested codepath, while RDICT has a very limited; scope. The three features require a lot of mechanisms to work together and the; corner cases are very many. The interaction between some of the features often; break design and introduce layering violations. ## From C++ Modules to Dictionaries. C++ Modules have native capabilities to avoid reparsing. It combines all; home-grown solutions to avoid the costly operation at industry quality. Currently, when ROOT is built with `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` it gives priority to; C++ Module files (real *pcm* files). If such a file is present it reads all; necessary information from it. If no such file is present ROOT falls back to the; standard information flow. ### Observable differences from 'standard' ROOT. As always, ROOT is (mostly) API and ABI compatible.

Currently, this comes with a constant performance; overhead which we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI. The; example becomes equivalent to:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import Foo.*; // Preload Foo if it is not in the GMI.; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```. Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available.

The implementation encourages incremental, ; bottom-up [[3]] adoption of the modules feature. Modules in Clang are designed; to work for C, C++, ObjectiveC, ObjectiveC++ and Swift. Users can enable the; modules feature without modifications in header files. The LLVM compiler allows; users to specify module interfaces in dedicated file, called *module maps files*.; A module map file expresses the mapping between a module file and a collection; of header files. If the compiler finds such file in the include paths it; automatically generates, imports and uses module files.

The design of the ROOTMAP infrastructure; requires the default arguments to be attached to more than one declaration which; is not allowed by standard C++. The behavior of line #1 is equivalent to:; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] S *s;; ```. Line #2 does not require a definition, however, the second identifier lookup; fails. The implementation knows that `foo::bar` is in *libFoo*. It `dlopen`s; libFoo which in turn, during its static initialization, inserts annotated forward; declaration as shown in `G__Foo.cxx`. In turn, this resolves `foo::bar` and; parsing of `Foo.h` is again avoided at relatively small overhead. However, this; is very hard to measure because the dictionary of each library can have different; amount of content. In the case where the library is big and the annotated; forward declarations are many, and we want to include a relatively small header; file it may not pay off. Moreover, the loading of the annotated forward; declarations can happen at any time during parsing.

Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]]. It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers. It can be loaded before starting the; next instance to avoid doing redundant work. At build time, rootcling (ROOT's; dictionary generator) creates such PCH file which is attached at ROOT startup; time. Its major drawback is the fact that if third-party users want to include; their libraries, they have to recompile it every time there is a change. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) in; ROOT files to avoid the potentially expensive call to the interpreter if the; information is not the PCH. For example, ROOT's libGeom and other third-party; code. This is done to circumvent the costly call to `ShowMembers` which will; require parsing. ROOTMAP files reduce parsing for code which is not in the PCH. Consider; `foo::bar` and `S` are defined in `libFoo`'s `Foo.h`:; ```cpp; // Foo.h; namespace foo { struct bar{}; }; struct S{};; ```. ```bash; # libFoo.rootmap; { decls }; namespace foo { }; struct S;; ; [ libFoo.so ]; # List of selected classes; class bar; struct S; ```. ```cpp; // G__Foo.cxx ",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

Preloading all modules at start up time turn our motivating example into:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition. ```. becomes equivalent to. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import ROOT.*;; root [] import Foo.*;; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```. The implementation avoids recursive actions and relies on a well-defined (by; the C++ standard) behavior. Currently, this comes with a constant performance; overhead which we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI. The; example becomes equivalent to:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import Foo.*; // Preload Foo if it is not in the GMI.; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```. Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison.

The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*. ## How to use; C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX).

The behavior of line #1 is equivalent to:; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] S *s;; ```. Line #2 does not require a definition, however, the second identifier lookup; fails. The implementation knows that `foo::bar` is in *libFoo*. It `dlopen`s; libFoo which in turn, during its static initialization, inserts annotated forward; declaration as shown in `G__Foo.cxx`. In turn, this resolves `foo::bar` and; parsing of `Foo.h` is again avoided at relatively small overhead. However, this; is very hard to measure because the dictionary of each library can have different; amount of content. In the case where the library is big and the annotated; forward declarations are many, and we want to include a relatively small header; file it may not pay off. Moreover, the loading of the annotated forward; declarations can happen at any time during parsing. This is nick-named; ""recursive parsing"" and is a code path that exists only in ROOT, never exercised; by clang itself and is thus not well tested. The behavior of line #2 is; equivalent to:; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] foo::bar/*store parsing state*/; gSystem->Load(""Foo"");; // More scaffolding.; extern int __Cling_AutoLoading_Map;; namespace foo{struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) bar;}; struct __attribute__((annotate(""$clingAutoload$Foo.h""))) S;; // More initialization scaffolding.; /*restore parsing state*/ *baz1;; ```. Line #3 requires a definition and the implementation behaves exactly as in #2.; Then it is informed that a definition is required, it reads the information in; the annotation and parses `Foo.h`. The recursive parsing happens at two places; making this code path error prone.; ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] namespace foo { };struct S;; root [] foo::bar/*store parsing state*/; gSystem->Load(""Foo"");; // More scaffolding.; extern int __Cling_AutoLoading_Map;; namespace foo{struct __",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it.

C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md

This class has a series of overcharged operators which ease the passing and obtaining of data; and code from R to C++ and vice versa. To create an object of this class the user must use the static methods `ROOT::R::TRInterface::Instance`; and `ROOT::R::TRInterface::InstancePtr` which return a reference object and a pointer object respectively. ~~~{.cxx}; #include<TRInterface.h>; ROOT::R::TRInterface &r=ROOT::R::TRInterface::Instance();; ~~~. #",MatchSource.DOCS,bindings/r/doc/users-guide/ROOTR_Users_Guide.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/r/doc/users-guide/ROOTR_Users_Guide.md

It allows to translate some datatypes from `C++` to R; inside the R environment and vice versa in an easy way to get the most from both R and ROOT.; To ease the sending and receiving of data in both environments, I overloaded the operators `<<`,`>>` and `[]`; which make look the job as a flow of data between environments, we will see more of that later.; With this tool you ca use any library or R package wich allows you to access a big amount of benefits to make statistical analysis.; ROOTR also has a R events processing system, which allows to use the R graphical system from `C++`. ## INSTALLATION; To install ROOTR please read first. - [https://root.cern.ch/building-root](https://root.cern.ch/building-root); - [https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites](https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites). ### COMPILING ROOTR ON MAC WITH CMAKE:; **NOTE:** Mac OSX Yosemite last xcode and without macports. **Prerequisites**. - xcode; - [xquartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/); - [R last version](https://www.r-project.org); - [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/).

An example of configuration file for **lighttpd** server is:. ```; server.modules += ( ""mod_fastcgi"" ); fastcgi.server = (; ""/root.app"" =>; (( ""host"" => ""192.168.1.11"",; ""port"" => 9000,; ""check-local"" => ""disable"",; ""docroot"" => ""/""; )); ); ```. Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`. Example of authorization configuration for FastCGI connection:. auth.require = ( ""/root.app"" => (; ""method"" => ""digest"",; ""realm"" => ""root"",; ""require"" => ""valid-user""; ) ). ## Integration with existing applications. In many practical cases no change of existing code is required. Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms are automatically scanned by the server and will be available to the users. If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with a [THttpServer::Register()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a73658daf379e87a4832fe9dc5c1483ed) call. Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the ",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md

Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell. ",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md

Here argument ""multi"" identifies, that server response should be parsed with `parseMulti()` function, which correctly interprets JSON code, produced by `multi.json` request. When sending such request to the server, one should provide list of objects names and not forget ""?number=N"" parameter in the request URL string. ## Using unix sockets. Starting from ROOT version 6.28, one can start server with unix socket. Just do:. Just call:; ```cpp; [root] new THttpServer(""socket:/tmp/root.socket""); ```; Name of socket should be unique and not match any existing files. Most easy way to access `THttpServer` running via unix socket is to configure ssh tunnel:; ```; [shell] ssh -L 7654:/tmp/root.socket localhost; ```. Once such tunnel is configured one can open following URL in web browser:; ```; [shell] xdg-open http://localhost:7654; ```. ## Websockets supports. Websockets support available starting from ROOT v6.12.; Minimal example provided in [$ROOTSYS/tutorials/http/ws.C](https://root.cern/doc/master/ws_8C.html) macro. To work with websockets, subclass of [THttpWSHandler](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpWSHandler.html) should be created and registered to THttpServer:. ```cpp; #include ""THttpWSHandler.h"". class TUserHandler : public THttpWSHandler {; public:; TUserHandler(const char *name, const char *title) : THttpWSHandler(name, title) {}. // provide custom HTML page when open correspondent address; TString GetDefaultPageContent() override { return ""file:ws.htm""; }. Bool_t ProcessWS(THttpCallArg *arg) override;; };; ```. Central method is `TUserHandler::ProcessWS(THttpCallArg *arg)`, where four kinds of websockets events should be handled:. * WS_CONNECT - clients attempts to create websockets, return false when refusing connection; * WS_READY - connection is ready to use, **wsid** can be obtained with `arg->GetWSId()` calls; * WS_DATA - new portion of data ",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md

[FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI) is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server like `Apache`, `lighttpd`, `Microsoft ISS` and many others. When starting THttpServer, one could specify:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2. Since Apache version 2.4 FastCGI is directly supported - there is no need to compile and install external modules any more.; One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```; ProxyPass ""/root.app/"" ""fcgi://localhost:9000/"" enablereuse=on; ```.

Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications.

If the access to the server is restricted with htdigest, it is recommended to use the **curl** program since only curl correctly implements such authentication method. The command will look like:. ```bash; [shell] curl --user ""accout:password"" http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/root.json --digest -o root.json; ```. ### Objects data access in JSON format. Request `root.json` implemented with [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. TBufferJSON generates such object representation, which could be directly used in [JSROOT](https://root.cern/js/) for drawing. `root.json` request returns either complete object or just object member like:. ```bash; [shell] wget http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/fTitle/root.json; ```. The result will be: `""title""`. For the `root.json` request one could specify the 'compact' parameter, which allow to reduce the number of spaces and new lines without data lost. This parameter can have values from '0' (no compression) till '3' (no spaces and new lines at all).; In addition, one can use simple compression algorithm for big arrays. If compact='10', zero values in the begin and at the end; of the array will be excluded. If compact='20', similar values or large zero gaps in-between will be compressed. Such array; compression support in JSROOT from version 4.8.2. Usage of `root.json` request is about as efficient as binary `root.bin` request.

For the ROOT classes which are implementing Draw method (like [TH1](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html) or [TGraph](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraph.html)) one could produce images with requests: `root.png`, `root.gif`, `root.jpeg`.

For all such requests following parameters could be specified:. - **h** - image height; - **w** - image width; - **opt** - draw options. ### Methods execution. By default THttpServer starts in monitoring (read-only) mode and therefore forbid any methods execution. One could specify read-write mode when server is started:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080;rw"");; ```. Or one could disable read-only mode with the call:. ```cpp; serv->SetReadOnly(kFALSE);; ```.

Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`. Example of authorization configuration for FastCGI connection:. auth.require = ( ""/root.app"" => (; ""method"" => ""digest"",; ""realm"" => ""root"",; ""require"" => ""valid-user""; ) ). ## Integration with existing applications. In many practical cases no change of existing code is required. Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms are automatically scanned by the server and will be available to the users. If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with a [THttpServer::Register()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a73658daf379e87a4832fe9dc5c1483ed) call. Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessR",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md

The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell. The big advantage of the http protocol is that it is not only supported in web browsers, but also in many other applications. One could use http requests to directly access ROOT objects and data members from any kind of scripts. If one starts a server and register an object like for example:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; TNamed* n1 = new TNamed(""obj"", ""title"");; serv->Register(""subfolder"", n1);; ```. One could request a JSON representation of such object with the command:. ```bash; [shell] wget http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/root.json; ```. Then, its representation will look like:. ```json; {; ""_typename"" : ""TNamed"",; ""fUniqueID"" : 0,; ""fBits"" : 0,; ""fName"" : ""obj"",; ""fTitle"" : ""title""; }; ```. The following requests can be performed:. | Name | Description |; | :----------- | :---------------- |; | `root.bin` | binary data produced by object streaming with `TBufferFile` |; | `root.json` | ROOT JSON representation for object and objects members |; | `file.root` | Creates TMemFile with the only object, from ROOT 6",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md

These kinds are coded as method name of THttpCallArg class and can be used like:. ```cpp; Bool_t TUserHandler::ProcessWS(THttpCallArg *arg); {; if (arg->IsMethod(""WS_CONNECT"")) {; return kTRUE; // accept all connections; }. if (arg->IsMethod(""WS_READY"")) {; SendCharStartWS(arg->GetWSId(), ""Init""); // immediately send message to the web socket; return kTRUE;; }. if (arg->IsMethod(""WS_CLOSE"")) {; return kTRUE; // just confirm connection; }. if (arg->IsMethod(""WS_DATA"")) {; TString str = arg->GetPostDataAsString();; printf(""Client msg: %s\n"", str.Data());; SendCharStarWS(arg->GetWSId(), ""Confirm"");; return kTRUE;; }. return kFALSE; // ignore all other kind of requests; }; ```.

[FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI) is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server like `Apache`, `lighttpd`, `Microsoft ISS` and many others. When starting THttpServer, one could specify:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2. Since Apache version 2.4 FastCGI is directly supported - there is no need to compile and install external modules any more.; One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```; ProxyPass ""/root.app/"" ""fcgi://localhost:9000/"" enablereuse=on; ```.

By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell.

In such case URL parameters are not required - specified item will be displayed automatically when web page is opened.; One also can configure to display several items at once. For that one also can configure layout of the drawing area:. ```cpp; serv->SetItemField(""/"", ""_layout"", ""grid2x2""); // layout for drawing area; serv->SetItemField(""/"", ""_drawitem"", ""[Files/job1.root/hpxpy,Files/job1.root/hpx]""); // items; serv->SetItemField(""/"", ""_drawopt"", ""[colz,hist]""); // options; ```.

If necessary, one also can automatically open ROOT file when web page is opened:. ```cpp; serv->SetItemField(""/"", ""_loadfile"", ""currentdir/hsimple.root""); // name of ROOT file to load; ```. ## Configuring user access. By default, the http server is open for anonymous access. One could restrict the access to the server for authenticated users only. First of all, one should create a password file, using the **htdigest** utility. ```bash; [shell] htdigest -c .htdigest domain_name user_name; ```. It is recommended not to use special symbols in domain or user names. Several users can be add to the "".htdigest"" file. When starting the server, the following arguments should be specified:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080?auth_file=.htdigest&auth_domain=domain_name"");; ```. After that, the web browser will automatically request to input a name/password for the domain ""domain_name"". Based on authorized accounts, one could restrict or enable access to some elements in the server objects hierarchy, using `THttpServer::Restrict()` method. For instance, one could hide complete folder from 'guest' account:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder"", ""hidden=gu",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md

Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell. The big advantage of the http protocol is that it is not only supported in web browsers, but also in many other applications. One could use http requests to directly access ROOT objects and data members from any kind of scripts. If one starts a server and register an object like for example:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; TNamed* n1 = new TNamed(""obj"", ""title"");; serv->Register(""subfolder"", n1);; ```.

When starting THttpServer, one could specify:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server.

While POST data in request used to transfer list of multiple requests, it is not possible to submit; such kind of requests, which themselves require data from POST block. To use `multi.json` request from the JavaScript, one should create special 'POST' HTTP request and properly parse it. JSROOT provides special method to do this:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, draw } from './jsrootsys/modules/core.mjs';; let res = await httpRequest(""your_server/multi.json?number=3"", ""multi"",; ""Files/job1.root/hpx/root.json\nFiles/job1.root/hpxpy/root.json\nFiles/job1.root/hprof/root.json\n"");; for (let n = 0; n < res.length; ++n) {; console.log('Requested element of type', res[n]._typename);; // draw('drawid', res[n], 'hist');; }; ```.

There are many benefits of such approach:. * standard http interface to ROOT application; * no any temporary ROOT files to access data; * user interface running in all browsers. ## Starting the HTTP server. To start the http server, at any time, create an instance of the [THttpServer](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html) class like:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; ```. This will start a [civetweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb)-based http server on the port 8080. Then one should be able to open the address `http://localhost:8080` in any modern browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE11) and browse objects created in application. By default, the server can access files, canvases, and histograms via the gROOT pointer. All those objects can be displayed with JSROOT graphics. There is a [server snapshot](https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/?layout=simple&item=Canvases/c1) of running macro [tutorials/http/httpserver.C](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/http/httpserver.C) from ROOT tutorials.

THttpServer provides partial access to the files from file system.; First of all, JSROOT scripts and files can be accessed via ""jsrootsys/"" path like ""http://localhost:8080/jsrootsys/modules/core.mjs"".; Files from ROOT install directory can be get via ""rootsys/"" path like ""http://localhost:8080/rootsys/icons/about.xpm"".; Also files from current directory where ROOT is running can be accessed via ""currentdir/"" path like ""http://localhost:8080/currentdir/file.txt"". If necessary, one can add custom path as well, using [THttpServer::AddLocation](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a5322c3bbfddb8eb6849297d83ccaf87f) method:. ```cpp; serv->AddLocation(""mydir/"", ""/home/user/specials"");; ```. Then files from that directory could be addressed via URL like ""http://localhost:8080/mydir/myfile.root"". ## Command interface. THttpServer class provide simple interface to invoke command from web browser.; One just register command like:. ```cpp; serv->RegisterCommand(""/DoSomething"", ""SomeFunction()"");; ```. Element with name `DoSomething` will appear in the web browser and can be clicked.; It will result in `gROOT->ProcessLineSync(""SomeFunction()"")` call. One could configure argument(s) for the command.; For that one should use `%arg1`, `%arg2` and so on identifiers. Like:. ```cpp; serv->RegisterCommand(""/DoSomething"", ""SomeFunction(%arg1%,%arg2%)"");; ```. User will be requested to enter arguments values, when command element clicked in the browser.; Example of the command which executes arbitrary string in application via ProcessLine looks like:. ```cpp; serv->RegisterCommand(""/Process"", ""%arg1%"");; ```.

Request `root.json` implemented with [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. TBufferJSON generates such object representation, which could be directly used in [JSROOT](https://root.cern/js/) for drawing. `root.json` request returns either complete object or just object member like:. ```bash; [shell] wget http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/fTitle/root.json; ```. The result will be: `""title""`. For the `root.json` request one could specify the 'compact' parameter, which allow to reduce the number of spaces and new lines without data lost. This parameter can have values from '0' (no compression) till '3' (no spaces and new lines at all).; In addition, one can use simple compression algorithm for big arrays. If compact='10', zero values in the begin and at the end; of the array will be excluded. If compact='20', similar values or large zero gaps in-between will be compressed. Such array; compression support in JSROOT from version 4.8.2. Usage of `root.json` request is about as efficient as binary `root.bin` request. Comparison of different request methods with TH2 histogram from hsimple.C shown in the table:. | Request | Size |; | :---------------------- | :--------- |; | root.bin | 7672 bytes |; | root.bin.gz | 1582 bytes |; | root.json | 8570 bytes |; | root.json?compact=3 | 6004 bytes |; | root.json?compact=23 | 5216 bytes |; | root.json.gz?compact=23 | 1855 bytes |.

https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:33251,Availability,failure,failures,33251,"itoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for the problem - one could load the file completely and exclude many partial I/O operations by this. To achieve this with JSROOT, one should add ""+"" sign at the end of the file name. Of course, it only could work for small files. If somebody still wants to use monitoring of data from ROOT files, could try link like:. - <https://root.cern/js/latest/?nobrowser&file=../files/hsimple.root+&item=hpx;1&monitoring=2000>. In this particular case, the histogram is not changing. ## JSROOT API. JSROOT can be used in arbitrary HTML pages to display data, produced with or without ROOT-based applications. Many different examples of JSROOT API usage can be found on [JSROOT API examples](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm) page. ### Import JSROOT functionality. Major JSROOT functions are located in `main.mjs` module and can be imported like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:37550,Availability,failure,failure,37550,"json);; JSROOT.draw('plain', obj, 'colz');; </script>; ```. ### Use of JSON. It is strongly recommended to use JSON when communicating with ROOT application.; THttpServer provides a JSON representation for every registered object with an url address like:. http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json. Such JSON representation generated using the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. One could create JSON file for any ROOT object directly, just writing in the code:. ```cpp; obj->SaveAs(""file.json"");; ```. To access data from a remote web server, it is recommended to use the `httpRequest` method.; For instance to receive object from a THttpServer server one could do:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest(""http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json"", ""object""); console.log('Read object of type', obj._typename);; ```. Function returns Promise, which provides parsed object (or Error in case of failure). If JSON string was obtained by different method, it could be parsed with `parse` function:. ```javascript; import { parse } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = parse(json_string);; ```. ### Objects drawing. After an object has been created, one can directly draw it. If HTML page has `<div>` element:. ```html; <div id=""drawing""></div>; ```. One could use the `draw` function:. ```javascript; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option. Here is complete [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_read_json) ans [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/read_json.htm):. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, draw, redraw, resize, cleanup } from ",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

In this particular case, the histogram is not changing. ## JSROOT API. JSROOT can be used in arbitrary HTML pages to display data, produced with or without ROOT-based applications. Many different examples of JSROOT API usage can be found on [JSROOT API examples](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm) page. ### Import JSROOT functionality. Major JSROOT functions are located in `main.mjs` module and can be imported like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"";; let file = await openFile(filename);; let obj = await file.readObject(""hpxpy;1"");; await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; </script>; ```. Here the default location `https://root.cern/js/latest/` is specified. One always can install JSROOT on private web server.; When JSROOT is used with THttpServer, the address looks like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { httpRequest, draw } from 'http://your_root_server:8080/jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest('http://your_root_server:8080/Objects/hist/root.json','object');; await draw('drawing', obj, 'hist');; </script>; ```. Loading main module is enough to get public JSROOT functionality - reading files and drawing objects.; One also can load some special components directly like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { HierarchyPainter } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/gui.mjs';. let h = new HierarchyPainter(""example"", ""myTreeDiv"");. // configure 'simple' in provided <div> element; // one also can specify ""grid2x2"" or ""flex"" or ""tabs""; h.setDisplay(""simple"", ""myMainDiv"");. // open file and display element; await h.openRootFile('../../files/hsimple.root');; await h.display('hpxpy;1"",""colz');; </script>; ```. After script l",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:39006,Deployability,update,update,39006,"s/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option. Here is complete [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_read_json) ans [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/read_json.htm):. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, draw, redraw, resize, cleanup } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/th2ul.json.gz"";; let obj = await httpRequest(filename, 'object');; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""lego"");; ```. In very seldom cases one need to access painter object, created in `draw()` function. This can be done via; handling Promise results like:. ```javascript; let painter = await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('Object type in painter', painter.getClassName());; ```. One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""drawing"", obj2, ""colz"");; ```. The `redraw` function will call `draw` if the drawing was not performed before. In the case when changing of HTML layout leads to resize of element with JSROOT drawing,; one should call `resize()` to let JSROOT adjust drawing size. One should do:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"");; ```. As second argument one could specify exact size for draw elements like:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"", { width: 500, height: 200 });; ```. To correctly cleanup JSROOT drawings from HTML element, one should call:. ```javascript; cleanup(""drawing"");; ```. ### File API. JSROOT defines the TFile class, which can be used to access binary ROOT files.; One should always remember that all I/O operations are asynchronous in JSROOT.; Therefore promises are used to retrieve results when the I/O operation is completed.; For example, reading an object from a file and displaying ",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

When transparent volumes appeared in the model, one could use `produceRenderOrder()` function; to correctly set rendering order. It should be used as:. ```javascript; import { produceRenderOrder } from './path_to_jsroot/modules/geom/TGeoPainter.mjs';; produceRenderOrder(scene, camera.position, 'box');; ```. Following methods can be applied: ""box"", ""pnt"", ""size"", ""ray"" and ""dflt"". See more info in draw options description for TGeo classes. Here is [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_geometry) and [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/tgeo_build.htm). ### Custom user class. There is [code example](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/tree/master/demo/custom) how custom user class can be implemented.; It shows usage of different draw options for the class and ability to access sub-elements of the object using specialized `expand` function. ### Use with Node.js. To install latest JSROOT release, just do:. ```bash; [shell] npm install jsroot; ```. To use in the Node.js scripts, one should add following line:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, makeSVG } from 'jsroot';; ```. Using JSROOT functionality, one can open binary ROOT files (local and remote), parse ROOT JSON,; create SVG output. For example, to create SVG image with lego plot, one should do:. ```javascript; import { openFile, makeSVG } from 'jsroot';; import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';. let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let obj = await file.readObject(""hpx;1"");; let svg = await makeSVG({ object: obj, option: ""lego2"", width: 1200, height: 800 });; writeFileSync(""lego2.svg"", svg);; ```. It is also possible to convert any JavaScript object into ROOT JSON string, using `toJSON()` function. Like:. ```javascript; import { toJSON, openFile, makeSVG } from 'jsroot';; import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';. let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; l",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

There is a problem of correct rendering of transparent volumes. To solve problem in general is very expensive (in terms of computing power), therefore several approximation solution can be applied:; * **dpnt**: distance from camera view to the volume center used as rendering order; * **dbox**: distance to nearest point from bonding box used as rendering order (**default**); * **dsize**: volume size is used as rendering order, can be used for centered volumes with many shells around; * **dray**: use raycasting to sort volumes in order they appear along rays, coming out of camera point; * **ddflt**: default three.js method for rendering transparent volumes; For different geometries different methods can be applied. In any case, all opaque volumes rendered first. ## Reading ROOT files from other servers. In principle, one could open any ROOT file placed in the web, providing the full URL to it like:. - <https://jsroot.gsi.de/latest/?file=https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root&item=hpx>.

In the main `<div>` element one can specify many custom parameters like one do it in URL string:. ```html; <div id=""simpleGUI"" path=""files/path"" files=""userfile1.root;subdir/usefile2.root"">; loading scripts ...; </div>; ```. ## Reading local ROOT files. JSROOT can read files from local file system using HTML5 FileReader functionality.; Main limitation here - user should interactively select files for reading.; There is button __""...""__ on the main JSROOT page, which starts file selection dialog.; If valid ROOT file is selected, JSROOT will be able to normally read content of such file. ## JSROOT with THttpServer. THttpServer provides http access to objects from running ROOT application.; JSROOT is used to implement the user interface in the web browsers. The layout of the main page coming from THttpServer is very similar to normal JSROOT page.; One could browse existing items and display them. A snapshot of running; server can be seen on the [demo page](https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/). One could also specify similar URL parameters to configure the displayed items and drawing options. It is also possible to display one single item from the THttpServer server like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/Files/job1.root/hpxpy/draw.htm?opt=colz>. ## Data monitoring with JSROOT. ### Monitoring with http server. The best possibility to organize the monitoring of data from a running application; is to use THttpServer. In such case the client can always access the latest; changes and request only the items currently displayed in the browser.; To enable monitoring, one should activate the appropriate checkbox or; provide __monitoring__ parameter in the URL string like:. <https://root.cern/js/lat",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

One could also specify similar URL parameters to configure the displayed items and drawing options.

The best possibility to organize the monitoring of data from a running application; is to use THttpServer. In such case the client can always access the latest; changes and request only the items currently displayed in the browser.; To enable monitoring, one should activate the appropriate checkbox or; provide __monitoring__ parameter in the URL string like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/Files/job1.root/hprof/draw.htm?monitoring=1000>. The parameter value is the update interval in milliseconds. ### JSON file-based monitoring. Solid file-based monitoring (without integration of THttpServer into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class,; which is capable to convert any (beside TTree) ROOT object into JSON. Any ROOT application can use such class to; create JSON files for selected objects and write such files in a directory,; which can be accessed via web server. Then one can use JSROOT to read such files and display objects in a web browser. There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>.

If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for the problem - one could load the file completely and exclude many partial I/O operations by this.

THttpServer provides http access to objects from running ROOT application.; JSROOT is used to implement the user interface in the web browsers. The layout of the main page coming from THttpServer is very similar to normal JSROOT page.; One could browse existing items and display them. A snapshot of running; server can be seen on the [demo page](https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/). One could also specify similar URL parameters to configure the displayed items and drawing options. It is also possible to display one single item from the THttpServer server like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/Files/job1.root/hpxpy/draw.htm?opt=colz>. ## Data monitoring with JSROOT. ### Monitoring with http server. The best possibility to organize the monitoring of data from a running application; is to use THttpServer. In such case the client can always access the latest; changes and request only the items currently displayed in the browser.; To enable monitoring, one should activate the appropriate checkbox or; provide __monitoring__ parameter in the URL string like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/Files/job1.root/hprof/draw.htm?monitoring=1000>. The parameter value is the update interval in milliseconds. ### JSON file-based monitoring. Solid file-based monitoring (without integration of THttpServer into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:32069,Modifiability,config,configuration,32069,"erver into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class,; which is capable to convert any (beside TTree) ROOT object into JSON. Any ROOT application can use such class to; create JSON files for selected objects and write such files in a directory,; which can be accessed via web server. Then one can use JSROOT to read such files and display objects in a web browser. There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>. Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; th",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

Here the default location `https://root.cern/js/latest/` is specified. One always can install JSROOT on private web server.; When JSROOT is used with THttpServer, the address looks like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { httpRequest, draw } from 'http://your_root_server:8080/jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest('http://your_root_server:8080/Objects/hist/root.json','object');; await draw('drawing', obj, 'hist');; </script>; ```. Loading main module is enough to get public JSROOT functionality - reading files and drawing objects.; One also can load some special components directly like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { HierarchyPainter } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/gui.mjs';. let h = new HierarchyPainter(""example"", ""myTreeDiv"");. // configure 'simple' in provided <div> element; // one also can specify ""grid2x2"" or ""flex"" or ""tabs""; h.setDisplay(""simple"", ""myMainDiv"");. // open file and display element; await h.openRootFile('../../files/hsimple.root');; await h.display('hpxpy;1"",""colz');; </script>; ```.

For instance,; one can configure custom format for different axes:. ```javascript; import { settings } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; settings.XValuesFormat = '4.2g';; settings.YValuesFormat = '6.1f';; ```. One also can use `build/jsroot.js` bundle to load all functionality at one and access it via `JSROOT` global handle:. ```javascript; <script src=""https://root.cern/js/latest/build/jsroot.js""></script>; <script>; // getting json string from somewhere; let obj = JSROOT.parse(root_json);; JSROOT.draw('plain', obj, 'colz');; </script>; ```. ### Use of JSON. It is strongly recommended to use JSON when communicating with ROOT application.; THttpServer provides a JSON representation for every registered object with an url address like:. http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json. Such JSON representation generated using the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. One could create JSON file for any ROOT object directly, just writing in the code:. ```cpp; obj->",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

Old `JSRootCore.js` was deprecated and removed in v6.2. All URL parameters for main script ignored now, to load JSROOT functionality one should use `JSROOT.require` function. To create standard GUI, `JSROOT.buildGUI` function has to be used. * Instead of `JSROOT.JSONR_unref()` one can use `JSROOT.parse()`. If object is provided to `JSROOT.parse()` it just replaces all references which were introduced by `TBufferJSON::ToJSON()` method. * Instead of `JSROOT.console()` one should use `console.log()`. Instead of `JSROOT.alert()` one should use `console.error()`. * Many settings were moved from `JSROOT.gStyle` to `JSROOT.settings` object. It was done to keep only TStyle-related members in `JSROOT.gStyle`. * Basic painter classes were renamed and made public:; - `JSROOT.TBasePainter` -> `JSROOT.BasePainter`; - `JSROOT.TObjectPainter` -> `JSROOT.ObjectPainter`. * Internal `ObjectPai",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

It can be easily done with [CORS Everywhere plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/) for the Firefox browser or [Allow CORS plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) for the Chrome browser. Next solution - install JSROOT on the server hosting ROOT files. In such configuration JSROOT does not issue CORS requests, therefore server and browsers can be used with their default settings. A simplified variant of such solution - copy only the top index.htm file from JSROOT package and specify the full path to `modules/gui.mjs` script like:. ```javascript; <script type=""module"">; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/gui.mjs';; // ...; </script>; ```. In the main `<div>` element one can specify many custom parameters like one do it in URL string:. ```html; <div id=""simpleGUI"" path=""files/path"" files=""userfile1.root;subdir/usefile2.root"">; loading scripts ...; </div>; ```. ## Reading local ROOT files. JSROOT can read files from local file system using HTML5 FileReader functionality.; Main limitation here - user should interactively select files for reading.; There is button __""...""__ on the main JSROOT page, which starts file selection dialog.; If valid ROOT file is selected, JSROOT will be able to normally read content of such file. ## JSROOT with THttpServer. THttpServer provides http access to objects from running ROOT application.; JSROOT is used to implement the user interface in the web browsers. The layout of the main page coming from THttpServer is very similar to normal JSROOT page.; One could browse existing items and display them. A snapshot of running; server can be seen on the [demo page](https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/). One could also specify similar URL parameters to configure the displayed items and drawing options. It is also possible to display one single item from the THttpServer server like:. <h",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for the problem - one could load the file completely and exclude many partial I/O operations by this. To achieve this with JSROOT, one should add ""+"" sign at the end of the file name. Of course, it only could work for small files.

Major JSROOT functions are located in `main.mjs` module and can be imported like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"";; let file = await ope",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

Here the default location `https://root.cern/js/latest/` is specified. One always can install JSROOT on private web server.; When JSROOT is used with THttpServer, the address looks like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { httpRequest, draw } from 'http://your_root_server:8080/jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest('http://your_root_server:8080/Objects/hist/root.json','object');; await draw('drawing', obj, 'hist');; </script>; ```. Loading main module is enough to get public JSROOT functionality - reading files and drawing objects.; One also can load some special components directly like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { HierarchyPainter } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/gui.mjs';. let h = new HierarchyPainter(""example"", ""myTreeDiv"");. // configure 'simple' in provided <div> element; // one also can specify ""grid2x2"" or ""flex"" or ""tabs""; h.setDisplay(""simple"", ""myMainDiv"");. // open file and display element; await h.openRootFile('../../files/hsimple.root');; await h.display('hpxpy;1"",""colz');; </script>; ```. After script loading one can configure different parameters in `gStyle` object.; It is instance of the `TStyle` object and behaves like `gStyle` variable in ROOT. For instance,; to change stat format using to display value in stats box:. ```javascript; import { gStyle } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; gStyle.fStatFormat = '7.5g';; ```.

Loading main module is enough to get public JSROOT functionality - reading files and drawing objects.; One also can load some special components directly like:. ```javascript; <script type='module'>; import { HierarchyPainter } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/gui.mjs';. let h = new HierarchyPainter(""example"", ""myTreeDiv"");. // configure 'simple' in provided <div> element; // one also can specify ""grid2x2"" or ""flex"" or ""tabs""; h.setDisplay(""simple"", ""myMainDiv"");. // open file and display element; await h.openRootFile('../../files/hsimple.root');; await h.display('hpxpy;1"",""colz');; </script>; ```. After script loading one can configure different parameters in `gStyle` object.; It is instance of the `TStyle` object and behaves like `gStyle` variable in ROOT. For instance,; to change stat format using to display value in stats box:. ```javascript; import { gStyle } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; gStyle.fStatFormat = '7.5g';; ```.

It is strongly recommended to use JSON when communicating with ROOT application.; THttpServer provides a JSON representation for every registered object with an url address like:. http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json. Such JSON representation generated using the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. One could create JSON file for any ROOT object directly, just writing in the code:. ```cpp; obj->SaveAs(""file.json"");; ```. To access data from a remote web server, it is recommended to use the `httpRequest` method.; For instance to receive object from a THttpServer server one could do:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:38163,Performance,perform,performed,38163,"use the `httpRequest` method.; For instance to receive object from a THttpServer server one could do:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest(""http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json"", ""object""); console.log('Read object of type', obj._typename);; ```. Function returns Promise, which provides parsed object (or Error in case of failure). If JSON string was obtained by different method, it could be parsed with `parse` function:. ```javascript; import { parse } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = parse(json_string);; ```. ### Objects drawing. After an object has been created, one can directly draw it. If HTML page has `<div>` element:. ```html; <div id=""drawing""></div>; ```. One could use the `draw` function:. ```javascript; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option. Here is complete [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_read_json) ans [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/read_json.htm):. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, draw, redraw, resize, cleanup } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/th2ul.json.gz"";; let obj = await httpRequest(filename, 'object');; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""lego"");; ```. In very seldom cases one need to access painter object, created in `draw()` function. This can be done via; handling Promise results like:. ```javascript; let painter = await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('Object type in painter', painter.getClassName());; ```. One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""dr",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

Here is complete [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_read_json) ans [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/read_json.htm):. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, draw, redraw, resize, cleanup } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/th2ul.json.gz"";; let obj = await httpRequest(filename, 'object');; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""lego"");; ```. In very seldom cases one need to access painter object, created in `draw()` function. This can be done via; handling Promise results like:. ```javascript; let painter = await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('Object type in painter', painter.getClassName());; ```. One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""drawing"", obj2, ""colz"");; ```. The `redraw` function will call `draw` if the drawing was not performed before. In the case when changing of HTML layout leads to resize of element with JSROOT drawing,; one should call `resize()` to let JSROOT adjust drawing size. One should do:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"");; ```. As second argument one could specify exact size for draw elements like:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"", { width: 500, height: 200 });; ```. To correctly cleanup JSROOT drawings from HTML element, one should call:. ```javascript; cleanup(""drawing"");; ```. ### File API. JSROOT defines the TFile class, which can be used to access binary ROOT files.; One should always remember that all I/O operations are asynchronous in JSROOT.; Therefore promises are used to retrieve results when the I/O operation is completed.; For example, reading an object from a file and displaying it will look like:. ```javascript; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"";; le",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

Simple TTree::Draw operation can be performed with following code:. ```javascript; import { openFile } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/io.mjs';; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/draw.mjs';; let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let tree = await file.readObject(""ntuple;1"");; draw(""drawing"", tree, ""px:py::pz>5"");; ```. To get access to selected branches, one should use `TSelector` class:. ```javascript; import { openFile } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/io.mjs';; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/draw.mjs';; import { TSelector, treeProcess } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/tree.mjs';. let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let tree = await file.readObject(""ntuple;1"");; let selector = new TSelector();. selector.AddBranch(""px"");; selector.AddBranch(""py"");. let cnt = 0, sumpx = 0, sumpy = 0;. selector.Begin = function() {; // function called before reading of TTree starts; }. sele",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

Such JSON string could be parsed by any other JSROOT-based application. When WebGL rendering is used (lego plots or TGeo drawing), on the Linux one need to have `DISPLAY` correctly set; to make it working. To run JSROOT on headless machine, one have to use `xvfb-run` utility,; see also [here](https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl#how-can-headless-gl-be-used-on-a-headless-linux-machine):. ```bash; [shell] xvfb-run -s ""-ac -screen 0 1280x1024x24"" node geomsvg.js; ```. ### Use with OpenUI5. [OpenUI5](http://openui5.org/) is a web toolkit for developers to ease and speed up the development of full-blown HTML5 web applications.; JSROOT provides `loadOpenui5` function to load supported OpenUI5:. ```javascript; <script type=""module"">; import { loadOpenui5 } from 'path_to_jsroot/modules/main.mjs';; let sap = await loadOpenui5();; sap.registerModulePath(""NavExample"", ""./"");; new sap.m.App ({; pages: [; new sap.m.Page({; title: ""Nav Container"",; enableScrolling : true,; content: [ new sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer({ name : ""NavExample"" })]; }); ]; }).placeAt(""content"");; </script>; ```. JSROOT uses <https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.128.0/> when no other source is specified. There are small details when using OpenUI5 with THttpServer. First of all, location of JSROOT modules should be specified; as `/jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs`. And then trying to access files from local disk, one should specify `/currentdir/` folder:. ```javascript; jQuery.sap.registerModulePath(""NavExample"", ""/currentdir/"");; ```.

If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for th",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

After script loading one can configure different parameters in `gStyle` object.; It is instance of the `TStyle` object and behaves like `gStyle` variable in ROOT. For instance,; to change stat format using to display value in stats box:. ```javascript; import { gStyle } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; gStyle.fStatFormat = '7.5g';; ```. There is also `settings` object which contains all other JSROOT settings. For instance,; one can configure custom format for different axes:. ```javascript; import { settings } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; settings.XValuesFormat = '4.2g';; settings.YValuesFormat = '6.1f';; ```. One also can use `build/jsroot.js` bundle to load all functionality at one and access it via `JSROOT` global handle:. ```javascript; <script src=""https://root.cern/js/latest/build/jsroot.js""></script>; <script>; // getting json string from somewhere; let obj = JSROOT.parse(root_json);; JSROOT.draw('plain', obj, 'colz');; </script>; ```. ### Use of JSON. It is strongly recommended to use JSON when communicating with ROOT application.; THttpServer provides a JSON representation for every registered object with an url address like:. http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json. Such JSON representation generated using the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. One could create JSON file for any ROOT object directly, just writing in the code:. ```cpp; obj->SaveAs(""file.json"");; ```. To access data from a remote web server, it is recommended to use the `httpRequest` method.; For instance to receive object from a THttpServer server one could do:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

After an object has been created, one can directly draw it. If HTML page has `<div>` element:. ```html; <div id=""drawing""></div>; ```. One could use the `draw` function:. ```javascript; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option. Here is complete [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_read_json) ans [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/read_json.htm):. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, draw, redraw, resize, cleanup } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/th2ul.json.gz"";; let obj = await httpRequest(filename, 'object');; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""lego"");; ```. In very seldom cases one need to access painter object, created in `draw()` function. This can be done via; handling Promise results like:. ```javascript; let painter = await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('Object type in painter', painter.getClassName());; ```. One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""drawing"", obj2, ""colz"");; ```. The `redraw` function will call `draw` if the drawing was not performed before. In the case when changing of HTML layout leads to resize of element with JSROOT drawing,; one should call `resize()` to let JSROOT adjust drawing size. One should do:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"");; ```. As second argument one could specify exact size for draw elements like:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"", { width: 500, height: 200 });; ```.

To correctly cleanup JSROOT drawings from HTML element, one should call:. ```javascript; cleanup(""drawing"");; ```. ### File API. JSROOT defines the TFile class, which can be used to access binary ROOT files.; One should always remember that all I/O operations are asynchronous in JSROOT.; Therefore promises are used to retrieve results when the I/O operation is completed.; For example, reading an object from a file and displaying it will look like:. ```javascript; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"";; let file = await openFile(filename);; let obj = await file.readObject(""hpxpy;1"");; await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('drawing completed');; ```.

To get access to selected branches, one should use `TSelector` class:. ```javascript; import { openFile } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/io.mjs';; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/draw.mjs';; import { TSelector, treeProcess } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/tree.mjs';. let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let tree = await file.readObject(""ntuple;1"");; let selector = new TSelector();. selector.AddBranch(""px"");; selector.AddBranch(""py"");. let cnt = 0, sumpx = 0, sumpy = 0;. selector.Begin = function() {; // function called before reading of TTree starts; }. selector.Process = function() {; // function called for every entry; sumpx += this.tgtobj.px;; sumpy += this.tgtobj.py;; cnt++;; }. selector.Terminate = function(res) {; if (!res || (cnt === 0)) return;; let meanpx = sumpx/cnt, meanpy = sumpy/cnt;; console.log(`Results meanpx = ${meanpx} meanpy = ${meanpy}`);; }. await treeProcess(tree, selector);; ```.

This examples shows how read TTree from binary file and create `TSelector` object.; Logically it is similar to original TSelector class - for every read entry `TSelector::Process()` method is called.; Selected branches can be accessed from **tgtobj** data member. At the end of tree reading `TSelector::Terminate()` method; will be called. As third parameter of treeProcess() function one could provide object with arguments. ```javascript; let args = { numentries: 1000, firstentry: 500 };; treeProcess(tree, selector, args);; ```. ### TGeo API. Any supported TGeo object can be drawn directly with normal `draw()` function. If necessary, one can create three.js model for supported object directly and use such model; separately. This can be done with the function:. ```javascript; import { build } from './path_to_jsroot/modules/geom/TGeoPainter.mjs';; let opt = { numfaces: 100000 };; let obj3d = build(obj, opt);; scene.add( obj3d );; ```.

When transparent volumes appeared in the model, one could use `produceRenderOrder()` function; to correctly set rendering order. It should be used as:. ```javascript; import { produceRenderOrder } from './path_to_jsroot/modules/geom/TGeoPainter.mjs';; produceRenderOrder(scene, camera.position, 'box');; ```. Following methods can be applied: ""box"", ""pnt"", ""size"", ""ray"" and ""dflt"". See more info in draw options description for TGeo classes. Here is [running example](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm#custom_html_geometry) and [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/blob/master/demo/tgeo_build.htm). ### Custom user class. There is [code example](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/tree/master/demo/custom) how custom user class can be implemented.; It shows usage of different draw options for the class and ability to access sub-elements of the object using specialized `expand` function. ### Use with Node.js. To install latest JSROOT release, just do:. ```bash; [shell] npm install jsroot; ```. To use in the Node.js scripts, one should add following line:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, makeSVG } from 'jsroot';; ```. Using JSROOT functionality, one can open binary ROOT files (local and remote), parse ROOT JSON,; create SVG output. For example, to create SVG image with lego plot, one should do:. ```javascript; import { openFile, makeSVG } from 'jsroot';; import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';. let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let obj = await file.readObject(""hpx;1"");; let svg = await makeSVG({ object: obj, option: ""lego2"", width: 1200, height: 800 });; writeFileSync(""lego2.svg"", svg);; ```. It is also possible to convert any JavaScript object into ROOT JSON string, using `toJSON()` function. Like:. ```javascript; import { toJSON, openFile, makeSVG } from 'jsro",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

[OpenUI5](http://openui5.org/) is a web toolkit for developers to ease and speed up the development of full-blown HTML5 web applications.; JSROOT provides `loadOpenui5` function to load supported OpenUI5:. ```javascript; <script type=""module"">; import { loadOpenui5 } from 'path_to_jsroot/modules/main.mjs';; let sap = await loadOpenui5();; sap.registerModulePath(""NavExample"", ""./"");; new sap.m.App ({; pages: [; new sap.m.Page({; title: ""Nav Container"",; enableScrolling : true,; content: [ new sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer({ name : ""NavExample"" })]; }); ]; }).placeAt(""content"");; </script>; ```. JSROOT uses <https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.128.0/> when no other source is specified. There are small details when using OpenUI5 with THttpServer. First of all, location of JSROOT modules should be specified; as `/jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs`. And then trying to access files from local disk, one should specify `/currentdir/` folder:. ```javascript; jQuery.sap.registerModulePath(""NavExample"", ""/currentdir/"");; ```. JSROOT provides [example](https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/openui5/) showing usage of JSROOT drawing in the OpenUI5,; [source code](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/tree/master/demo/openui5) can be found in repository. ### Migration v6 -> v7. * Core functionality should be imported from `main.mjs` module like:. ```javascript; import { create, parse, createHistogram, redraw } from 'https://root.cern/js/7.0.0/modules/main.mjs';; ```. * It is still possible to use `JSRoot.core.js` script, which provides very similar (but not identical!) functionality as with `v6` via global `JSROOT` object. * `JSROOT.define()` and `JSROOT.require()` functions only available after `JSRoot.core.js` loading. * Support of `require.js` and `openui5` loaders was removed. * Global hierarchy painter `JSROOT.hpainter` no longer existing, one can use `getHPainter` function:. ```java",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md

It is strongly recommended to use JSON when communicating with ROOT application.; THttpServer provides a JSON representation for every registered object with an url address like:. http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json. Such JSON representation generated using the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. One could create JSON file for any ROOT object directly, just writing in the code:. ```cpp; obj->SaveAs(""file.json"");; ```. To access data from a remote web server, it is recommended to use the `httpRequest` method.; For instance to receive object from a THttpServer server one could do:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest(""http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json"", ""object""); console.log('Read object of type', obj._typename);; ```. Function returns Promise, which provides parsed object (or Error in case of failure). If JSON string was obtained by different method, it could be parsed with `parse` function:. ```javascript; import { parse } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = parse(json_string);; ```. ### Objects drawing. After an object has been created, one can directly draw it. If HTML page has `<div>` element:. ```html; <div id=""drawing""></div>; ```. One could use the `draw` function:. ```javascript; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option.

In very seldom cases one need to access painter object, created in `draw()` function. This can be done via; handling Promise results like:. ```javascript; let painter = await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('Object type in painter', painter.getClassName());; ```. One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""drawing"", obj2, ""colz"");; ```. The `redraw` function will call `draw` if the drawing was not performed before. In the case when changing of HTML layout leads to resize of element with JSROOT drawing,; one should call `resize()` to let JSROOT adjust drawing size. One should do:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"");; ```. As second argument one could specify exact size for draw elements like:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"", { width: 500, height: 200 });; ```. To correctly cleanup JSROOT drawings from HTML element, one should call:. ```javascript; cleanup(""drawing"");; ```. ### File API.

It can be easily done with [CORS Everywhere plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/) for the Firefox browser or [Allow CORS plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) for the Chrome browser. Next solution - install JSROOT on the server hosting ROOT files. In such configuration JSROOT does not issue CORS requests, therefore server and browsers can be used with their default settings. A simplified variant of such solution - copy only the top index.htm file from JSROOT package and specify the full path to `modules/gui.mjs` script like:. ```javascript; <script type=""module"">; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/gui.mjs';; // ...; </script>; ```. In the main `<div>` element one can specify many custom parameters like one do it in URL string:. ```html; <div id=""simpleGUI"" path=""files/path"" files=""userfile1.root;subdir/usefile2.root"">; loading scripts ...; </div>; ```. ## Reading local ROOT files. JSROOT can read files from local file system using HTML5 FileReader functionality.; Main limitation here - user should interactively select files for reading.; There is button __""...""__ on the main JSROOT page, which starts file selection dialog.; If valid ROOT file is selected, JSROOT will be able to normally read content of such file. ## JSROOT with THttpServer. THttpServer provides http access to objects from running ROOT application.; JSROOT is used to implement the user interface in the web browsers. The layout of the main page coming from THttpServer is very similar to normal JSROOT page.; One could browse existing items and display them. A snapshot of running; server can be seen on the [demo page](https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/). One could also specify similar URL parameters to configure the displayed items and drawing options.

At many places in the analysis of the $\mbox{FCN}$ (the user; provided function), M must decide whether to be ""safe"" and waste a few; function calls in order to know where it is, or to be ""fast"" and attempt; to get the requested results with the fewest possible calls at a certain; risk of not obtaining the precision desired by the user. In order to; allow the user to influence these decisions, there is a M class; MnStrategy (see [api:strategy]) which the user can use to put different; settings. In the current release, this MnStrategy can be instantiated; with three different minimization quality levels for low (0), medium (1); and high (2) quality. Default settings for iteration cycles and; tolerances are initialized then. The default setting is set for medium; quality. Value 0 (low) indicates to M that it should economize function; calls; it is intended for cases where there are many variable parameters; and/or the function takes a long time to calculate and/or the user is; not interested in very precise values for parameter errors. On the other; hand, value 2 (high) indicates that M is allowed to waste function calls; in order to be sure that all values are precise; it is intended for; cases where the function is evaluated in a relatively short time and/or; where the parameter errors must be calculated reliably.

Optionally the user can select a different way; of dynamically allocating memory in the class StackAllacator for M , in; which case (and after an entire recompilation of the whole library) the; thread safety is lost. ## Floating-point precision ##. [install:epsmac]. M is entirely based on double precision. The actual floating point; precision of double precision (32–bit or 64–bit) is platform dependent; and can even vary on the same platform, depending on whether a floating; point number is read from memory a CPU register. The argument of the user's implementation of FCNBase::operator() is; therefore a std:vector$<$double$>$. M expects that the calculations; inside $\mbox{FCN}$ will be performed approximately to the same; accuracy. The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors. It is therefore recommended to make sure that all computations in; $\mbox{FCN}$, as well as all methods and functions called by; $\mbox{FCN}$, are done in double precision. If for some reason the; computations cannot be done to a precision comparable with that expected; by M , the user **must** inform M of this situation with setting a; different machine precision via the; MnMachinePrecision::setPrecision(double) method. With reduced precision, the user may find that certain features; sensitive to first and second differences ($\mbox{HESSE}$,; $\mbox{MINOS}$, $\mbox{CONTOURS}$) do not work properly, in; which case the calculations must be performed in higher precision. # How to use M #.

If the user wants; to interact with the parameters before minimization (fixing,; adding/removing limits), the minimal required interface cannot be used. ### What the user must supply ###. The user must supply to M. - a valid implementation of the FCNBase base class. - parameters with their starting values. - expected uncertainties on the parameters. The input parameters can be simply defined via an; std::vector$<$double$>$, which means that all parameters are variables.; If the user wants fix a parameter or put limits on it before; minimization, they have to instantiate a MnUserParameters object and then; add parameters one by one, giving them a name, value, uncertainty. Once; all parameters are added to MnUserParameters, they can fix a parameter or; put limits on another one before handing them over to Minuit for; minimization. ### What the user can supply ###. Optionally the user can supply their own gradient calculator by; implementing the FCNGradientBase interface or supply a full covariance; matrix for input if one is available. The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##. Two use cases are addressed for minimization:. - The user just wants the function to be minimized in one go. - The user wants to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ in several; minimization steps, re-using the result of the preceeding; minimization in the next step and change parameters in between; (fix/release/put limits on them, etc.). How M minimizations can be performed is shown in [example:main]. ### Direct usage of minimizers ###.

Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###. M takes care that all information is treated in an optimal and correct; way if the user interacts with the parameters between two minimizations.; MnMigrad retains the result of the last minimization and uses this as; input for the next step. Between two minimization requests to MnMigrad; the user can fix or release parameters, put limits on them or remove; limits from them. Each instance of a MnMigrad object maintains its own; state and one can have multiple instances of MnMigrad objects. ### M fails to find a minimum ###. If M fails to find a minimum, the user is notified by a warning message; issued by M when running into troubles. Problems can be:. - a bug in M. - an error in the $\mbox{FCN}$. - a highly difficult problem (usually strong correlations among; parameters). - floating–point precision. ## The output from minimization ##. ### The FunctionMinimum ###. The output of the minimizers is the FunctionMinimum. The FunctionMinimum; contains the result of the minimization in both internal parameter; representation and external parameter representation. ### User representable format: MnUserParameterState ###. On request, the result of the minimization is transformed into a user; representable format for parameters and errors, the; MnUserParameterState. ### Access values, errors, covariance ###. The result can be accessed via methods like; MnUserParameterState::value(unsigned int n) and; MnUserParameterState::error(unsigned int n), where $n$ is the index of; the parameter in the list of parameters defined by the user. ### Printout of the result ###.

The goal of M — to be able to minimize and analyze parameter errors for; all possible user functions with any number of variable parameters — is; of course impossible to realise, even in principle, in a finite amount; of time. In practice, some assumptions must be made about the behaviour; of the function in order to avoid evaluating it at all possible points.; In this chapter we give some hints on how the user can help M to make; the right assumptions. ## Which minimizer to use ##. One of the historically interesting advantages of M is that it was; probably the first minimization program to offer the user a choice of; several minimization algorithms. This could be taken as a reflection of; the fact that none of the algorithms known at that time were good enough; to be universal, so users were encouraged to find the one that worked; best for them. Since then, algorithms have improved considerably, but M; still offers several, mostly so that old users will not feel cheated,; but also to help the occasional user who does manage to defeat the best; algorithms.

This could be taken as a reflection of; the fact that none of the algorithms known at that time were good enough; to be universal, so users were encouraged to find the one that worked; best for them. Since then, algorithms have improved considerably, but M; still offers several, mostly so that old users will not feel cheated,; but also to help the occasional user who does manage to defeat the best; algorithms. M currently offers four applications which can be used to; find a smaller function value, in addition to $\mbox{MINOS}$, which; will retain a smaller function value if it stumbles on one unexpectedly.; The objects which can be used to minimize are:. ### $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ ###. This is the best minimizer for nearly all functions. It is a; variable-metric method with inexact line search, a stable metric; updating scheme, and checks for positive-definiteness. It will run; faster if you instantiate it with a low–level MnStrategy and will be; more reliable if you instantiate it with a high–level MnStrategy; (although the latter option may not help much). Its main weakness is; that it depends heavily on knowledge of the first derivatives, and fails; miserably if they are very inaccurate. If first derivatives are a; problem, they can be calculated analytically inside $\mbox{FCN}$; (see [howto:fcn]) or if this is not feasible, the user can try to; improve the accuracy of M 's numerical approximation by adjusting values; of MnMachinePrecision and/or MnStrategy (see [api:epsmac] and; [api:strategy]). ### $\mbox{MINIMIZE}$ ###. This is equivalent to $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, except that if; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ fails, it reverts to $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$ and then; calls $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ again. ### $\mbox{SCAN}$ ###.

Although M will of course solve easy problems faster than complicated; ones, it is not intended for the repeated solution of identically; parametrized problems (such as track fitting in a detector) where a; specialized program will in general be much more efficient. ## Further remarks ##.

It is especially suited to handle; difficult problems, including those which may require guidance in order; to find the correct solution. ## What M is not intended to do ##. Although M will of course solve easy problems faster than complicated; ones, it is not intended for the repeated solution of identically; parametrized problems (such as track fitting in a detector) where a; specialized program will in general be much more efficient. ## Further remarks ##.

Further discussion of the effects of parameter limits may be found in; the last chapter. ## M strategy ##. At many places in the analysis of the $\mbox{FCN}$ (the user; provided function), M must decide whether to be ""safe"" and waste a few; function calls in order to know where it is, or to be ""fast"" and attempt; to get the requested results with the fewest possible calls at a certain; risk of not obtaining the precision desired by the user. In order to; allow the user to influence these decisions, there is a M class; MnStrategy (see [api:strategy]) which the user can use to put different; settings. In the current release, this MnStrategy can be instantiated; with three different minimization quality levels for low (0), medium (1); and high (2) quality. Default settings for iteration cycles and; tolerances are initialized then. The default setting is set for medium; quality. Value 0 (low) indicates to M that it should economize function; calls; it is intended for cases where there are many variable parameters; and/or the function takes a long time to calculate and/or the user is; not interested in very precise values for parameter errors. On the other; hand, value 2 (high) indicates that M is allowed to waste function calls; in order to be sure that all values are precise; it is intended for; cases where the function is evaluated in a relatively short time and/or; where the parameter errors must be calculated reliably. In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,;",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###. The M processor $\mbox{MINOS}$ (MnMinos, see [api:minos]) was; probably the first, and may still be the only, generally available; program to calculate parameter errors taking into account both parameter; correlations and non-linearities.

The version numbers of M follow the release numbers of the SEAL project; @bib-SEAL at CERN @bib-CERN. ### From to ###. The program is entirely written in standard portable . M does not depend; on any external library. In its minimal usage the user must only provide; an implementation of the FCNBase class to M and parameters and; uncertainties in form of std::vector containers. ### Memory allocation and thread safety ###. Differently to the version of M , the version has its own memory manager; (StackAllocator. The user can select between the standard dynamic memory; allocation and deallocation (default) and performance-optimized; stack–like allocation (optional). However, the library is not thread; save using stack–allocation. ### M parameters ###. Differently to the version of M there is no limit on the number of; parameters, variable or non-variable. Memory allocation is done; dynamically according to the actual needs and ""on demand"". There is no; protection against an upper limit on the number of parameters, however; the ""technolog",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

However, the library is not thread; save using stack–allocation. ### M parameters ###. Differently to the version of M there is no limit on the number of; parameters, variable or non-variable. Memory allocation is done; dynamically according to the actual needs and ""on demand"". There is no; protection against an upper limit on the number of parameters, however; the ""technological"" limitations of M can be seen around a maximum of 15; free parameters at a time. ## Interference with other packages ##. The new M has been designed to interfere as little as possible with; other programs or packages which may be loaded at the same time. M is; thread safe by default. Optionally the user can select a different way; of dynamically allocating memory in the class StackAllacator for M , in; which case (and after an entire recompilation of the whole library) the; thread safety is lost. ## Floating-point precision ##. [install:epsmac]. M is entirely based on double precision. The actual floating point; precision of double precision (32–bit or 64–bit) is platform dependent; and can even vary on the same platform, depending on whether a floating; point number is read from memory a CPU register. The argument of the user's implementation of FCNBase::operator() is; therefore a std:vector$<$double$>$. M expects that the calculations; inside $\mbox{FCN}$ will be performed approximately to the same; accuracy. The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors. It is therefore recommended to make sure that all computations in; $\mbox{FCN}$, as well as all methods and functions called by; $\mbox{FCN}",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

By default first derivatives are calculated numerically by M . In case; the user wants to supply their own gradient calculator (e.g. analytical; derivatives), they need to implement the FCNGradientBase interface. ![](figures/fcngradientbase.png). The size of the output vector is the same as of the input one. The same; is true for the position of the elements (first derivative of the; function with respect to the $n_\mathrm{th}$ variable has index $n$ in; the output vector). ## M parameters ##. Interaction with the parameters of the function are essential both for M; and the user. Different interfaces are provided, depending on the level; of interaction. ### Minimal required interface ###. Starting values of parameters and uncertainties can be provided to M by; the user via std::vector$<$double$>$ vector containers. Any interaction; with the parameters before minimization (fix, release, limits, etc.) is; not possible then. Optionally if the user wants to provide starting values for the; covariance, they have to provide the values in a std::vector$<$double$>$; vector container stored in upper triangular packed storage format (see; [api:covariance]). ### MnUserParameters ###. A more functional interface to the user parameters is provided through M; via the class MnUserParameters. The user can add parameters giving them; a name and starting values. More information can be found in; [api:parameters]. ### MnUserCovariance ###. The user can (optionally) provide a covariance matrix as input using the; class MnUserCovariance. More information can be found in; [api:covariance]. ### MnUserParameterState ###. The MnUserParameterState contains the parameters (MnUserParameters) and; covariance (MnUserCovariance). The MnUserParameterState has to main; purposes:. - It can be used as input to minimization. - The result of the minimization is transformed ",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

Once; all parameters are added to MnUserParameters, they can fix a parameter or; put limits on another one before handing them over to Minuit for; minimization. ### What the user can supply ###. Optionally the user can supply their own gradient calculator by; implementing the FCNGradientBase interface or supply a full covariance; matrix for input if one is available. The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##. Two use cases are addressed for minimization:. - The user just wants the function to be minimized in one go. - The user wants to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ in several; minimization steps, re-using the result of the preceeding; minimization in the next step and change parameters in between; (fix/release/put limits on them, etc.). How M minimizations can be performed is shown in [example:main]. ### Direct usage of minimizers ###. Minimizers such as the VariableMetricMinimizer are designed as; state-less minimization engines, which means that they do not depend on; the current function and its parameters. Any $\mbox{FCN}$ function; can be minimized with the same minimizer. The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:c",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###. M takes care that all information is treated in an optimal and correct; way if the user interacts with the parameters between two minimizations.; MnMigrad retains the result of the last minimization and uses this as; input for the next step. Between two minimization requests to MnMigrad; the user can fix or release parameters, put limits on them or remove; limits from them. Each instance of a MnMigrad object maintains its own; state and one can have multiple instances of MnMigrad objects. ### M fails to find a minimum ###. If M fails to find a minimum, the user is notified by a warning message; issued by M when running into troubles. Problems can be:. - a bug in M. - an error in the $\mbox{FCN}$. - a highly difficult problem (usually strong correlations among; parameters). - floating–point precision. ## The output from minimization ##. ### The FunctionMinimum ###. The output of the minimizers is the FunctionMinimum. The FunctionMinimum; contains the result of the minimization in both internal parameter; representation and external parameter representation. ### User representable format: MnUserParameterState ###. On request, the result of the minimization is transformed into a user; representable format for parameters and errors, the; MnUserParameterState. ### Access values, errors, covari",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

However, it gives no reliable; information about parameter errors, no information whatsoever about; parameter correlations, and worst of all cannot be expected to converge; accurately to the minimum in a finite time. Its estimate of the; *expected distance to the minimum* $\mbox{EDM}$ is largely fantasy,; so it would not even know if it did converge. ## Floating point precision ##. M figures out at execution time the machine precision [api:epsmac], and; assumes that $\mbox{FCN}$ provides about the same precision. That; means not just the length of the numbers used and returned by; $\mbox{FCN}$, but the actual mathematical accuracy of the; calculations. Section [install:epsmac] describes what to do if this is; not the case. ## Parameter limits ##. Putting limits (absolute bounds) on the allowed values for a given; parameter, causes M to make a non-linear transformation of its own; internal parameter values to obtain the (external) parameter values; passed to $\mbox{FCN}$. To understand the adverse effect of limits,; see [intro:limits]. Basically, the use of limits should be avoided unless needed to keep the; parameter inside a desired range. If parameter limits are needed, in spite of the effects described in; Chapter One, then the user should be aware of the following techniques; to alleviate problems caused by limits. ### Getting the Right Minimum with Limits ###. If $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ converges normally to a point where no parameter; is near one of its limits, then the existence of limits has probably not; prevented M from finding the right minimum.

Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; printout from the $\mbox{MINOS}$ result to be able to determine; whether the results are reliable or not. ## Fixing and releasing parameters ##.

To follow the current release process the user is referred to the M; homepage @bib-C++MINUIT. M was re–implemented in from 2002–2004, but the functionality is largely; compatible with the one of the version. The usage is different in the; sense that the re–write from to was done by its signification and not; literally (with minor exceptions). Applications such as; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ have a corresponding class MnMigrad, M ""commands""; became classes or methods of classes according to their purpose. Users; familiar with the version of M , who have not yet used releases from the; version, should however read this manual, in order to adapt to the; changes as well as to discover the new features and easier ways of using; old features. ## Install M using autoconf/make ##. For each release of M a tar.gz file is provided for downloading from the; M homepage @bib-C++MINUIT. For non-UNIX platforms please refer to the M; homepage. The necessary steps to follow are:. 1. download the tar.gz by clicking on it from the release page. 2. unzip it:. $ unzip Minuit-x.x.x.tar.gz. 3. untar it:. $ tar xvf Minuit-x.x.x.tar. 4. step down to the created Minuit-x.x.x directory:. $ cd Minuit-x.x.x/. 5. run the ""configure"" script:. $ ./configure. 6. run ""make"" to compile the source code:. $ make. 7. run ""make check"" to create the executable example:. $ make check. 8. run the executable example:. $ tests/MnTutorial/Quad4FMain.C. The output should look like that:.

The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors. It is therefore recommended to make sure that all computations in; $\mbox{FCN}$, as well as all methods and functions called by; $\mbox{FCN}$, are done in double precision. If for some reason the; computations cannot be done to a precision comparable with that expected; by M , the user **must** inform M of this situation with setting a; different machine precision via the; MnMachinePrecision::setPrecision(double) method. With reduced precision, the user may find that certain features; sensitive to first and second differences ($\mbox{HESSE}$,; $\mbox{MINOS}$, $\mbox{CONTOURS}$) do not work properly, in; which case the calculations must be performed in higher precision. # How to use M #. [howto:howto]. ## The $\mbox{FCN}$ Function ##. [howto:fcn]. The user must always implement a derived class of FCNBase (the; ""$\mbox{FCN}$"") which calculates the function value to be minimized; or analyzed. ![](figures/fcnbase.png). Note that when M is being used through an intermediate package such as; HippoDraw @bib-HippoDraw, then the user's $\mbox{FCN}$ may be; supplied by the this package. The name of the user's class to implement the FCNBase interface may be; chosen freely (in documentation we give it the generic name; $\mbox{FCN}$). ### FCNBase::operator()(const std::vector$<$double$>$&) ###. The meaning of the vector of parameters std::vector$<$double$>$ in the; argument of FCNBase::operator() are of course defined by the user, who; uses the values of those parameters to calculate their function value.

External parameters can be specified as; std::vector$<$double$>$ or as MnUserParameters. The return value is; always a MnUserParameterState. The optional argument $\mbox{maxcalls}$ specifies the (approximate); maximum number of function calls after which the calculation will be; stopped. ## MnMachinePrecision ##. [api:epsmac]. ### MnMachinePrecision() ###. M determines the nominal precision itself in the default constructor; MnMachinePrecision(). ### setPrecision(double eps) ###. Informs M that the relative floating point arithmetic precision is; $\mbox{eps}$. The method can be used to override M 's own; determination, when the user knows that the $\mbox{FCN}$ function; value is not calculated to the nominal machine accuracy. Typical values; of $\mbox{eps}$ are between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-14}$. ## MnMigrad and VariableMetricMinimizer ##. [api:migrad]. MnMigrad provides minimization of the function by the method of; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the most efficient and complete single method,; recommended for general functions (see also [api:minimize]), and the; functionality for parameters interaction. It also retains the result; from the last minimization in case the user may want to do subsequent; minimization steps with parameter interactions in between the; minimization requests. The minimization is done by the; VariableMetricMinimizer. Minimization of the function can be done by; directly using the VariableMetricMinimizer if no parameters interaction; is required. The minimization produces as a by-product the error matrix; of the parameters, which is usually reliable unless warning messages are; produced. ### MnMigrad(const FCNBase&, const std::vector$<$double$>$&, const std::vector$<$double$>$&, unsigned int) ###. Constructor for the minimal required interface: $\mbox{FCN}$ and; starting values for parameters and uncertainties. Optional the strategy; level in MnStrategy can be specified. ### MnMigrad(const FCNBase&, const MnUserParameters&, unsigned int) ###",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

The result of the minimization; (internal covariance matrix) is converted into the user representable; format. It can also be used as input prior to the minimization. The size; of the covariance matrix is according to the number of variable; parameters (free and limited). ### MnUserCovariance(const std::vector$<$double$>$&, unsigned int nrow) ###. Construct from data, positions of the elements in the array are arranged; according to the packed storage format. The size of the array must be; $nrow*(nrow+1)/2$. The array must contain the upper triangular part of; the symmetric matrix packed sequentially, column by column, so that; arr(0) contains covar(0,0), arr(1) and arr(2) contain covar(0,1) and; covar(1,1) respectively, and so on. The number of rows (columns) has to; be specified. ### MnUserCovariance(unsigned int nrow) ###. Specify the number of rows (columns) at instantiation. It will allocate; an array of the length $nrow*(nrow+1)/2$ and initialize it to $0$.; Elements can then be set using the method operator()(unsigned int,; unsigned int). ### MnUserCovariance::operator()(unsigned int, unsigned int) ###. Individual elements can be accessed via the operator(), both for reading; and writing. ## MnUserParameters ##. [api:parameters] MnUserParameters is the main class for user interaction; with the parameters. It serves both as input to the minimization as well; as output as the result of the minimization is converted into the user; representable format in order to allow for further interaction.; Parameters for M can be added (defined) specifying a name, value and; initial uncertainty. ### add(...) ###. The method MnUserParameters::add(...) is overloaded for three kind of; parameters:. - add(const char\*, double, double) for adding a free variable; parameter. - add(const char\*, double, double, double, double) for adding a; variable parameter with limits (lower and upper). - add(const char\*, double)",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M; is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$. Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level. Assuming that the user knows what the normalization of their; $\mbox{FCN}$ means, and also that they are interested in parameter; errors, the user can change the error definition which allows them to; define what they means by one ""error"", in terms of the change in the; $\mbox{FCN}$ value which should be caused by changing one parameter; by one ""error"". If the $\mbox{FCN}$ is the usual chisquare function; (defined below) and if the user wants the usual one-standard-deviation; errors, then the error definition (return value of the FCNBase::up(); method, see [howto:errordef]) should be $1.0$. If the $\mbox{FCN}$; is a negative-log-likelihood function, then the one-standard-deviation; value for FCNBase::up() to return is $0.5",MatchSource.DOCS,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md

M offers a procedure for finding $\mbox{FCN}$ $\mbox{CONTOURS}$; (provided via the class MnContours, see [api:contours]). The contour calculated by MnContours::operator() is dynamic, in the; sense that it represents the minimum of $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to; all the other $\mbox{npar - 2}$ parameters (if any). In statistical; terms, this means that MnContours takes account of the correlations; between the two parameters being plotted, and all the other variable; parameters, using a procedure analogous to that of $\mbox{MINOS}$.; (If this feature is not wanted, then the other parameters must be fixed; before calling $\mbox{CONTOURS}$.) MnContours provides the actual; coordinates of the points around the contour, suitable for plotting with; a graphics routine or by hand (using MnPlot, see [api:plot]). The points; are given in counter-clockwise order around the contour. Only one; contour is calculated per command, and the level is; $\displaystyle F_{\mathrm{min}} + \mbox{up}$. where $\mbox{up}$; is the return value of FCNBase::up() specified by the user (usually 1.0; by default). The number of points to be calculated is chosen by the user; (default is 20). As a by-product, $\mbox{CONTOURS}$ provides the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors of the two parameters in question, since these; are just the extreme points of the contour (use the; MnContours::contour(...) method in order to get the points of the; contour and the ones of the $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors).; MnContours::operator() returns a; std::vector$<$std::pair$<$double,double$> >$ of (x,y) points. Using; MnPlot::operator() will generate a text graphics plot in the terminal. # M installation #. ## M releases ##.

M does not depend; on any external library.

The user can select between the standard dynamic memory; allocation and deallocation (default) and performance-optimized; stack–like allocation (optional). However, the library is not thread; save using stack–allocation. ### M parameters ###. Differently to the version of M there is no limit on the number of; parameters, variable or non-variable.

[howto:howto]. ## The $\mbox{FCN}$ Function ##. [howto:fcn]. The user must always implement a derived class of FCNBase (the; ""$\mbox{FCN}$"") which calculates the function value to be minimized; or analyzed. ![](figures/fcnbase.png). Note that when M is being used through an intermediate package such as; HippoDraw @bib-HippoDraw, then the user's $\mbox{FCN}$ may be; supplied by the this package. The name of the user's class to implement the FCNBase interface may be; chosen freely (in documentation we give it the generic name; $\mbox{FCN}$). ### FCNBase::operator()(const std::vector$<$double$>$&) ###. The meaning of the vector of parameters std::vector$<$double$>$ in the; argument of FCNBase::operator() are of course defined by the user, who; uses the values of those parameters to calculate their function value. The; order and the position of these parameters is strictly the one specified; by the user when supplying the starting values for minimization. The starting values must be specified by the user, either via an; std::vector$<$double$>$ or the MnUserParameters (see [api:parameters]); supplied as input to the M minimizers such as VariableMetricMinimizer or; MnMigrad (see [api:migrad]). Later values are determined by M as it; searches for the minimum or performs whatever analysis is requested by; the user. ### FCNBase::up() ###.

[howto:errordef] Returns the value of $\mbox{up}$ (default value; $= 1.$), defining parameter errors.
