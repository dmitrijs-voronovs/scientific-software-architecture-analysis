Function based: Hamiltonian / collapse operators expressed using [qobj, func] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients of the Hamiltonian (or collapse operators) are expressed in the Python functions.; String (Cython) based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, string] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings. The resulting Hamiltonian is then compiled into C code using Cython and executed.; Hamiltonian function (outdated): The Hamiltonian is itself a Python function with time-dependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor.

Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page. Function Based Time Dependence¶; A very general way to write a time-dependent Hamiltonian or collapse operator is by using Python functions as the time-dependent coefficients. To accomplish this, we need to write a Python function that returns the time-dependent coefficient. Additionally, we need to tell QuTiP that a given Hamiltonian or collapse operator should be associated with a given Python function. To do this, one needs to specify operator-function pairs in list format: [Op, py_coeff], where Op is a given Hamiltonian or collapse operator and py_coeff is the name of the Python function ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

Calling the solvers is the same as before:; >>> output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). We can also use the args variable in the same manner as before, however we must rewrite our string term to read: 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)':; H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]; args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}; output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args). Important; Naming your args variables e or pi will mess things up when using the string-based format. Collapse operators are handled in the exact same way. Function Based Hamiltonian¶; In the previous version of QuTiP, the simulation of time-dependent problems required writing the Hamiltonian itself as a Python function. However, this method does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators, and is therefore more restrictive. Furthermore, it is less efficient than the other methods for all but the most basic of Hamiltonians (see the next section for a comparison of times.). In this format, the entire Hamiltonian is written as a Python function:; def Hfunc(t, args):; H0 = args[0]; H1 = args[1]; w = 9 * exp(-(t/5.)**2); return H0 - w * H1. where the args variable must always be given, and is now a list of Hamiltonian terms: args=[H0, H1]. In this format, our call to the master equation is now:; >>> output = mesolve(Hfunc, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args=[H0, H1]). We cannot evaluate time-dependent collapse operators in this format, so we can not simulate the previous harmonic oscillator decay example.

Because the qutip.parfor function uses the built-in Python multiprocessing functionality, in calling the solver inside a parfor loop, each thread will try to generate compiled code with the same file name, leading to a crash. To get around this problem you can call the qutip.rhs_generate function to compile simulation into C code before calling parfor.

The two main evolution solvers in QuTiP, qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, discussed in Lindblad Master Equation Solver and Monte Carlo Solver respectively, are capable of handling time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse terms. There are, in general, three different ways to implement time-dependent problems in QuTiP:. Function based: Hamiltonian / collapse operators expressed using [qobj, func] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients of the Hamiltonian (or collapse operators) are expressed in the Python functions.; String (Cython) based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, string] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings. The resulting Hamiltonian is then compiled into C code using Cython and executed.; Hamiltonian function (outdated): The Hamiltonian is itself a Python function with time-dependence.

This is fine for problems that are specialized, or that we only want to run once. However, in many cases, we would like to change the parameters of the problem in only one location (usually at the top of the script), and not have to worry about manually changing the values on each run.

Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. When repeatedly simulating a system where only the time-dependent variables, or initial state change, it is possible to reuse the Hamiltonian data stored in QuTiP and there by avoid spending time needlessly preparing the Hamiltonian and collapse terms for simulation. To turn on the the reuse features, we must pass a qutip.Options object with the rhs_reuse flag turned on. Instructions on setting flags are found in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers.

Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. If you can write you time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) then you may use this method:; 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil',; 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1',; 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma',; 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p',; 'modf', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc'. Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page.

The details of this meta-programming will be published in due course. however, in short, this can lead to a substantial reduction in time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals.

Using the args variable¶; In the previous example we hardcoded all of the variables, driving amplitude \(A\) and width \(\sigma\), with their numerical values. This is fine for problems that are specialized, or that we only want to run once. However, in many cases, we would like to change the parameters of the problem in only one location (usually at the top of the script), and not have to worry about manually changing the values on each run. QuTiP allows you to accomplish this using the keyword args as an input to the solvers. For instance, instead of explicitly writing 9 for the amplitude and 5 for the width of the gaussian driving term, we can make us of the args variable:; def H1_coeff(t, args):; return args['A'] * exp(-(t/args['sigma'])**2). or equivalently:; def H1_coeff(t, ar",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

Often, we also need to import the Numpy and Matplotlib libraries with:; In [2]: import numpy as np. Note that, in the rest of the documentation, functions are written using qutip.module.function() notation which links to the corresponding function in the QuTiP API: Functions.

We can create a Qobj with a user defined data set by passing a list or array of data into the Qobj:; In [4]: Qobj([1,2,3,4,5]); Out[4]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 2.]; [ 3.]; [ 4.]; [ 5.]].

Notice how both the dims and shape change according to the input data. Although dims and shape appear to have the same function, the difference will become quite clear in the section on tensor products and partial traces. Note; If you are running QuTiP from a python script you must use the print function to view the Qobj attributes. States and operators¶; Manually specifying the data for each quantum object is inefficient. Even more so when most objects correspond to commonly used types such as the ladder operators of a harmonic oscillator, the Pauli spin operators for a two-level system, or state vectors such as Fock states. Therefore, QuTiP includes predefined objects for a variety of states:. States; Command (# means optional); Inputs. Fock state ket vector; basis(N,#m) / fock(N,#m); N = number of levels in Hilbert space,; m = level containing excitation; (0 if no m given). Fock density matrix; (outer product of basis); fock_dm(N,#p); same as basis(N,m) / fock(N,m). Coherent state; coherent(N,alpha); alpha = complex number (eigenvalue); for requested coherent state.

Notice how the color and point markers change for each set of data. Again, we have had to call add_points twice because adding more than one set of multiple data points is not supported by the add_points function.; What if we want to vary the color of our points. We can tell the qutip.Bloch class to vary the color of each point according to the colors listed in the b.point_color list (see Configuring the Bloch sphere below). Again after clear():; In [39]: xp=[cos(th) for th in linspace(0,2*pi,20)]. In [40]: yp=[sin(th) for th in linspace(0,2*pi,20)]. In [41]: zp=zeros(20). In [42]: pnts=[xp,yp,zp]. In [43]: b.add_points(pnts,'m') # <-- add a 'm' string to signify 'multi' colored points. In [44]: b.show(). Now, the data points cycle through a variety of predefined colors. Now lets add another set of points, but this time we want the set to be a single color, representing say a qubit going from the \(\left|\rm up\right>\) state to the \(\left|\rm down\right>\) state in the y-z plane:; In [45]: xz=zeros(20). In [46]: yz=[sin(th) for th in linspace(0,pi,20)]. In [47]: zz=[cos(th) for th in linspace(0,pi,20)]. In [48]: b.add_points([xz,yz,zz]) # no 'm'. In [49]: b.show(). Again, the same plot can be generated using the qutip.Bloch3d class by replacing Bloch with Bloch3d:. A more slick way of using this ‘multi’ color feature is also given in the example, where we set the color of the markers as a function of time. Differences Between Bloch and Bloch3d¶; While in general the Bloch and Bloch3d classes are interchangeable, there are some important differences to consider when choosing between them. The Bloch class uses Matplotlib to generate figures. As such, the data plotted on the sphere is in reality just a 2D object. In contrast the Bloch3d class uses the 3D rendering engine from VTK via mayavi to generate the sphere and the included data. In this sense the Bloch3d class is",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-bloch.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-bloch.html

Important; Updated in QuTiP version 3.0. Introduction¶; When studying the dynamics of a two-level system, it is often convent to visualize the state of the system by plotting the state-vector or density matrix on the Bloch sphere. In QuTiP, we have created two different classes to allow for easy creation and manipulation of data sets, both vectors and data points, on the Bloch sphere. The qutip.Bloch class, uses Matplotlib to render the Bloch sphere, where as qutip.Bloch3d uses the Mayavi rendering engine to generate a more faithful 3D reconstruction of the Bloch sphere.

As an example, we can add a single data point:; In [6]: pnt=[1/sqrt(3),1/sqrt(3),1/sqrt(3)]. In [7]: b.add_points(pnt). In [8]: b.show(). and then a single vector:; In [9]: vec=[0,1,0].

Replacing b=Bloch() with b=Bloch3d() in the above code generates the following 3D Bloch sphere.

Animating with the Bloch sphere¶; The Bloch class was designed from the outset to generate animations. To animate a set of vectors or data points the basic idea is: plot the data at time t1, save the sphere, clear the sphere, plot data at t2,... The Bloch sphere will automatically number the output file based on how many times the object has been saved (this is stored in b.savenum). The easiest way to animate data on the Bloch sphere is to use the save() method and generate a series of images to convert into an animation. However, as of Matplotlib version 1.1, creating animations is built-in. We will demonstrate both methods by looking at the decay of a qubit on the bloch sphere. Example: Qubit Decay¶; The code for calculating the expectation values for the Pauli spin operators of a qubit decay is given below. This code is common to both animation examples.; from qutip import *; from scipy import *; def qubit_integrate(w, theta, gamma1, gamma2, psi0, tlist):; # operators and the hamiltonian; sx = sigmax(); sy = sigmay(); sz = sigmaz(); sm = sigmam(); H = w * (cos(theta) * sz + sin(theta) * sx); # collapse operators; c_op_list = []; n_th = 0.5 # temperatur",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-bloch.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-bloch.html

Generating Images for Animation¶; An example of generating images for generating an animation outside of Python is given below:; b=Bloch(); b.vector_color = ['r']; b.view=[-40,30]; for i in xrange(len(sx)):; b.clear(); b.add_vectors([sin(theta),0,cos(theta)]); b.add_points([sx[:i+1],sy[:i+1],sz[:i+1]]); b.save(dirc='temp') #saving images to temp directory in current working directory. Generating an animation using ffmpeg (for example) is fairly simple:; ffmpeg -r 20 -b 1800 -i bloch_%01d.png bloch.mp4. Directly Generating an Animation¶. Important; Generating animations directly from Matplotlib requires installing either mencoder or ffmpeg. While either choice works on linux, it is best to choose ffmpeg when running on the Mac.

An Overview of the Eseries Class¶. Exponential-series representation of time-dependent quantum objects¶; The eseries object in QuTiP is a representation of an exponential-series expansion of time-dependent quantum objects (a concept borrowed from the quantum optics toolbox).; An exponential series is parameterized by its amplitude coefficients \(c_i\) and rates \(r_i\), so that the series takes the form \(E(t) = \sum_i c_i e^{r_it}\). The coefficients are typically quantum objects (type Qobj: states, operators, etc.), so that the value of the eseries also is a quantum object, and the rates can be either real or complex numbers (describing decay rates and oscillation frequencies, respectively). Note that all amplitude coefficients in an exponential series must be of the same dimensions and composition.; In QuTiP, an exponential series object is constructed by creating an instance of the class qutip.eseries:; In [3]: es1 = eseries(sigmax(), 1j). where the first argument is the amplitude coefficient (here, the sigma-X operator), and the second argument is the rate. The eseries in this example represents the time-dependent operator \(\sigma_x e^{i t}\).; To add more terms to an qutip.eseries object we simply add objects using the + operator:; In [4]: omega=1.0. In [5]: es2 = (eseries(0.5 * sigmax(), 1j * omega) +; ...: eseries(0.5 * sigmax",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-eseries.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-eseries.html

Note the expectation value of the qutip.eseries object, expect(rho, es3), itself is an qutip.eseries, but with amplitude coefficients that are C-numbers instead of quantum operators. To evaluate the C-number qutip.eseries at the times times we use esval(es3_expect, times), or, equivalently, es3_expect.value(times). Applications of exponential series¶; The exponential series formalism can be useful for the time-evolution of quantum systems. One approach to calculating the time evolution of a quantum system is to diagonalize its Hamiltonian (or Liouvillian, for dissipative systems) and to express the propagator (e.g., \(\exp(-iHt) \rho \exp(iHt)\)) as an exponential series.; The QuTiP function qutip.essolve.ode2es and qutip.essolve use this method to evolve quantum systems in time. The exponential series approach is particularly suitable for cases when the same system is to be evolved for many different initial states, since the diagonalization only needs to be performed once (as opposed to e.g. the ode solver that would need to be ran independently for each initial state).; As an example, consider a spin-1/2 with a Hamiltonian pointing in the \(\sigma_z\) direction, and that is subject to noise causing relaxation. For a spin originally is in the up state, we can create an qutip.eseries object describing its dynamics by using the qutip.es2ode function:; In [16]: psi0 = basis(2,1). In [17]: H = sigmaz(). In [18]: L = liouvillian(H, [sqrt(1.0) * destroy(2)]). In [19]: es = ode2es(L, psi0).

In combination with the examples, which can be found on the project web page http://qutip.org/tutorials.html, this guide should provide a more or less complete overview. In addition, the API documentation for each function is located at after of this guide. Organization¶; QuTiP is designed to be a general framework for solving quantum mechanics problems such as systems composed of few-level quantum systems and harmonic oscillators. To this end, QuTiP is built from a large (and ever growing) library of functions and classes; from qutip.states.basis to qutip.wigner. The general organization of QuTiP, highlighting the important API available to the user, is shown in the QuTiP tree-diagram of user accessible functions and classes.

Almost any program can handle this file format.; The qutip.fileio.file_data_store takes two mandatory and three optional arguments:; >>> file_data_store(filename, data, numtype=""complex"", numformat=""decimal"", sep="",""). where filename is the name of the file, data is the data to be written to the file (must be a numpy array), numtype (optional) is a flag indicating numerical type that can take values complex or real, numformat (optional) specifies the numerical format that can take the values exp for the format 1.0e1 and decimal for the format 10.0, and sep (optional) is an arbitrary single-character field separator (usually a tab, space, comma, semicolon, etc.).; A common use for the qutip.fileio.file_data_store function is to store the expectation values of a set of operators for a sequence of times, e.g., as returned by the qutip.mesolve function, which is what the following example does:; In [17]: a =",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-saving.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-saving.html

Loading data previously stored using qutip.fileio.file_data_store (or some other software) is a even easier. Regardless of which deliminator was used, if data was stored as complex or real numbers, if it is in decimal or exponential form, the data can be loaded using the qutip.fileio.file_data_read, which only takes the filename as mandatory argument.; In [31]: input_data = file_data_read('expect.dat').

Storing and loading QuTiP objects¶; To store and load arbitrary QuTiP related objects (qutip.Qobj, qutip.solver.Result, etc.) there are two functions: qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload. The function qutip.fileio.qsave takes an arbitrary object as first parameter and an optional filename as second parameter (default filename is qutip_data.qu). The filename extension is always .qu. The function qutip.fileio.qload takes a mandatory filename as first argument and loads and returns the objects in the file.; To illustrate how these functions can be used, consider a simple calculation of the steadystate of the harmonic oscillator:; In [2]: a = destroy(10); H = a.dag() * a ; c_ops = [sqrt(0.5) * a, sqrt(0.25) * a.dag()]. In [3]: rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops). The steadystate density matrix rho_ss is an instance of qutip.Qobj. It can be stored to a file steadystate.qu using; In [4]: qsave(rho_ss, 'steadystate'). In [5]: ls *.qu; density_matrix_vs_time.qu steadystate.qu. and it can later be loaded again, and used in further calculations:; In [6]: rho_ss_loaded = qload('steadystate'); Loaded Qobj object:; Quantum object: dims = [[10], [10]], shape = [10, 10], type = oper, isHerm = True. In [7]: a = destroy(10). In [8]: expect(a.dag() * a, rho_ss_loaded); Out[8]: 0.9902248289345064. The nice thing about the qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions is that almost any object can be stored and load again later on. We can for example store a list of density matrices as returned by qutip.mesolve:; In [9]: a = destroy(10); H = a.dag() * a ; c_ops = [sqrt(0.5) * a, ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-saving.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-saving.html

The qutip.operators.sigmap operator acting on the spin state returns the zero vector. Why is this? To see what happened, let us use the qutip.operators.sigmaz operator:; In [52]: sigmaz(); Out[52]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = [2, 2], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 1. 0.]; [ 0. -1.]].

In [56]: sigmaz() * spin2; Out[56]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [-1.]]. The answer is now apparent. Since the QuTiP qutip.operators.sigmaz function uses the standard z-basis representation of the sigma-z spin operator, the spin state corresponds to the \(\left|\mathrm{up}\right>\) state of a two-level spin system while spin2 gives the \(\left|\mathrm{down}\right>\) state. Therefore, in our previous example sigmap() * spin, we raised the qubit state out of the truncated two-level Hilbert space resulting in the zero state.; While at first glance this convention might seem somewhat odd, it is in fact quite handy. For one, the spin operators remain in the conventional form. Second, when the spin system is in the \(\left|\mathrm{up}\right>\) state:; In [57]: sigmaz() * spin; Out[57]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 0.]]. the non-zero component is the zeroth-element of the underlying matrix (remember that python uses c-indexing, and matrices start with the zeroth element).

Qubit (two-level) systems¶; Having spent a fair amount of time on basis states that represent harmonic oscillator states, we now move on to qubit, or two-level quantum systems (for example a spin-1/2). To create a state vector corresponding to a qubit system, we use the same qutip.states.basis, or qutip.states.fock, function with only two levels:; In [45]: spin = basis(2, 0). Now at this point one may ask how this state is different than that of a harmonic oscillator in the vacuum state truncated to two energy levels?; In [46]: vac = basis(2, 0). At this stage, there is no difference. This should not be surprising as we called the exact same function twice. The difference between the two comes from the action of the spin operators qutip.operators.sigmax, qutip.operators.sigmay, qutip.operators.sigmaz, qutip.operators.sigmap, and qutip.operators.sigmam on these two-level states. For example, if vac corresponds to the vacuum state of a harmonic oscillator, then, as we have already seen, we can use the raising operator to get the \(\left|1\right>\) state:; In [47]: vac; Out[47]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 0.]]. In [48]: c = create(2). In [49]: c * vac; Out[49]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]]. For a spin system, the operator analogous to the raising operator is the sigma-plus operator qutip.operators.sigmap. Operating on the",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-states.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-states.html
https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-states.html:4461,Integrability,depend,dependence,4461,"]. The raising operator has in indeed raised the state vec from the vacuum to the \(\left| 1\right>\) state. Instead of using the dagger Qobj.dag() method to raise the state, we could have also used the built in qutip.operators.create function to make a raising operator:; In [8]: c = create(5). In [9]: c * vac; Out[9]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. which does the same thing. We can raise the vacuum state more than once by successively apply the raising operator:; In [10]: c * c * vac; Out[10]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 1.41421356]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. or just taking the square of the raising operator \(\left(\hat{a}^\dagger\right)^{2}\):; In [11]: c ** 2 * vac; Out[11]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 1.41421356]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. Applying the raising operator twice gives the expected \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) dependence. We can use the product of \(c * a\) to also apply the number operator to the state vector vac:; In [12]: c * a * vac; Out[12]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or on the \(\left| 1\right>\) state:; In [13]: c * a * (c * vac); Out[13]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or the \(\left| 2\right>\) state:; In [14]: c * a * (c**2 * vac); Out[14]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 2.82842712]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. Notice how in this last example, application of the number operator does not give the expected value \(n=2\), but rather \(2\sqrt{2}\). This is because this last state is not normalized to unity as \(c\left| n\right> = \sqrt{n+1}\left| n+1\right>\). Therefore, we should normalize our vector first:; In [15]: c * a * (c**2 ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-states.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-states.html

Density matrices¶; One of the main purpose of QuTiP is to explore the dynamics of open quantum systems, where the most general state of a system is not longer a state vector, but rather a density matrix. Since operations on density matrices operate identically to those of vectors, we will just briefly highlight creating and using these structures.; The simplest density matrix is created by forming the outer-product \(\left|\psi\right>\left<\psi\right|\) of a ket vector:; In [29]: ket = basis(5, 2).

This fill-in can be reduced by using bandwidth minimization algorithms such as those discussed in Additional Solver Arguments. Additional parameters may be used by calling the steady-state solver as:; >>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method='power', use_rcm=True). where method='power' indicates that we are using the inverse-power solution method, and use_rcm=True turns on the bandwidth minimization routine.; Although it is not obvious, the 'direct', eigen, and 'power' methods all use an LU decomposition internally and thus suffer from a large memory overhead. In contrast, iterative methods such as the 'GMRES' and 'LGMRES' methods do not factor the matrix and thus take less memory than these previous methods and allowing, in principle, for extremely large system sizes. The downside is that these methods can take much longer than the direct method as the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is large, indicating that these iterative methods require a large number of iterations for convergence. To overcome this, one can use a preconditioner \(M\) that solves for an approximate inverse for the (modified) Liouvillian, thus better conditioning the problem, leading to faster convergence. The use of a preconditioner can actually make thee iterative methods faster than the other solution methods. The problem with precondioning is that it is only well defined for symmetric (or Hermitian), positive-definite matrices.

Partial trace¶; The partial trace is an operation that reduces the dimension of a Hilbert space by eliminating some degrees of freedom by averaging (tracing). In this sense it is therefore the converse of the tensor product. It is useful when one is interested in only a part of a coupled quantum system. For open quantum systems, this typically involves tracing over the environment leaving only the system of interest. In QuTiP the class method qutip.Qobj.ptrace is used to take partial traces. qutip.Qobj.ptrace acts on the qutip.Qobj instance for which it is called, and it takes one argument sel, which is a list of integers that mark the component systems that should be kept. All other components are traced out.; For example, the density matrix describing a single qubit obtained from a coupled two-qubit system is obtained via:; In [11]: psi = tensor(basis(2, 0), basis(2, 1)).

Note that the partial trace always results in a density matrix (mixed state), regardless of whether the composite system is a pure state (described by a state vector) or a mixed state (described by a density matrix):; In [14]: psi = tensor((basis(2, 0) + basis(2, 1)).unit(), basis(2, 0)).

Denoting the energy splitting of the atom and cavity omega_a and omega_c, respectively, and the atom-cavity interaction strength g, the Jaynes-Cumming Hamiltonian can be constructed as:; >>> N = 10; >>> omega_a = 1.0; >>> omega_c = 1.25; >>> g = 0.05; >>> a = tensor(identity(2), destroy(N)); >>> sm = tensor(destroy(2), identity(N)); >>> sz = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(N)); >>> H = 0.5 * omega_a * sz + omega_c * a.dag() * a + g * (a.dag() * sm + a * sm.dag()). Here N is the number of Fock states included in the cavity mode. Partial trace¶; The partial trace is an operation that reduces the dimension of a Hilbert space by eliminating some degrees of freedom by averaging (tracing). In this sense it is therefore the converse of the tensor product. It is useful when one is interested in only a part of a coupled quantum system.

In [76]: fig, ax = hinton(rho_ss) #, xlabels=xlabels, ylabels=xlabels). In [77]: plt.show(). Quantum process tomography¶; Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a useful technique for characterizing experimental implementations of quantum gates involving a small number of qubits. It can also be a useful theoretical tool that can give insight in how a process transforms states, and it can be used for example to study how noise or other imperfections deteriorate a gate. Whereas a fidelity or distance measure can give a single number that indicates how far from ideal a gate is, a quantum process tomography analysis can give detailed information about exactly what kind of errors various imperfections introduce.; The idea is to construct a transformation matrix for a quantum process (for example a quantum gate) that describes how the density matrix of a system is transformed by the process. We can then decompose the transformation in some operator basis that represent well-defined and easily interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix). Given an orthogonal operator basis of our choice \(\{B_i\}_i^{N^2}\), which satisfies \({\rm Tr}[B_i^\dagger B_j] = N\delta_{ij}\), we can write the ma",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-visualization.html

Visualization of quantum states and processes¶; Visualization is often an important complement to a simulation of a quantum; mechanical system. The first method of visualization that come to mind might be; to plot the expectation values of a few selected operators. But on top of that,; it can often be instructive to visualize for example the state vectors or; density matices that describe the state of the system, or how the state is; transformed as a function of time (see process tomography below). In this; section we demonstrate how QuTiP and matplotlib can be used to perform a few; types of visualizations that often can provide additional understanding of; quantum system. Fock-basis probability distribution¶; In quantum mechanics probability distributions plays an important role, and as; in statistics, the expectation values computed from a probability distribution; does not reveal the full story. For example, consider an quantum harmonic; oscillator mode with Hamiltonian \(H = \hbar\omega a^\dagger a\), which is; in a state described by its density matrix \(\rho\), and which on average; is occupied by two photons, \(\mathrm{Tr}[\rho a^\dagger a] = 2\). Given; this information we cannot say whether the oscillator is in a Fock state,; a thermal state, a coherent state, etc. By visualizing the photon distribution; in the Fock state basis important clues about the underlying state can be; obtained.; One convenient way to visualize a probability distribution is to use histograms.; Consider the following histogram visualization of the number-basis probability; distribut",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-visualization.html
https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-visualization.html:13463,Security,access,access,13463,"interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix). Given an orthogonal operator basis of our choice \(\{B_i\}_i^{N^2}\), which satisfies \({\rm Tr}[B_i^\dagger B_j] = N\delta_{ij}\), we can write the map as. (2)\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger.\]; where \(\chi_{mn} = \sum_{ij} b_{im}b_{jn}^*\) and \(A_i = \sum_{m} b_{im}B_{m}\). Here, matrix \(\chi\) is the transformation matrix we are after, since it describes how much \(B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger\) contributes to \(\rho_{\rm out}\).; In a numerical simulation of a quantum process we usually do not have access to the quantum map in the form Eq. (1). Instead, what we usually can do is to calculate the propagator \(U\) for the density matrix in superoperator form, using for example the QuTiP function qutip.propagator.propagator. We can then write. \[\epsilon(\tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}) = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = \tilde{\rho}_{\rm out}\]; where \(\tilde{\rho}\) is the vector representation of the density matrix \(\rho\). If we write Eq. (2) in superoperator form as well we obtain. \[\tilde{\rho}_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}.\]; so we can identify. \[U = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger.\]; Now this is a linear equation systems for the \(N^2 \times N^2\) elements in \(\chi\). We can solve it by writing \(\chi\) and the superoperator propagator as \([N^4]\) vectors, and likewise write the superoperator product \(\tilde{B}_m\tilde{B}_n^\dagger\) as a \([N^4\times N^4]\) matrix \(",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-visualization.html

This assumption is known as the Born approximation, and it implies that there never is any entanglement between the system and the bath, neither in the initial state nor at any time during the evolution. It is justified for weak system-bath interaction.; The master equation (1) is non-Markovian, i.e., the change in the density matrix at a time \(t\) depends on states at all times \(\tau < t\), making it intractable to solve both theoretically and numerically. To make progress towards a manageable master equation, we now introduce the Markovian approximation, in which \(\rho(s)\) is replaced by \(\rho(t)\) in Eq. (1). The result is the Redfield equation. (2)\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^t d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]],\]; which is local in time with respect the density matrix, but still not Markovian since it contains an implicit dependence on the initial state. By extending the integration to infinity and substituting \(\tau \rightarrow t-\tau\), a fully Markovian master equation is obtained:. (3)\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^\infty d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(t-\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]].\]; The two Markovian approximations introduced above are valid if the time-scale with which the system dynamics changes is large compared to the time-scale with which correlations in the bath decays (corresponding to a “short-memory” bath, which results in Markovian system dynamics).; The master equation (3) is still on a too general form to be suitable for numerical implementation. We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\t",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

It takes five mandatory arguments: the Bloch-Redfield tensor R, the list of eigenkets ekets, the initial state psi0 (as a ket or density matrix), a list of times tlist for which to evaluate the expectation values, and a list of operators e_ops for which to evaluate the expectation values at each time step defined by tlist. For example, to evaluate the expectation values of the \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) operators for the example above, we can use the following code:; >>> tlist = linspace(0, 15.0, 1000); >>> psi0 = rand_ket(2); >>> e_ops = [sigmax(), sigmay(), sigmaz()]; >>> expt_list = bloch_redfield_solve(R, ekets, psi0, tlist, e_ops); >>>; >>> sphere = Bloch(); >>> sphere.add_points([expt_list[0], expt_list[1], expt_list[2]]); >>> sphere.vector_color = ['r']; >>> # Hamiltonian axis; >>> sphere.add_vectors(array([delta, 0, eps0]) / sqrt(delta ** 2 + eps0 ** 2)); >>> sphere.make_sphere(); >>> show().

This object is a qutip.solver.Result class that stores all the crucial data needed for analyzing and plotting the results of a simulation. Like the qutip.Qobj class, the Result class has a collection of properties for storing information.

To access the data for the two expectation values one can do:; >>> expt0 = result.expect[0]; >>> expt1 = result.expect[1]. Recall that Python uses C-style indexing that begins with zero (i.e., [0] => 1st collapse operator data). Together with the array of times at which these expectation values are calculated:; >>> times = result.times. we can plot the resulting expectation values:; >>> plot(times, expt0, times, expt1); >>> show(). Data for expectation values extracted from the result Result object. State vectors, or density matrices, as well as col_times and col_which, are accessed in a similar manner, although typically one does not need an index (i.e [0]) since there is only one list for each of these components. The one exception to this rule is if you choose to output state vectors from the Monte Carlo solver, in which case there are ntraj number of state vector arrays. Saving and Loading Result Objects¶; The main advantage in using the Result class as a data storage object comes from the simplicity in which simulation data can be stored and later retrieved. The qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions are designed for this task. To begin, let us save the data object from the previous section into a file called “cavity+qubit-data” in the current working directory by calling:; >>> qsave(result, 'cavity+qubit-data'). All of the data results are then stored in a single file of the same name with a ”.qu” extension. Therefore, everything needed to later this data is stored in a single file. Loading the file is just as easy as saving:; >>> stored_result = qload('cavity+qubit-data'); Loaded Result object:; Result object with mcsolve data.; ---------------------------------; expect = True; num_expect = 2, num_collapse = 2, ntraj = 500. where stored_result is the new name of the Result object.

Introduction¶; Many time-dependent problems of interest are periodic. The dynamics of such systems can be solved for directly by numerical integration of the Schrödinger or Master equation, using the time-dependent Hamiltonian.

The Floquet-Markov Master equation is one such a formalism, with important applications for strongly driven systems (see e.g., [Gri98]).; Here we give an overview of how the Floquet and Floquet-Markov formalisms can be used for solving time-dependent problems in QuTiP.

Pre-computing the Floquet modes for one period¶; When evaluating the Floquet states or the wavefunction at many points in time it is useful to pre-compute the Floquet modes for the first period of the driving with the required resolution. In QuTiP the function qutip.floquet.floquet_modes_table calculates a table of Floquet modes which later can be used together with the function qutip.floquet.floquet_modes_t_lookup to efficiently lookup the Floquet mode at an arbitrary time.

Note; Currently the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve can only accept a single environment coupling operator and spectral-density function.

The other parameters are similar to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the same format for the return value is used qutip.solver.Result.

(3)\[ \Psi(t) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \Psi_\alpha(t) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; where the coefficients \(c_\alpha\) are determined by the initial wavefunction \(\Psi(0) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \Psi_\alpha(0)\).; This formalism is useful for finding \(\Psi(t)\) for a given \(H(t)\) only if we can obtain the Floquet modes \(\Phi_a(t)\) and quasienergies \(\epsilon_\alpha\) more easily than directly solving (1). By substituting (2) into the Schrödinger equation (1) we obtain an eigenvalue equation for the Floquet modes and quasienergies. (4)\[ \mathcal{H}(t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \epsilon_\alpha\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; where \(\mathcal{H}(t) = H(t) - i\hbar\partial_t\). This eigenvalue problem could be solved analytically or numerically, but in QuTiP we use an alternative approach for numerically finding the Floquet states and quasienergies [see e.g. Creffield et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 165301 (2003)]. Consider the propagator for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (1), which by definition satisfies. \[U(T+t,t)\Psi(t) = \Psi(T+t).\]; Inserting the Floquet states from (2) into this expression results in. \[U(T+t,t)\exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha(T+t)/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(T+t),\]; or, since \(\Phi_\alpha(T+t)=\Phi_\alpha(t)\),. \[U(T+t,t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha T/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \eta_\alpha \Phi_\alpha(t),\]; which shows that the Floquet modes are eigenstates of the one-period propagator. We can therefore find the Floquet modes and quasienergies \(\epsilon_\alpha = -\hbar\arg(\eta_\alpha)/T\) by numerically calculating \(U(T+t,t)\) and diagonalizing it. In particular this method is useful to find \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) by calculating and diagonalize \(U(T,0)\).; The Floquet modes at arbitrary time \(t\) can then be found by propagating \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) to \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) using the wave function propagator \(U(t,0)\Psi_\alpha(0) = \Psi_\alpha(t)\), which for the Floquet mod",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html

In particular this method is useful to find \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) by calculating and diagonalize \(U(T,0)\).; The Floquet modes at arbitrary time \(t\) can then be found by propagating \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) to \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) using the wave function propagator \(U(t,0)\Psi_\alpha(0) = \Psi_\alpha(t)\), which for the Floquet modes yields. \[U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; so that \(\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar) U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0)\). Since \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) is periodic we only need to evaluate it for \(t \in [0, T]\), and from \(\Phi_\alpha(t \in [0,T])\) we can directly evaluate \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\), \(\Psi_\alpha(t)\) and \(\Psi(t)\) for arbitrary large \(t\). Floquet formalism in QuTiP¶; QuTiP provides a family of functions to calculate the Floquet modes and quasi energies, Floquet state decomposition, etc., given a time-dependent Hamiltonian on the callback format, list-string format and list-callback format (see, e.g., qutip.mesolve for details).; Consider for example the case of a strongly driven two-level atom, described by the Hamiltonian. (5)\[ H(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\Delta\sigma_x - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\sigma_z + \frac{1}{2}A\sin(\omega t)\sigma_z.\]; In QuTiP we can define this Hamiltonian as follows; >>> delta = 0.2 * 2*pi; eps0 = 1.0 * 2*pi; A = 2.5 * 2*pi; omega = 1.0 * 2*pi; >>> H0 = - delta/2.0 * sigmax() - eps0/2.0 * sigmaz(); >>> H1 = A/2.0 * sigmaz(); >>> args = {'w': omega}; >>> H = [H0, [H1, 'sin(w * t)']]. The \(t=0\) Floquet modes corresponding to the Hamiltonian (5) can then be calculated using the qutip.floquet.floquet_modes function, which returns lists containing the Floquet modes and the quasienergies; >>> T = 2*pi / omega; >>> f_modes, f_energies = floquet_modes(H, T, args); >>> f_energies; array([ 2.83131211, -2.83131211]); >>> f_modes0; [Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.3",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html

This matrix equation can, in principle, be solved by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix \(H\). In practice, however, it is difficult to perform this diagonalization unless the size of the Hilbert space (dimension of the matrix \(H\)) is small. Analytically, it is a formidable task to calculate the dynamics for systems with more than two states. If, in addition, we consider dissipation due to the inevitable interaction with a surrounding environment, the computational complexity grows even larger, and we have to resort to numerical calculations in all realistic situations. This illustrates the importance of numerical calculations in describing the dynamics of open quantum systems, and the need for efficient and accessible tools for this task.; The Schrödinger equation, which governs the time-evolution of closed quantum systems, is defined by its Hamiltonian and state vector. In the previous section, Using Tensor Products and Partial Traces, we showed how Hamiltonians and state vectors are constructed in QuTiP. Given a Hamiltonian, we can calculate the unitary (non-dissipative) time-evolution of an arbitrary state vector \(\left|\psi_0\right>\) (psi0) using the QuTiP function qutip.mesolve. It evolves the state vector and evaluates the expectation values for a set of operators expt_ops at the points in time in the list times, using an ordinary differential equation solver. Alternatively, we can use the function qutip.essolve, which uses the exponential-series technique to calculate the time evolution of a system. The qutip.mesolve and qutip.essolve functions take the same arguments and it is therefore easy switch between the two solvers.; ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html

Non-unitary evolution¶; While the evolution of the state vector in a closed quantum system is deterministic, open quantum systems are stochastic in nature. The effect of an environment on the system of interest is to induce stochastic transitions between energy levels, and to introduce uncertainty in the phase difference between states of the system. The state of an open quantum system is therefore described in terms of ensemble averaged states using the density matrix formalism. A density matrix \(\rho\) describes a probability distribution of quantum states \(\left|\psi_n\right>\), in a matrix representation \(\rho = \sum_n p_n \left|\psi_n\right>\left<\psi_n\right|\), where \(p_n\) is the classical probability that the system is in the quantum state \(\left|\psi_n\right>\). The time evolution of a density matrix \(\rho\) is the topic of the remaining portions of this section. The Lindblad Master equation¶; The standard approach for deriving the equations of motion for a system interacting with its environment is to expand the scope of the system to include the environment. The combined quantum system is then closed, and its evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation.

https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html:10022,Energy Efficiency,reduce,reduced,10022,"racting with its environment is to expand the scope of the system to include the environment. The combined quantum system is then closed, and its evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation. (2)\[\dot \rho_{\rm tot}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H_{\rm tot}, \rho_{\rm tot}(t)],\]; the equivalent of the Schrödinger equation (1) in the density matrix formalism. Here, the total Hamiltonian. \[H_{\rm tot} = H_{\rm sys} + H_{\rm env} + H_{\rm int},\]; includes the original system Hamiltonian \(H_{\rm sys}\), the Hamiltonian for the environment \(H_{\rm env}\), and a term representing the interaction between the system and its environment \(H_{\rm int}\). Since we are only interested in the dynamics of the system, we can at this point perform a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom in Eq. (2), and thereby obtain a master equation for the motion of the original system density matrix. The most general trace-preserving and completely positive form of this evolution is the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix \(\rho = {\rm Tr}_{\rm env}[\rho_{\rm tot}]\). (3)\[\dot\rho(t)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[H(t),\rho(t)]+\sum_n \frac{1}{2} \left[2 C_n \rho(t) C_n^{+} - \rho(t) C_n^{+} C_n - C_n^{+} C_n \rho(t)\right]\]; where the \(C_n = \sqrt{\gamma_n} A_n\) are collapse operators, and \(A_n\) are the operators through which the environment couples to the system in \(H_{\rm int}\), and \(\gamma_n\) are the corresponding rates. The derivation of Eq. (3) may be found in several sources, and will not be reproduced here. Instead, we emphasize the approximations that are required to arrive at the master equation in the form of Eq. (3) from physical arguments, and hence perform a calculation in QuTiP:. Separability: At \(t=0\) there are no correlations between the system and its environment such that the total density matrix can be written as a tensor product \(\rho^I_{\rm tot}(0) = \rho^I(0) \otimes \rho^I_{\rm env}(0)\).; Born approximation: Requires: (1) that the",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html

These assumptions are justified if the interaction is weak, and if the environment is much larger than the system. In summary, \(\rho_{\rm tot}(t) \approx \rho(t)\otimes\rho_{\rm env}\).; Markov approximation The time-scale of decay for the environment \(\tau_{\rm env}\) is much shorter than the smallest time-scale of the system dynamics \(\tau_{\rm sys} \gg \tau_{\rm env}\). This approximation is often deemed a “short-memory environment” as it requires that environmental correlation functions decay on a time-scale fast compared to those of the system.; Secular approximation Stipulates that elements in the master equation corresponding to transition frequencies satisfy \(|\omega_{ab}-\omega_{cd}| \ll 1/\tau_{\rm sys}\), i.e., all fast rotating terms in the interaction picture can be neglected. It also ignores terms that lead to a small renormalization of the system energy levels. This approximation is not strictly necessary for all master-equation formalisms (e.g., the Block-Redfield master equation), but it is required for arriving at the Lindblad form (3) which is used in qutip.mesolve. For systems with environments satisfying the conditions outlined above, the Lindblad master equation (3) governs the time-evolution of the system density matrix, giving an ensemble average of the system dynamics.

Unitary evolution¶; The dynamics of a closed (pure) quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation. (1)\[ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = \hat H \Psi,\]; where \(\Psi\) is the wave function, \(\hat H\) the Hamiltonian, and \(\hbar\) is Planck’s constant. In general, the Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) where both \(\Psi\) and \(\hat H\) are functions of space and time. For computational purposes it is useful to expand the PDE in a set of basis functions that span the Hilbert space of the Hamiltonian, and to write the equation in matrix and vector form. \[\begin{split}i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}\left|\psi\right> = H \left|\psi\right>\end{split}\]; where \(\left|\psi\right>\) is the state vector and \(H\) is the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian. This matrix equation can, in principle, be solved by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix \(H\). In practice, however, it is difficult to perform this diagonalization unless the size of the Hilbert space (dimension of the matrix \(H\)) is small.

The time evolution of a density matrix \(\rho\) is the topic of the remaining portions of this section. The Lindblad Master equation¶; The standard approach for deriving the equations of motion for a system interacting with its environment is to expand the scope of the system to include the environment. The combined quantum system is then closed, and its evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation. (2)\[\dot \rho_{\rm tot}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H_{\rm tot}, \rho_{\rm tot}(t)],\]; the equivalent of the Schrödinger equation (1) in the density matrix formalism. Here, the total Hamiltonian. \[H_{\rm tot} = H_{\rm sys} + H_{\rm env} + H_{\rm int},\]; includes the original system Hamiltonian \(H_{\rm sys}\), the Hamiltonian for the environment \(H_{\rm env}\), and a term representing the interaction between the system and its environment \(H_{\rm int}\). Since we are only interested in the dynamics of the system, we can at this point perform a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom in Eq. (2), and thereby obtain a master equation for the motion of the original system density matrix. The most general trace-preserving and completely positive form of this evolution is the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix \(\rho = {\rm Tr}_{\rm env}[\rho_{\rm tot}]\). (3)\[\dot\rho(t)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[H(t),\rho(t)]+\sum_n \frac{1}{2} \left[2 C_n \rho(t) C_n^{+} - \rho(t) C_n^{+} C_n - C_n^{+} C_n \rho(t)\right]\]; where the \(C_n = \sqrt{\gamma_n} A_n\) are collapse operators, and \(A_n\) are the operators through which the environment couples to the system in \(H_{\rm int}\), and \(\gamma_n\) are the corresponding rates. The derivation of Eq. (3) may be found in several sources, and will not be reproduced here.

Instead, we emphasize the approximations that are required to arrive at the master equation in the form of Eq. (3) from physical arguments, and hence perform a calculation in QuTiP:. Separability: At \(t=0\) there are no correlations between the system and its environment such that the total density matrix can be written as a tensor product \(\rho^I_{\rm tot}(0) = \rho^I(0) \otimes \rho^I_{\rm env}(0)\).; Born approximation: Requires: (1) that the state of the environment does not significantly change as a result of the interaction with the system; (2) The system and the environment remain separable throughout the evolution. These assumptions are justified if the interaction is weak, and if the environment is much larger than the system. In summary, \(\rho_{\rm tot}(t) \approx \rho(t)\otimes\rho_{\rm env}\).; Markov approximation The time-scale of decay for the environment \(\tau_{\rm env}\) is much shorter than the smallest time-scale of the system dynamics \(\tau_{\rm sys} \gg \tau_{\rm env}\).

If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run. However, like many other options in QuTiP you are free to change the number of trajectories to fit your needs. If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; >>> data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm],; >>> ntraj=1000). where we have added the keyword argument ntraj=1000 at the end of the inputs. Now, the Monte Carlo solver will calculate expectation values for both operators, a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm averaging over 1000 trajectories. Sometimes one is also interested in seeing how the Monte Carlo trajectories converge to the master equation solution by calculating expectation values over a range of trajectory numbers. If, for example, we want to average over 1, 10, 100, and 1000 trajectories, then we can input this into the solver using:; >>> ntraj = [1, 10, 100, 1000].

If, for example, we want to average over 1, 10, 100, and 1000 trajectories, then we can input this into the solver using:; >>> ntraj = [1, 10, 100, 1000]. Keep in mind that the input list must be in ascending order since the total number of trajectories run by mcsolve will be calculated using the last element of ntraj. In this case, we need to use an extra index when getting the expectation values from the qutip.solver.Result object returned by mcsolve. In the above example using:; >>> data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm],; >>> ntraj=[1, 10, 100, 1000]). we can extract the relevant expectation values using:; expt1 = data.expect[0] # <- expectation values for 1 trajectory; expt10 = data.expect[1] # <- expectation values avg. over 10 trajectories; expt100 = data.expect[2] # <- expectation values avg. over 100 trajectories; expt1000 = data.expect[3] # <- expectation values avg. over 1000 trajectories.

Introduction¶; Where as the density matrix formalism describes the ensemble average over many identical realizations of a quantum system, the Monte Carlo (MC), or quantum-jump approach to wave function evolution, allows for simulating an individual realization of the system dynamics. Here, the environment is continuously monitored, resulting in a series of quantum jumps in the system wave function, conditioned on the increase in information gained about the state of the system via the environmental measurements. In general, this evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. (1)\[H_{\rm eff}=H_{\rm sys}-\frac{i\hbar}{2}\sum_{i}C^{+}_{n}C_{n},\]; where again, the \(C_{n}\) are collapse operators, each corresponding to a separate irreversible process with rate \(\gamma_{n}\). Here, the strictly negative non-Hermitian portion of Eq. (1) gives rise to a reduction in the norm of the wave function, that to first-order in a small time \(\delta t\), is given by \(\left<\psi(t+\delta t)|\psi(t+\delta t)\right>=1-\delta p\) where.

The Monte Carlo solver also has many available options that can be set using the qutip.solver.Options class as discussed in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Reusing Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. In order to solve a given simulation as fast as possible, the solvers in QuTiP take the given input operators and break them down into simpler components before passing them on to the ODE solvers. Although these operations are reasonably fast, the time spent organizing data can become appreciable when repeatedly solving a system over, for example, many different initial conditions. In cases such as this, the Hamiltonian and other operators may be reused after the initial configuration, thus speeding up calculations. Note that, unless you are planning to reuse the data many times, this functionality will not be very useful.; To turn on the “reuse” functionality we must set the rhs_reuse=True flag in the qutip.solver.Options:; >>> options = Options(rhs_reuse=True). A full account of this feature is given in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Using the previous example, we will calculate the dynamics for two different initial states, with the Hamiltonian data being reused on the second call:; from qutip import *; from pylab import *. times = linspace(0.0, 10.0, 200); psi0 = tensor(fock(2, 0), fock(10, 5)); a = tensor(qeye(2), destroy(10)); sm = tensor(destroy(2), qeye(10)); H = 2 * pi * a.dag() * a + 2 * pi * sm.dag() * sm + \; 2 * pi * 0.25 * (sm * a.dag() + sm.dag() * a). # first run; data1 = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm]). # change initial state; psi1 = tensor(fock(2, 0), coherent(10",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html

Monte Carlo Solver¶. Introduction¶; Where as the density matrix formalism describes the ensemble average over many identical realizations of a quantum system, the Monte Carlo (MC), or quantum-jump approach to wave function evolution, allows for simulating an individual realization of the system dynamics. Here, the environment is continuously monitored, resulting in a series of quantum jumps in the system wave function, conditioned on the increase in information gained about the state of the system via the environmental measurements. In general, this evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. (1)\[H_{\rm eff}=H_{\rm sys}-\frac{i\hbar}{2}\sum_{i}C^{+}_{n}C_{n},\]; where again, the \(C_{n}\) are collapse operators, each corresponding to a separate irreversible process with rate \(\gamma_{n}\). Here, the strictly negative non-Hermitian portion of Eq. (1) gives rise to a reduction in the norm of the wave function, that to first-order in a small time \(\delta t\), is given by \(\left<\psi(t+\delta t)|\psi(t+\delta t)\right>=1-\delta p\) where. (2)\[\begin{split}\delta p =\delta t \sum_{n}\left<\psi(t)|C^{+}_{n}C_{n}|\psi(t)\right>,\end{split}\]; and \(\delta t\) is such that \(\delta p \ll 1\). With a probability of remaining in the state \(\left|\psi(t+\delta t)\right>\) given by \(1-\delta p\), the corresponding quantum jump probability is thus Eq. (2).",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html

The advantage of the Monte Carlo method over the master equation approach is that only the state vector is required to be kept in the computers memory, as opposed to the entire density matrix. For large quantum system this becomes a significant advantage, and the Monte Carlo solver is therefore generally recommended for such systems. For example, simulating a Heisenberg spin-chain consisting of 10 spins with random parameters and initial states takes almost 7 times longer using the master equation rather than Monte Carlo approach with the default number of trajectories running on a quad-CPU machine. Furthermore, it takes about 7 times the memory as well. However, for small systems, the added overhead of averaging a large number of stochastic trajectories to obtain the open system dynamics, as well as starting the multiprocessing functionality, outweighs the benefit of the minor (in this case) memory saving. Master equation methods are therefore generally more efficient when Hilbert space sizes are on the order of a couple of hundred states or smaller.; Like the master equation solver qutip.mesolve, the Monte Carlo solver returns a qutip.solver.Result object consisting of expectation values, if the user has defined expectation value operators in the 5th argument to mcsolve, or state vectors if no expectation value operators are given. If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories.

Monte Carlo in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, Monte Carlo evolution is implemented with the qutip.mcsolve function. It takes nearly the same arguments as the qutip.mesolve; function for master-equation evolution, except that the initial state must be a ket vector, as oppose to a density matrix, and there is an optional keyword parameter ntraj that defines the number of stochastic trajectories to be simulated. By default, ntraj=500 indicating that 500 Monte Carlo trajectories will be performed.; To illustrate the use of the Monte Carlo evolution of quantum systems in QuTiP, let’s again consider the case of a two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity.

Note; In order to use the Fortran Monte Carlo solver, you must have the blas development libraries, and installed QuTiP using the flag: --with-f90mc. In performing time-independent Monte Carlo simulations with QuTiP, systems with small Hilbert spaces suffer from poor performance as the ODE solver must exit the ODE solver at each time step and check for the state vector norm. To correct this, QuTiP now includes an optional Fortran based Monte Carlo solver that has markedly enhanced performance for smaller systems. Using the Fortran based solver is extremely simple; one just needs to replace mcsolve with mcsolve_f90. For example, from our previous demonstation:; data1 = mcsolve_f90(H, psi0, times, [sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm]).

If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run. However, like many other options in QuTiP you are free to change the number of trajectories to fit your needs. If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; >>> data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm],; >>> ntraj=1000). where we have added the keyword argument ntraj=1000 at the end of the inputs. Now, the Monte Carlo solver will calculate expectation values for both operators, a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm averaging over 1000 trajectories. Sometimes one is also interested in seeing how the Monte Carlo trajectories converge to the master equation solution by calculating expectation values over a range of trajectory numbers. If, for example, we want to average over 1, 10, 100, and 1000 trajectories, then we can input this into the solver using:; >>> ntraj = [1, 10, 100, 1000]. Keep in mind that the input list must be in ascending order since the total number of trajectories run by mcsolve will be calculated using the last element of ntraj. In this case, we need to use an extra index when getting the expectation values from the qutip.solver.Result object returned by mcsolve.

In the above example using:; >>> data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm],; >>> ntraj=[1, 10, 100, 1000]). we can extract the relevant expectation values using:; expt1 = data.expect[0] # <- expectation values for 1 trajectory; expt10 = data.expect[1] # <- expectation values avg. over 10 trajectories; expt100 = data.expect[2] # <- expectation values avg. over 100 trajectories; expt1000 = data.expect[3] # <- expectation values avg. over 1000 trajectories. The Monte Carlo solver also has many available options that can be set using the qutip.solver.Options class as discussed in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Reusing Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. In order to solve a given simulation as fast as possible, the solvers in QuTiP take the given input operators and break them down into simpler components before passing them on to the ODE solvers. Although these operations are reasonably fast, the time spent organizing data can become appreciable when repeatedly solving a system over, for example, many different initial conditions. In cases such as this, the Hamiltonian and other operators may be reused after the initial configuration, thus speeding up calculations. Note that, unless you are planning to reuse the data many times, this functionality will not be very useful.; To turn on the “reuse” functionality we must set the rhs_reuse=True flag in the qutip.solver.Options:; >>> options = Options(rhs_reuse=True). A full account of this feature is given in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Using the previous example, we will calculate the dynamics for two different initial states, with the Hamiltonian data being reused on the second call:; from qutip import *; from pylab import *. times = linspace(0.0, 10.0, 200); psi0 = ten",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html

Function based: Hamiltonian / collapse operators expressed using [qobj, func] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients of the Hamiltonian (or collapse operators) are expressed in the Python functions.; String (Cython) based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, string] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings. The resulting Hamiltonian is then compiled into C code using Cython and executed.; Hamiltonian function (outdated): The Hamiltonian is itself a Python function with time-dependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. If you can write you time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) then you may use this method:; 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil',; 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1',; 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma',; 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p',; 'modf', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc'.

Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page. Function Based Time Dependence¶; A very general way to write a time-dependent Hamiltonian or collapse operator is by using Python functions as the time-dependent coefficients. To accomplish this, we need to write a Python function that returns the time-dependent coefficient. Additionally, we need to tell QuTiP that a given Hamiltonian or collapse operator should be associated with a given Python function. To do this, one needs to specify operator-function pairs in list format: [Op, py_coeff], where Op is a given Hamiltonian or collapse operator and py_coeff is the name of the Python function ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

Calling the solvers is the same as before:; >>> output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). We can also use the args variable in the same manner as before, however we must rewrite our string term to read: 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)':; H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]; args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}; output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args). Important; Naming your args variables e or pi will mess things up when using the string-based format. Collapse operators are handled in the exact same way. Function Based Hamiltonian¶; In the previous version of QuTiP, the simulation of time-dependent problems required writing the Hamiltonian itself as a Python function. However, this method does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators, and is therefore more restrictive. Furthermore, it is less efficient than the other methods for all but the most basic of Hamiltonians (see the next section for a comparison of times.). In this format, the entire Hamiltonian is written as a Python function:; def Hfunc(t, args):; H0 = args[0]; H1 = args[1]; w = 9 * exp(-(t/5.)**2); return H0 - w * H1. where the args variable must always be given, and is now a list of Hamiltonian terms: args=[H0, H1]. In this format, our call to the master equation is now:; >>> output = mesolve(Hfunc, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args=[H0, H1]). We cannot evaluate time-dependent collapse operators in this format, so we can not simulate the previous harmonic oscillator decay example. A Quick Comparison of Simulation Times¶; Here we give a table of simulation times for the single-photon example using the different time-dependent formats and both the master equation and Monte Carlo solver.

Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. If you can write you time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) then you may use this method:; 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil',; 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1',; 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma',; 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p',; 'modf', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc'. Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page.

In this case, the second call to qutip.mcsolve takes 3 seconds less than the first. Of course our parameters are different, but this also shows how much time one can save by not reorganizing the data, and in the case of the string format, not recompiling the code. If you need to call the solvers many times for different parameters, this savings will obviously start to add",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. If you can write you time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) then you may use this method:; 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil',; 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1',; 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma',; 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p',; 'modf', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc'. Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page. Function Based Time Dependence¶; A very general way to write a time-dependent Hamiltonian or collapse operator is by using Python functions as th",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

See Installation for instructions on installing Cython. The string-based time-dependent format works in a similar manner as the previously discussed Python function method. That being said, the underlying code does something completely different. When using this format, the strings used to represent the time-dependent coefficients, as well as Hamiltonian and collapse operators, are rewritten as Cython code using a code generator class and then compiled into C code. The details of this meta-programming will be published in due course. however, in short, this can lead to a substantial reduction in time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals. We remind the reader that the types of functions that can be used with this method is limited to:; ['acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil'; , 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1'; , 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma'; , 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p'; , 'modf', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc']. Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient. For our first example, this string would be '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)'. The Hamiltonian in this format would take the form:; >>> H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)']]. Notice that this is a valid Hamiltonian for the string-based format as exp is included in the above list of suitable functions. Calling the solvers is the same as before:; >>> output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). We can also use the args variable in the same manner as before, however we must rewrite our string term to read: 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)':; H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]; args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}; o",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

Given that we have a single time-dependent Hamiltonian term, and constant collapse terms, we need to specify a single Python function for the coefficient \(f(t)\). In this case, one can simply do:; def H1_coeff(t, args):; return 9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2). In this case, the return value dependents only on time. However, when specifying Python functions for coefficients, the function must have (t,args) as the input variables, in that order.

Softw.; 38, no. 2, (2011). weighted_bipartite_matching(A, perm_type='row')[source]¶; Returns an array of row permutations that attempts to maximize; the product of the ABS values of the diagonal elements in; a nonsingular square CSC sparse matrix. Such a permutation is; always possible provided that the matrix is nonsingular.; This function looks at both the structure and ABS values of the; underlying matrix. Parameters:A : csc_matrix. Input matrix. perm_type : str {‘row’, ‘column’}. Type of permutation to generate. Returns:perm : array. Array of row or column permutations. Notes; This function uses a weighted maximum cardinality bipartite matching; algorithm based on breadth-first search (BFS). The columns are weighted; according to the element of max ABS value in the associated rows and; are traversed in descending order by weight. When performing the BFS; traversal, the row associated to a given column is the one with maximum; weight. Unlike other techniques[R4]_, this algorithm does not guarantee the; product of the diagonal is maximized. However, this limitation is offset; by the substantially faster runtime of this method.; References. [R4]. Duff and J.

We can create a Qobj with a user defined data set by passing a list or array of data into the Qobj:; In [4]: Qobj([[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]); Out[4]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 2.]; [ 3.]; [ 4.]; [ 5.]]. In [5]: x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]). In [6]: Qobj(x); Out[6]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[1], [5]], shape = [1, 5], type = bra; Qobj data =; [[ 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.]]. In [7]: r = np.random.rand(4, 4). In [8]: Qobj(r); Out[8]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[4], [4]], shape = [4, 4], type = oper, isherm = False; Qobj data =; [[ 0.13271688 0.96498406 0.6217972 0.05120659]; [ 0.95073525 0.4422577 0.93436513 0.39684026]; [ 0.14249098 0.57866168 0.75444556 0.95474959]; [ 0.43023463 0.67188093 0.42813227 0.53413365]]. Notice how both the dims and shape change according to the input data. Although dims and shape appear to have the same function, the difference will become quite clear in the section on tensor products and partial traces. Note; If you are running QuTiP from a python script you must use the print function to view the Qobj attributes. States and operators¶; Manually specifying the data for each quantum object is inefficient. Even more so when most objects correspond to commonly used types such as the ladder operators of a harmonic oscillator, the Pauli spin operators for a two-level system, or state vectors such as Fock states. Therefore, QuTiP includes predefined objects for a variety of states:. States; Command (# means optional); Inputs. Fock state ket vector; basis(N,#m)/fock(N,#m); N = number of levels in Hilbert space,; m = level containing excitation; (0 if no m given). Fock density matrix; (outer product of basis); fock_dm(N,#p); same as basis(N,m) / fock(N,m). Coherent state; coherent(N,alpha); alpha = complex number (eigenvalue); for requested coherent state. Coherent density matrix; (outer product); coherent_dm(N,alpha)",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-basics.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-basics.html

Notice how the color and point markers change for each set of data. Again, we have had to call add_points twice because adding more than one set of multiple data points is not supported by the add_points function.; What if we want to vary the color of our points. We can tell the qutip.Bloch class to vary the color of each point according to the colors listed in the b.point_color list (see Configuring the Bloch sphere below). Again after clear():; In [39]: xp = [np.cos(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [40]: yp = [sin(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [41]: zp = np.zeros(20). In [42]: pnts = [xp, yp, zp]. In [43]: b.add_points(pnts,'m') # <-- add a 'm' string to signify 'multi' colored points. In [44]: b.show(). Now, the data points cycle through a variety of predefined colors. Now lets add another set of points, but this time we want the set to be a single color, representing say a qubit going from the \(\left|\rm up\right>\) state to the \(\left|\rm down\right>\) state in the y-z plane:; In [45]: xz = np.zeros(20). In [46]: yz = [np.sin(th) for th in np.linspace(0, pi ,20)]. In [47]: zz = [np.cos(th) for th in np.linspace(0, pi, 20)]. In [48]: b.add_points([xz, yz, zz]) # no 'm'. In [49]: b.show(). Again, the same plot can be generated using the qutip.Bloch3d class by replacing Bloch with Bloch3d:. A more slick way of using this ‘multi’ color feature is also given in the example, where we set the color of the markers as a function of time. Differences Between Bloch and Bloch3d¶; While in general the Bloch and Bloch3d classes are interchangeable, there are some important differences to consider when choosing between them. The Bloch class uses Matplotlib to generate figures. As such, the data plotted on the sphere is in reality just a 2D object. In contrast the Bloch3d class uses the 3D rendering engine from VTK via mayavi to generate the sphere and the included data.

Animating with the Bloch sphere¶; The Bloch class was designed from the outset to generate animations. To animate a set of vectors or data points the basic idea is: plot the data at time t1, save the sphere, clear the sphere, plot data at t2,... The Bloch sphere will automatically number the output file based on how many times the object has been saved (this is stored in b.savenum). The easiest way to animate data on the Bloch sphere is to use the save() method and generate a series of images to convert into an animation. However, as of Matplotlib version 1.1, creating animations is built-in. We will demonstrate both methods by looking at the decay of a qubit on the bloch sphere. Example: Qubit Decay¶; The code for calculating the expectation values for the Pauli spin operators of a qubit decay is given below. This code is common to both animation examples.; from qutip import *; from scipy import *; def qubit_integrate(w, theta, gamma1, gamma2, psi0, tlist):; # operators and the hamiltonian; sx = sigmax(); sy = sigmay(); sz = sigmaz(); sm = sigmam(); H = w * (cos(theta) * sz + sin(theta) * sx); # collapse operators; c_op_list = []; n_th = 0.5 # temperatur",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-bloch.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-bloch.html

To evaluate the C-number qutip.eseries at the times times we use esval(es3_expect, times), or, equivalently, es3_expect.value(times). Applications of exponential series¶; The exponential series formalism can be useful for the time-evolution of quantum systems. One approach to calculating the time evolution of a quantum system is to diagonalize its Hamiltonian (or Liouvillian, for dissipative systems) and to express the propagator (e.g., \(\exp(-iHt) \rho \exp(iHt)\)) as an exponential series.; The QuTiP function qutip.essolve.ode2es and qutip.essolve use this method to evolve quantum systems in time. The exponential series approach is particularly suitable for cases when the same system is to be evolved for many different initial states, since the diagonalization only needs to be performed once (as opposed to e.g. the ode solver that would need to be ran independently for each initial state).; As an example, consider a spin-1/2 with a Hamiltonian pointing in the \(\sigma_z\) direction, and that is subject to noise causing relaxation. For a spin originally is in the up state, we can create an qutip.eseries object describing its dynamics by using the qutip.es2ode function:; In [14]: psi0 = basis(2,1). In [15]: H = sigmaz(). In [16]: L = liouvillian(H, [sqrt(1.0) * destroy(2)]). In [17]: es = ode2es(L, psi0). The qutip.essolve.ode2es function diagonalizes the Liouvillian \(L\) and creates an exponential series with the correct eigenfrequencies and amplitudes for the initial state \(\psi_0\) (psi0).; We can examine the resulting qutip.eseries object by pri",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-eseries.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-eseries.html

Applications of exponential series¶; The exponential series formalism can be useful for the time-evolution of quantum systems. One approach to calculating the time evolution of a quantum system is to diagonalize its Hamiltonian (or Liouvillian, for dissipative systems) and to express the propagator (e.g., \(\exp(-iHt) \rho \exp(iHt)\)) as an exponential series.; The QuTiP function qutip.essolve.ode2es and qutip.essolve use this method to evolve quantum systems in time. The exponential series approach is particularly suitable for cases when the same system is to be evolved for many different initial states, since the diagonalization only needs to be performed once (as opposed to e.g. the ode solver that would need to be ran independently for each initial state).; As an example, consider a spin-1/2 with a Hamiltonian pointing in the \(\sigma_z\) direction, and that is subject to noise causing relaxation. For a spin originally is in the up state, we can create an qutip.eseries object describing its dynamics by using the qutip.es2ode function:; In [14]: psi0 = basis(2,1). In [15]: H = sigmaz(). In [16]: L = liouvillian(H, [sqrt(1.0) * destroy(2)]). In [17]: es = ode2es(L, psi0). The qutip.essolve.ode2es function diagonalizes the Liouvillian \(L\) and creates an exponential series with the correct eigenfrequencies and amplitudes for the initial state \(\psi_0\) (psi0).; We can examine the resulting qutip.eseries object by printing a text representation:; In [18]: es; Out[18]: ; ESERIES object: 2 terms; Hilbert space dimensions: [[2], [2]]; Exponent #0 = (-1+0j",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-eseries.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-eseries.html

The coefficients are typically quantum objects (type Qobj: states, operators, etc.), so that the value of the eseries also is a quantum object, and the rates can be either real or complex numbers (describing decay rates and oscillation frequencies, respectively). Note that all amplitude coefficients in an exponential series must be of the same dimensions and composition.; In QuTiP, an exponential series object is constructed by creating an instance of the class qutip.eseries:; In [1]: es1 = eseries(sigmax(), 1j). where the first argument is the amplitude coefficient (here, the sigma-X operator), and the second argument is the rate. The eseries in this example represents the time-dependent operator \(\sigma_x e^{i t}\).; To add more terms to an qutip.eseries object we simply add objects using the + operator:; In [2]: omega=1.0. In [3]: es2 = (eseries(0.5 * sigmax(), 1j * omega) +; ...: eseries(0.5 * sigmax(), -1j * omega)); ...: . The qutip.eseries in this example represents the operator \(0.5 \sigma_x e^{i\omega t} + 0.5 \sigma_x e^{-i\omega t}\), which is the exponential series representation of \(\sigma_x \cos(\omega t)\). Alternatively, we can also specify a list of amplitudes and rates when the qutip.eseries is created:; In [4]: es2 = eseries([0.5 * sigmax(), 0.5 * sigmax()], [1j * omega, -1j * omega]). We can inspect the structure of an qutip.eseries object by printing it to the standard output console:; In [5]: es2; Out[5]: ; ESERIES object: 2 terms; Hilbert space dimensions: [[2], [2]]; Exponent #0 = -1j; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = [2, 2], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 0. 0.5]; [ 0.5 0. ]]; Exponent #1 = 1j; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = [2, 2], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 0. 0.5]; [ 0.5 0. ]]. and we c",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-eseries.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-eseries.html

To this end, QuTiP is built from a large (and ever growing) library of functions and classes; from qutip.states.basis to qutip.wigner. The general organization of QuTiP, highlighting the important API available to the user, is shown in the QuTiP tree-diagram of user accessible functions and classes.

You can change this number to a lower value, however setting it higher than the number of CPU’s will cause a drop in performance. In qutip.parallel.parallel_map, keyword arguments to the task function are specified using task_kwargs argument, so there is no special reserved keyword arguments.; The qutip.parallel.parallel_map function also supports progressbar, using the keyword argument progress_bar which can be set to True or to an instance of qutip.ui.progressbar.BaseProgressBar. There is a function called qutip.parallel.serial_map that works as a non-parallel drop-in replacement for qutip.parallel.parallel_map, which allows easy switching between serial and parallel computation.; In [23]: import time.

For example:; In [1]: def func1(x): return x, x**2, x**3. In [2]: a, b, c = parfor(func1, range(10)). In [3]: print(a); [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]. In [4]: print(b); [ 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81].

In [8]: print(result_array[:, 0]) # == a; [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]. In [9]: print(result_array[:, 1]) # == b; [ 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81]. In [10]: print(result_array[:, 2]) # == c; [ 0 1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729]. Note that the return values are arranged differently for the qutip.parallel.parallel_map and the qutip.parallel.parfor functions, as illustrated below. In particular, the return value of qutip.parallel.parallel_map is not enforced to be NumPy arrays, which can avoid unnecessary copying if all that is needed is to iterate over the resulting list:; In [11]: result = parfor(func1, range(5)). In [12]: print(result); [array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), array([ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16]), array([ 0, 1, 8, 27, 64])]. In [13]: result = parallel_map(func1, range(5)). In [14]: print(result); [(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (2, 4, 8), (3, 9, 27), (4, 16, 64)].

In this previous example, we see that the generated Hermitian operator contains a fraction of elements that are identically equal to zero. The number of nonzero elements is called the density and can be controlled by calling any of the random state/operator generators with a second argument between 0 and 1. By default, the density for the operators is 0.75 where as ket vectors are completely dense (1).

Warning; In the case of a density matrix, setting the density too low will result in not enough diagonal elements to satisfy \(Tr(\rho)=1\). Composite random objects¶; In many cases, one is interested in generating random quantum objects that correspond to composite systems generated using the qutip.tensor.tensor function. Specifying the tensor structure of a quantum object is done using the dims keyword argument in the same fashion as one would do for a qutip.Qobj object:; In [4]: rand_dm(4, 0.5, dims=[[2,2], [2,2]]); Out[4]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]], shape = [4, 4], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 0.30122934 0. 0. 0. ]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. ]; [ 0. 0. 0.34938533 0. ]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0.34938533]].

API documentatio... ». Modifying Internal QuTiP Settings¶. User Accessible Parameters¶; In this section we show how to modify a few of the internal parameters used by QuTiP. The settings that can be modified are given in the following table:. Setting; Description; Options. auto_herm; Automatically calculate the hermicity of; quantum objects.; True / False. auto_tidyup; Automatically tidyup quantum objects.; True / False. auto_tidyup_atol; Tolerance used by tidyup; any float value > 0. atol; General tolerance; any float value > 0. num_cpus; Number of CPU’s used for multiprocessing.; int between 1 and # cpu’s. debug; Show debug printouts.; True / False. Example: Changing Settings¶; The two most important settings are auto_tidyup and auto_tidyup_atol as they control whether the small elements of a quantum object should be removed, and what number should be considered as the cut-off tolerance.

The qutip.operators.sigmap operator acting on the spin state returns the zero vector. Why is this? To see what happened, let us use the qutip.operators.sigmaz operator:; In [51]: sigmaz(); Out[51]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = [2, 2], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 1. 0.]; [ 0. -1.]].

In [55]: sigmaz() * spin2; Out[55]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [-1.]]. The answer is now apparent. Since the QuTiP qutip.operators.sigmaz function uses the standard z-basis representation of the sigma-z spin operator, the spin state corresponds to the \(\left|\uparrow\right>\) state of a two-level spin system while spin2 gives the \(\left|\downarrow\right>\) state. Therefore, in our previous example sigmap() * spin, we raised the qubit state out of the truncated two-level Hilbert space resulting in the zero state.; While at first glance this convention might seem somewhat odd, it is in fact quite handy. For one, the spin operators remain in the conventional form. Second, when the spin system is in the \(\left|\uparrow\right>\) state:; In [56]: sigmaz() * spin; Out[56]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 0.]]. the non-zero component is the zeroth-element of the underlying matrix (remember that python uses c-indexing, and matrices start with the zeroth element).

This is because the qutip.expect function looks to see whether the operator is Hermitian or not. If the operator is Hermitian, than the output will always be real. In the case of non-Hermitian operators, the return values may be complex. Therefore, the qutip.expect function will return an array of complex values for non-Hermitian operators when the input is a list/array of states or density matrices.; Of course, the qutip.expect function works for spin states and operators:; In [71]: up = basis(2, 0).

This is because the qutip.expect function looks to see whether the operator is Hermitian or not. If the operator is Hermitian, than the output will always be real. In the case of non-Hermitian operators, the return values may be complex. Therefore, the qutip.expect function will return an array of complex values for non-Hermitian operators when the input is a list/array of states or density matrices.; Of course, the qutip.expect function works for spin states and operators:; In [71]: up = basis(2, 0).

Qubit (two-level) systems¶; Having spent a fair amount of time on basis states that represent harmonic oscillator states, we now move on to qubit, or two-level quantum systems (for example a spin-1/2). To create a state vector corresponding to a qubit system, we use the same qutip.states.basis, or qutip.states.fock, function with only two levels:; In [44]: spin = basis(2, 0). Now at this point one may ask how this state is different than that of a harmonic oscillator in the vacuum state truncated to two energy levels?; In [45]: vac = basis(2, 0). At this stage, there is no difference. This should not be surprising as we called the exact same function twice. The difference between the two comes from the action of the spin operators qutip.operators.sigmax, qutip.operators.sigmay, qutip.operators.sigmaz, qutip.operators.sigmap, and qutip.operators.sigmam on these two-level states. For example, if vac corresponds to the vacuum state of a harmonic oscillator, then, as we have already seen, we can use the raising operator to get the \(\left|1\right>\) state:; In [46]: vac; Out[46]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 0.]]. In [47]: c = create(2). In [48]: c * vac; Out[48]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = [2, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]]. For a spin system, the operator analogous to the raising operator is the sigma-plus operator qutip.operators.sigmap. Operating on the",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-states.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-states.html
https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-states.html:4504,Integrability,depend,dependence,4504,".]]. The raising operator has in indeed raised the state vec from the vacuum to the \(\left| 1\right>\) state. Instead of using the dagger Qobj.dag() method to raise the state, we could have also used the built in qutip.operators.create function to make a raising operator:; In [7]: c = create(5). In [8]: c * vac; Out[8]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. which does the same thing. We can raise the vacuum state more than once by successively apply the raising operator:; In [9]: c * c * vac; Out[9]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 1.41421356]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. or just taking the square of the raising operator \(\left(\hat{a}^\dagger\right)^{2}\):; In [10]: c ** 2 * vac; Out[10]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 1.41421356]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. Applying the raising operator twice gives the expected \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) dependence. We can use the product of \(c * a\) to also apply the number operator to the state vector vac:; In [11]: c * a * vac; Out[11]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or on the \(\left| 1\right>\) state:; In [12]: c * a * (c * vac); Out[12]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or the \(\left| 2\right>\) state:; In [13]: c * a * (c**2 * vac); Out[13]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 2.82842712]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. Notice how in this last example, application of the number operator does not give the expected value \(n=2\), but rather \(2\sqrt{2}\). This is because this last state is not normalized to unity as \(c\left| n\right> = \sqrt{n+1}\left| n+1\right>\). Therefore, we should normalize our vector first:; In [14]: c * a * (c**2 ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-states.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-states.html

Introduction¶; In the previous guide section Basic Operations on Quantum Objects, we saw how to create states and operators, using the functions built into QuTiP. In this portion of the guide, we will look at performing basic operations with states and operators. For more detailed demonstrations on how to use and manipulate these objects, see the examples on the tutorials web page. State Vectors (kets or bras)¶; Here we begin by creating a Fock qutip.states.basis vacuum state vector \(\left|0\right>\) with in a Hilbert space with 5 number states, from 0 to 4:; In [1]: vac = basis(5, 0). In [2]: vac; Out[2]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. and then create a lowering operator \(\left(\hat{a}\right)\) corresponding to 5 number states using the qutip.operators.destroy function:; In [3]: a = destroy(5). In [4]: a; Out[4]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [5]], shape = [5, 5], type = oper, isherm = False; Qobj data =; [[ 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. ]; [ 0. 0. 1.41421356 0. 0. ]; [ 0. 0. 0. 1.73205081 0. ]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 2. ]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. ]]. Now lets apply the destruction operator to our vacuum state vac,; In [5]: a * vac; Out[5",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-states.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-states.html

Of course, displacing the vacuum gives a coherent state, which can also be generated using the built in qutip.states.coherent function. Density matrices¶; One of the main purpose of QuTiP is to explore the dynamics of open quantum systems, where the most general state of a system is not longer a state vector, but rather a density matrix. Since operations on density matrices operate identically to those of vectors, we will just briefly highlight creating and using these structures.; The simplest density matrix is created by forming the outer-product \(\left|\psi\right>\left<\psi\right|\) of a ket vector:; In [28]: ket = basis(5, 2). In [29]: ket * ket.dag(); Out[29]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [5]], shape = [5, 5], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]. A similar task can also be accomplished via the qutip.states.fock_dm or qutip.states.ket2dm functions:; In [30]: fock_dm(5, 2); Out[30]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [5]], shape = [5, 5], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]].

In contrast, iterative methods such as the 'iterative-gmres', 'iterative-lgmres', and 'iterative-bicgstab' methods do not factor the matrix and thus take less memory than these previous methods and allowing, in principle, for extremely large system sizes. The downside is that these methods can take much longer than the direct method as the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is large, indicating that these iterative methods require a large number of iterations for convergence. To overcome this, one can use a preconditioner \(M\) that solves for an approximate inverse for the (modified) Liouvillian, thus better conditioning the problem, leading to faster convergence. The use of a preconditioner can actually make these iterative methods faster than the other solution methods. The problem with precondioning is that it is only well defined for Hermitian matrices. Since the Liouvillian is non-Hermitian, the ability to find a good preconditioner is not guaranteed. And moreover, if a preconditioner is found, it is not guaranteed to have a good condition number.

An Overview of t... ». Solving for Steady-State Solutions¶. Introduction¶; For time-independent open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as \(t\rightarrow\infty\) that satisfies the equation. \[\frac{d\hat{\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=\mathcal{L}\hat{\rho}_{ss}=0.\]; Although the requirement for time-independence seems quite resitrictive, one can often employ a transformation to the interaction picture that yields a time-independent Hamiltonian. For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find. Steady State Solutions for Arbitrary Systems¶. Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by qutip.steadystate.steadystate. This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, each with their own pros and cons, where the method used can be chosen using the method keyword argument.; Available Steady-State Methods:.

This state is slightly more complicated, describing two qubits in a superposition between the up and down states, while the third qubit is in its ground state.; To construct operators that act on an extended Hilbert space of a combined system, we similarly pass a list of operators for each component system to the qutip.tensor.tensor function.

For example, the operator that represents \(\sigma_z\) on the first qubit in a two-qubit system, while leaving the second qubit unaffected:; In [5]: tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)); Out[5]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]], shape = [4, 4], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 1. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 1. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. -1. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0. -1.]]. Example: Constructing composite Hamiltonians¶; The qutip.tensor.tensor function is extensively used when constructing Hamiltonians for composite systems. Here we’ll look at some simple examples. Two coupled qubits¶; First, let’s consider a system of two coupled qubits. Assume that both qubit has equal energy splitting, and that the qubits are coupled through a \(\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x\) interaction with strength g = 0.05 (in units where the bare qubit energy splitting is unity). The Hamiltonian describing this system is:; In [6]: H = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)) + tensor(identity(2),; ...: sigmaz()) + 0.05 * tensor(sigmax(), sigmax()); ...: . In [7]: H; Out[7]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]], shape = [4, 4], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 2. 0. 0. 0.05]; [ 0. 0. 0.05 0. ]; [ 0. 0.05 0. 0. ]; [ 0.05 0. 0. -2. ]]. Three coupled qubits¶; The two-qubit example is easily generalized to three coupled qubits:; In [8]: H = (tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2), identity(2)) +; ...: tensor(identity(2), sigmaz(), identity(2)) +; ...: tensor(identity(2), identity(2), sigmaz()) +; ...: 0.5 * tensor(sigmax(), sigmax(), identity(2)) +; ...: 0.25 * tens",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-tensor.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-tensor.html

A two-level system coupled to a cavity: The Jaynes-Cummings model¶; The simplest possible quantum mechanical description for light-matter interaction is encapsulated in the Jaynes-Cummings model, which describes the coupling between a two-level atom and a single-mode electromagnetic field (a cavity mode). Denoting the energy splitting of the atom and cavity omega_a and omega_c, respectively, and the atom-cavity interaction strength g, the Jaynes-Cumming Hamiltonian can be constructed as:; In [10]: N = 10. In [11]: omega_a = 1.0. In [12]: omega_c = 1.25. In [13]: g = 0.05. In [14]: a = tensor(identity(2), destroy(N)). In [15]: sm = tensor(destroy(2), identity(N)). In [16]: sz = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(N)). In [17]: H = 0.5 * omega_a * sz + omega_c * a.dag() * a + g * (a.dag() * sm + a * sm.dag()). Here N is the number of Fock states included in the cavity mode. Partial trace¶; The partial trace is an operation that reduces the dimension of a Hilbert space by eliminating some degrees of freedom by averaging (tracing). In this sense it is therefore the converse of the tensor product. It is useful when one is interested in only a part of",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-tensor.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-tensor.html

Similarly, we can use the function qutip.visualization.hinton, which is; used below to visualize the corresponding steadystate density matrix:; In [74]: rho_ss = steadystate(H, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a, np.sqrt(0.4) * b.dag()]). In [75]: fig, ax = hinton(rho_ss) # xlabels=xlabels, ylabels=xlabels). In [76]: plt.show(). Quantum process tomography¶; Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a useful technique for characterizing experimental implementations of quantum gates involving a small number of qubits. It can also be a useful theoretical tool that can give insight in how a process transforms states, and it can be used for example to study how noise or other imperfections deteriorate a gate. Whereas a fidelity or distance measure can give a single number that indicates how far from ideal a gate is, a quantum process tomography analysis can give detailed information about exactly what kind of errors various imperfections introduce.; The idea is to construct a transformation matrix for a quantum process (for example a quantum gate) that describes how the density matrix of a system is transformed by the process. We can then decompose the transformation in some operator basis that represent well-defined and easily interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix).

Visualization of quantum states and processes¶; Visualization is often an important complement to a simulation of a quantum; mechanical system. The first method of visualization that come to mind might be; to plot the expectation values of a few selected operators. But on top of that,; it can often be instructive to visualize for example the state vectors or; density matices that describe the state of the system, or how the state is; transformed as a function of time (see process tomography below). In this; section we demonstrate how QuTiP and matplotlib can be used to perform a few; types of visualizations that often can provide additional understanding of; quantum system. Fock-basis probability distribution¶; In quantum mechanics probability distributions plays an important role, and as; in statistics, the expectation values computed from a probability distribution; does not reveal the full story. For example, consider an quantum harmonic; oscillator mode with Hamiltonian \(H = \hbar\omega a^\dagger a\), which is; in a state described by its density matrix \(\rho\), and which on average; is occupied by two photons, \(\mathrm{Tr}[\rho a^\dagger a] = 2\). Given; this information we cannot say whether the oscillator is in a Fock state,; a thermal state, a coherent state, etc. By visualizing the photon distribution; in the Fock state basis important clues about the underlying state can be; obtained.; One convenient way to visualize a probability distribution is to use histograms.; Consider the following histogram visualization of the number-basis probability; distribut",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-visualization.html
https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-visualization.html:13554,Security,access,access,13554,"interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix). Given an orthogonal operator basis of our choice \(\{B_i\}_i^{N^2}\), which satisfies \({\rm Tr}[B_i^\dagger B_j] = N\delta_{ij}\), we can write the map as. (2)\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger.\]; where \(\chi_{mn} = \sum_{ij} b_{im}b_{jn}^*\) and \(A_i = \sum_{m} b_{im}B_{m}\). Here, matrix \(\chi\) is the transformation matrix we are after, since it describes how much \(B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger\) contributes to \(\rho_{\rm out}\).; In a numerical simulation of a quantum process we usually do not have access to the quantum map in the form Eq. (1). Instead, what we usually can do is to calculate the propagator \(U\) for the density matrix in superoperator form, using for example the QuTiP function qutip.propagator.propagator. We can then write. \[\epsilon(\tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}) = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = \tilde{\rho}_{\rm out}\]; where \(\tilde{\rho}\) is the vector representation of the density matrix \(\rho\). If we write Eq. (2) in superoperator form as well we obtain. \[\tilde{\rho}_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}.\]; so we can identify. \[U = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger.\]; Now this is a linear equation systems for the \(N^2 \times N^2\) elements in \(\chi\). We can solve it by writing \(\chi\) and the superoperator propagator as \([N^4]\) vectors, and likewise write the superoperator product \(\tilde{B}_m\tilde{B}_n^\dagger\) as a \([N^4\times N^4]\) matrix \(",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/guide-visualization.html

Introduction¶; The Lindblad master equation introduced earlier is constructed so that it describes a physical evolution of the density matrix (i.e., trace and positivity preserving), but it does not provide a connection to any underlaying microscopic physical model. ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

This assumption is known as the Born approximation, and it implies that there never is any entanglement between the system and the bath, neither in the initial state nor at any time during the evolution. It is justified for weak system-bath interaction.; The master equation (1) is non-Markovian, i.e., the change in the density matrix at a time \(t\) depends on states at all times \(\tau < t\), making it intractable to solve both theoretically and numerically. To make progress towards a manageable master equation, we now introduce the Markovian approximation, in which \(\rho(s)\) is replaced by \(\rho(t)\) in Eq. (1). The result is the Redfield equation. (2)\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^t d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]],\]; which is local in time with respect the density matrix, but still not Markovian since it contains an implicit dependence on the initial state. By extending the integration to infinity and substituting \(\tau \rightarrow t-\tau\), a fully Markovian master equation is obtained:. (3)\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^\infty d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(t-\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]].\]; The two Markovian approximations introduced above are valid if the time-scale with which the system dynamics changes is large compared to the time-scale with which correlations in the bath decays (corresponding to a “short-memory” bath, which results in Markovian system dynamics).; The master equation (3) is still on a too general form to be suitable for numerical implementation. We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\t",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

It takes five mandatory arguments: the Bloch-Redfield tensor R, the list of eigenkets ekets, the initial state psi0 (as a ket or density matrix), a list of times tlist for which to evaluate the expectation values, and a list of operators e_ops for which to evaluate the expectation values at each time step defined by tlist. For example, to evaluate the expectation values of the \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) operators for the example above, we can use the following code:; In [6]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. In [7]: tlist = np.linspace(0, 15.0, 1000). In [8]: psi0 = rand_ket(2). In [9]: e_ops = [sigmax(), sigmay(), sigmaz()]. In [10]: expt_list = bloch_redfield_solve(R, ekets, psi0, tlist, e_ops). In [11]: sphere = Bloch(). In [12]: sphere.add_points([expt_list[0], expt_list[1], expt_list[2]]). In [13]: sphere.vector_color = ['r']. In [14]: sphere.add_vectors(np.array([delta, 0, eps0]) / np.sqrt(delta ** 2 + eps0 ** 2)). In [15]: sphere.make_sphere(). In [16]: plt.show(). The two steps of calculating the Bloch-Redfield tensor and evolve the corresponding master equation can be combined into one by using the function qutip.bloch_redfield.brmesolve, which takes same arguments as qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, expect for the additional list of spectral callback functions.; In [17]: output = brmesolve(H, psi0, tlist, [sigmax()], e_ops, [ohmic_spectrum]). where the resulting output is an instance of the class qutip.solver.Result.

Introduction¶; Many time-dependent problems of interest are periodic. The dynamics of such systems can be solved for directly by numerical integration of the Schrödinger or Master equation, using the time-dependent Hamiltonian. But they can also be transformed into time-independent problems using the Floquet formalism. Time-independent problems can be solve much more efficiently, so such a transformation is often very desirable.; In the standard derivations of the Lindblad and Bloch-Redfield master equations the Hamiltonian describing the system under consideration is assumed to be time independent. Thus, strictly speaking, the standard forms of these master equation formalisms should not blindly be applied to system with time-dependent Hamiltonians. However, in many relevant cases, in particular for weak driving, the standard master equations still turns out to be useful for many time-dependent problems. But a more rigorous approach would be to rederive the master equation taking the time-dependent nature of the Hamiltonian into account from the start.

Introduction¶; Many time-dependent problems of interest are periodic. The dynamics of such systems can be solved for directly by numerical integration of the Schrödinger or Master equation, using the time-dependent Hamiltonian. But they can also be transformed into time-independent problems using the Floquet formalism. Time-independent problems can be solve much more efficiently, so such a transformation is often very desirable.; In the standard derivations of the Lindblad and Bloch-Redfield master equations the Hamiltonian describing the system under consideration is assumed to be time independent. Thus, strictly speaking, the standard forms of these master equation formalisms should not blindly be applied to system with time-dependent Hamiltonians. However, in many relevant cases, in particular for weak driving, the standard master equations still turns out to be useful for many time-dependent problems. But a more rigorous approach would be to rederive the master equation taking the time-dependent nature of the Hamiltonian into account from the start. The Floquet-Markov Master equation is one such a formalism, with important applications for strongly driven systems (see e.g., [Gri98]).; Here we give an overview of how the Floquet and Floquet-Markov formalisms can be used for solving time-dependent problems in QuTiP.

Pre-computing the Floquet modes for one period¶; When evaluating the Floquet states or the wavefunction at many points in time it is useful to pre-compute the Floquet modes for the first period of the driving with the required resolution. In QuTiP the function qutip.floquet.floquet_modes_table calculates a table of Floquet modes which later can be used together with the function qutip.floquet.floquet_modes_t_lookup to efficiently lookup the Floquet mode at an arbitrary time.

Note; Currently the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve can only accept a single environment coupling operator and spectral-density function. The noise spectral-density function of the environment is implemented as a Python callback function that is passed to the solver. For example:; >>> gamma1 = 0.1; >>> def noise_spectrum(omega):; >>> return 0.5 * gamma1 * omega/(2*pi). The other parameters are similar to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the same format for the return value is used qutip.solver.Result.

By substituting (2) into the Schrödinger equation (1) we obtain an eigenvalue equation for the Floquet modes and quasienergies. (4)\[ \mathcal{H}(t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \epsilon_\alpha\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; where \(\mathcal{H}(t) = H(t) - i\hbar\partial_t\). This eigenvalue problem could be solved analytically or numerically, but in QuTiP we use an alternative approach for numerically finding the Floquet states and quasienergies [see e.g. Creffield et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 165301 (2003)]. Consider the propagator for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (1), which by definition satisfies. \[U(T+t,t)\Psi(t) = \Psi(T+t).\]; Inserting the Floquet states from (2) into this expression results in. \[U(T+t,t)\exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha(T+t)/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(T+t),\]; or, since \(\Phi_\alpha(T+t)=\Phi_\alpha(t)\),. \[U(T+t,t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha T/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \eta_\alpha \Phi_\alpha(t),\]; which shows that the Floquet modes are eigenstates of the one-period propagator. We can therefore find the Floquet modes and quasienergies \(\epsilon_\alpha = -\hbar\arg(\eta_\alpha)/T\) by numerically calculating \(U(T+t,t)\) and diagonalizing it. In particular this method is useful to find \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) by calculating and diagonalize \(U(T,0)\).; The Floquet modes at arbitrary time \(t\) can then be found by propagating \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) to \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) using the wave function propagator \(U(t,0)\Psi_\alpha(0) = \Psi_\alpha(t)\), which for the Floquet mod",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html

In particular this method is useful to find \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) by calculating and diagonalize \(U(T,0)\).; The Floquet modes at arbitrary time \(t\) can then be found by propagating \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) to \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) using the wave function propagator \(U(t,0)\Psi_\alpha(0) = \Psi_\alpha(t)\), which for the Floquet modes yields. \[U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; so that \(\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar) U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0)\). Since \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) is periodic we only need to evaluate it for \(t \in [0, T]\), and from \(\Phi_\alpha(t \in [0,T])\) we can directly evaluate \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\), \(\Psi_\alpha(t)\) and \(\Psi(t)\) for arbitrary large \(t\).

This matrix equation can, in principle, be solved by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix \(H\). In practice, however, it is difficult to perform this diagonalization unless the size of the Hilbert space (dimension of the matrix \(H\)) is small. Analytically, it is a formidable task to calculate the dynamics for systems with more than two states. If, in addition, we consider dissipation due to the inevitable interaction with a surrounding environment, the computational complexity grows even larger, and we have to resort to numerical calculations in all realistic situations. This illustrates the importance of numerical calculations in describing the dynamics of open quantum systems, and the need for efficient and accessible tools for this task.; The Schrödinger equation, which governs the time-evolution of closed quantum systems, is defined by its Hamiltonian and state vector.

Non-unitary evolution¶; While the evolution of the state vector in a closed quantum system is deterministic, open quantum systems are stochastic in nature. The effect of an environment on the system of interest is to induce stochastic transitions between energy levels, and to introduce uncertainty in the phase difference between states of the system. The state of an open quantum system is therefore described in terms of ensemble averaged states using the density matrix formalism. A density matrix \(\rho\) describes a probability distribution of quantum states \(\left|\psi_n\right>\), in a matrix representation \(\rho = \sum_n p_n \left|\psi_n\right>\left<\psi_n\right|\), where \(p_n\) is the classical probability that the system is in the quantum state \(\left|\psi_n\right>\). The time evolution of a density matrix \(\rho\) is the topic of the remaining portions of this section. The Lindblad Master equation¶; The standard approach for deriving the equations of motion for a system interacting with its environment is to expand the scope of the system to include the environment.

The combined quantum system is then closed, and its evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation. (2)\[\dot \rho_{\rm tot}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H_{\rm tot}, \rho_{\rm tot}(t)],\]; the equivalent of the Schrödinger equation (1) in the density matrix formalism. Here, the total Hamiltonian. \[H_{\rm tot} = H_{\rm sys} + H_{\rm env} + H_{\rm int},\]; includes the original system Hamiltonian \(H_{\rm sys}\), the Hamiltonian for the environment \(H_{\rm env}\), and a term representing the interaction between the system and its environment \(H_{\rm int}\). Since we are only interested in the dynamics of the system, we can at this point perform a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom in Eq. (2), and thereby obtain a master equation for the motion of the original system density matrix. The most general trace-preserving and completely positive form of this evolution is the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix \(\rho = {\rm Tr}_{\rm env}[\rho_{\rm tot}]\). (3)\[\dot\rho(t)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[H(t),\rho(t)]+\sum_n \frac{1}{2} \left[2 C_n \rho(t) C_n^{+} - \rho(t) C_n^{+} C_n - C_n^{+} C_n \rho(t)\right]\]; where the \(C_n = \sqrt{\gamma_n} A_n\) are collapse operators, and \(A_n\) are the operators through which the environment couples to the system in \(H_{\rm int}\), and \(\gamma_n\) are the corresponding rates. The derivation of Eq. (3) may be found in several sources, and will not be reproduced here. Instead, we emphasize the approximations that are required to arrive at the master equation in the form of Eq. (3) from physical arguments, and hence perform a calculation in QuTiP:. Separability: At \(t=0\) there are no correlations between the system and its environment such that the total density matrix can be written as a tensor product \(\rho^I_{\rm tot}(0) = \rho^I(0) \otimes \rho^I_{\rm env}(0)\).; Born approximation: Requires: (1) that the",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html

These assumptions are justified if the interaction is weak, and if the environment is much larger than the system. In summary, \(\rho_{\rm tot}(t) \approx \rho(t)\otimes\rho_{\rm env}\).; Markov approximation The time-scale of decay for the environment \(\tau_{\rm env}\) is much shorter than the smallest time-scale of the system dynamics \(\tau_{\rm sys} \gg \tau_{\rm env}\). This approximation is often deemed a “short-memory environment” as it requires that environmental correlation functions decay on a time-scale fast compared to those of the system.; Secular approximation Stipulates that elements in the master equation corresponding to transition frequencies satisfy \(|\omega_{ab}-\omega_{cd}| \ll 1/\tau_{\rm sys}\), i.e., all fast rotating terms in the interaction picture can be neglected. It also ignores terms that lead to a small renormalization of the system energy levels. This approximation is not strictly necessary for all master-equation formalisms (e.g., the Block-Redfield master equation), but it is required for arriving at the Lindblad form (3) which is used in qutip.mesolve. For systems with environments satisfying the conditions outlined above, the Lindblad master equation (3) governs the time-evolution of the system density matrix, giving an ensemble average of the system dynamics. In order to ensure that these approximations are not violated, it is important that the decay rates \(\gamma_n\) be smaller than the minimum energy splitting in the system Hamiltonian.

(2)\[\dot \rho_{\rm tot}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H_{\rm tot}, \rho_{\rm tot}(t)],\]; the equivalent of the Schrödinger equation (1) in the density matrix formalism. Here, the total Hamiltonian. \[H_{\rm tot} = H_{\rm sys} + H_{\rm env} + H_{\rm int},\]; includes the original system Hamiltonian \(H_{\rm sys}\), the Hamiltonian for the environment \(H_{\rm env}\), and a term representing the interaction between the system and its environment \(H_{\rm int}\). Since we are only interested in the dynamics of the system, we can at this point perform a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom in Eq. (2), and thereby obtain a master equation for the motion of the original system density matrix. The most general trace-preserving and completely positive form of this evolution is the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix \(\rho = {\rm Tr}_{\rm env}[\rho_{\rm tot}]\). (3)\[\dot\rho(t)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[H(t),\rho(t)]+\sum_n \frac{1}{2} \left[2 C_n \rho(t) C_n^{+} - \rho(t) C_n^{+} C_n - C_n^{+} C_n \rho(t)\right]\]; where the \(C_n = \sqrt{\gamma_n} A_n\) are collapse operators, and \(A_n\) are the operators through which the environment couples to the system in \(H_{\rm int}\), and \(\gamma_n\) are the corresponding rates. The derivation of Eq. (3) may be found in several sources, and will not be reproduced here. Instead, we emphasize the approximations that are required to arrive at the master equation in the form of Eq. (3) from physical arguments, and hence perform a calculation in QuTiP:.",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html

Instead, we emphasize the approximations that are required to arrive at the master equation in the form of Eq. (3) from physical arguments, and hence perform a calculation in QuTiP:. Separability: At \(t=0\) there are no correlations between the system and its environment such that the total density matrix can be written as a tensor product \(\rho^I_{\rm tot}(0) = \rho^I(0) \otimes \rho^I_{\rm env}(0)\).; Born approximation: Requires: (1) that the state of the environment does not significantly change as a result of the interaction with the system; (2) The system and the environment remain separable throughout the evolution. These assumptions are justified if the interaction is weak, and if the environment is much larger than the system. In summary, \(\rho_{\rm tot}(t) \approx \rho(t)\otimes\rho_{\rm env}\).; Markov approximation The time-scale of decay for the environment \(\tau_{\rm env}\) is much shorter than the smallest time-scale of the system dynamics \(\tau_{\rm sys} \gg \tau_{\rm env}\).

This matrix equation can, in principle, be solved by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix \(H\). In practice, however, it is difficult to perform this diagonalization unless the size of the Hilbert space (dimension of the matrix \(H\)) is small. Analytically, it is a formidable task to calculate the dynamics for systems with more than two states. If, in addition, we consider dissipation due to the inevitable interaction with a surrounding environment, the computational complexity grows even larger, and we have to resort to numerical calculations in all realistic situations. This illustrates the importance of numerical calculations in describing the dynamics of open quantum systems, and the need for efficient and accessible tools for this task.; The Schrödinger equation, which governs the time-evolution of closed quantum systems, is defined by its Hamiltonian and state vector. In the previous section, Using Tensor Products and Partial Traces, we showed how Hamiltonians and state vectors are constructed in QuTiP. Given a Hamiltonian, we can calculate the unitary (non-dissipative) time-evolution of an arbitrary state vector \(\left|\psi_0\right>\) (psi0) using the QuTiP function qutip.mesolve. It evolves the state vector and evaluates the expectation values for a set of operators expt_ops at the points in time in the list times, using an ordinary differential equation solver. Alternatively, we can use the function qutip.essolve, which uses the exponential-series technique to calculate the time evolution of a system. The qutip.mesolve and qutip.essolve functions take the same arguments and it is therefore easy switch between the two solvers.; ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html

If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run. However, like many other options in QuTiP you are free to change the number of trajectories to fit your needs. If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; In [14]: data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm], ntraj=1000); 10.0%.

Introduction¶; Where as the density matrix formalism describes the ensemble average over many identical realizations of a quantum system, the Monte Carlo (MC), or quantum-jump approach to wave function evolution, allows for simulating an individual realization of the system dynamics. Here, the environment is continuously monitored, resulting in a series of quantum jumps in the system wave function, conditioned on the increase in information gained about the state of the system via the environmental measurements. In general, this evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. (1)\[H_{\rm eff}=H_{\rm sys}-\frac{i\hbar}{2}\sum_{i}C^{+}_{n}C_{n},\]; where again, the \(C_{n}\) are collapse operators, each corresponding to a separate irreversible process with rate \(\gamma_{n}\). Here, the strictly negative non-Hermitian portion of Eq. (1) gives rise to a reduction in the norm of the wave function, that to first-order in a small time \(\delta t\), is given by \(\left<\psi(t+\delta t)|\psi(t+\delta t)\right>=1-\delta p\) where. (2)\[\begin{split}\delta p =\delta t \sum_{n}\left<\psi(t)|C^{+}_{n}C_{n}|\psi(t)\right>,\end{split}\]; and \(\delta t\) is such that \(\delta p \ll 1\). With a probability of remaining in the state \(\left|\psi(t+\delta t)\right>\) given by \(1-\delta p\), the corresponding quantum jump probability is thus Eq.

(1)\[H_{\rm eff}=H_{\rm sys}-\frac{i\hbar}{2}\sum_{i}C^{+}_{n}C_{n},\]; where again, the \(C_{n}\) are collapse operators, each corresponding to a separate irreversible process with rate \(\gamma_{n}\). Here, the strictly negative non-Hermitian portion of Eq. (1) gives rise to a reduction in the norm of the wave function, that to first-order in a small time \(\delta t\), is given by \(\left<\psi(t+\delta t)|\psi(t+\delta t)\right>=1-\delta p\) where. (2)\[\begin{split}\delta p =\delta t \sum_{n}\left<\psi(t)|C^{+}_{n}C_{n}|\psi(t)\right>,\end{split}\]; and \(\delta t\) is such that \(\delta p \ll 1\). With a probability of remaining in the state \(\left|\psi(t+\delta t)\right>\) given by \(1-\delta p\), the corresponding quantum jump probability is thus Eq. (2).",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html

The advantage of the Monte Carlo method over the master equation approach is that only the state vector is required to be kept in the computers memory, as opposed to the entire density matrix. For large quantum system this becomes a significant advantage, and the Monte Carlo solver is therefore generally recommended for such systems. For example, simulating a Heisenberg spin-chain consisting of 10 spins with random parameters and initial states takes almost 7 times longer using the master equation rather than Monte Carlo approach with the default number of trajectories running on a quad-CPU machine. Furthermore, it takes about 7 times the memory as well. However, for small systems, the added overhead of averaging a large number of stochastic trajectories to obtain the open system dynamics, as well as starting the multiprocessing functionality, outweighs the benefit of the minor (in this case) memory saving. Master equation methods are therefore generally more efficient when Hilbert space sizes are on the order of a couple of hundred states or smaller.; Like the master equation solver qutip.mesolve, the Monte Carlo solver returns a qutip.solver.Result object consisting of expectation values, if the user has defined expectation value operators in the 5th argument to mcsolve, or state vectors if no expectation value operators are given. If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively.

The Monte Carlo solver also has many available options that can be set using the qutip.solver.Options class as discussed in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Reusing Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. In order to solve a given simulation as fast as possible, the solvers in QuTiP take the given input operators and break them down into simpler components before passing them on to the ODE solvers. Although these operations are reasonably fast, the time spent organizing data can become appreciable when repeatedly solving a system over, for example, many different initial conditions. In cases such as this, the Hamiltonian and other operators may be reused after the initial configuration, thus speeding up calculations. Note that, unless you are planning to reuse the data many times, this functionality will not be very useful.; To turn on the “reuse” functionality we must set the rhs_reuse=True flag in the qutip.solver.Options:; In [20]: options = Options(rhs_reuse=True). A full account of this feature is given in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Using the previous example, we will calculate the dynamics for two different initial states, with the Hamiltonian data being reused on the second call; In [21]: psi0 = tensor(fock(2, 0), fock(10, 5)).

Monte Carlo in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, Monte Carlo evolution is implemented with the qutip.mcsolve function. It takes nearly the same arguments as the qutip.mesolve; function for master-equation evolution, except that the initial state must be a ket vector, as oppose to a density matrix, and there is an optional keyword parameter ntraj that defines the number of stochastic trajectories to be simulated. By default, ntraj=500 indicating that 500 Monte Carlo trajectories will be performed.; To illustrate the use of the Monte Carlo evolution of quantum systems in QuTiP, let’s again consider the case of a two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity.

If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; In [14]: data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm], ntraj=1000); 10.0%.
