I’ve had multiple conversations now with users that don’t know how to get started with Query-on-Batch, and often are not aware of how such a thing would differ from running Spark-local Query inside a Batch job. We’re now beginning to attract Broad users who don’t necessarily know or have an interest in Batch itself, rather just want serverless Query. We should have a piece of documentation that Query users can follow to start using Query-on-Batch without needing to dig through the lower-level Batch documentation (they won’t find answers there anyway) or know to find the `hl.init` setting that changes the backend. ### Version. 0.2.130. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14493

In older versions of hail (tested with 0.2.115), when starting a dataproc cluster with VEP, e.g.; ```{bash}; hailctl dataproc start hail-test --region australia-southeast1 --project my-project --vep GRCh38 --packages gnomad --num-workers 2; ```; the dataproc cluster command would be provided the following environment variable through the `--metadata` flag: `VEP_REPLICATE=aus-sydney`. This variable is used within the script `gs://hail-common/hailctl/dataproc/0.2.115/vep-GRCh38.sh` to determine which bucket to pull the VEP cache data from. In more recent versions (tested with 0.2.130), this `VEP_REPLICATE` variable has been changed to `VEP_REPLICATE=australia-southeast1`, however the Australian bucket containing the VEP cache data is still `aus-sydney`, meaning that the VEP data is not copied into the dataproc cluster, and when trying to run VEP I get the error `No cache found for homo_sapiens, version 95`. ### Version. 0.2.130. ### Relevant log output. ```shell; FatalError: HailException: VEP command '/vep --format vcf --json --everything --allele_number --no_stats --cache --offline --minimal --assembly GRCh38 --fasta /opt/vep/.vep/homo_sapiens/95_GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa.gz --plugin LoF,loftee_path:/opt/vep/Plugins/,gerp_bigwig:/opt/vep/.vep/gerp_conservation_scores.homo_sapiens.GRCh38.bw,human_ancestor_fa:/opt/vep/.vep/human_ancestor.fa.gz,conservation_file:/opt/vep/.vep/loftee.sql --dir_plugins /opt/vep/Plugins/ -o STDOUT' failed with non-zero exit status 2; VEP Error output:; Smartmatch is experimental at /opt/vep/Plugins/de_novo_donor.pl line 175.; Smartmatch is experimental at /opt/vep/Plugins/de_novo_donor.pl line 214.; Smartmatch is experimental at /opt/vep/Plugins/splice_site_scan.pl line 191.; Smartmatch is experimental at /opt/vep/Plugins/splice_site_scan.pl line 194.; Smartmatch is experimental at /opt/vep/Plugins/splice_site_scan.pl line 238.; Smartmatch is experimental at /opt/vep/Plugins/splice_site_scan.pl line 241",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14513

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14522:122,Availability,avail,available,122,"### What happened?. Note: this is an Azure-specific issue. When submitting a batch/job that requests more storage than is available on the temp disk of any standing worker, but doesn't request a specific number of cores or amount of memory, a NotImplementedError is raised in `batch/cloud/azure/worker/disk.py`. See this Batch record for an example of the issue in action: https://batch.azure.hail.is/batches/4563654/jobs/1. The corresponding base case to reproduce this is:. ```python; import hailtop.batch as hb; backend = hb.ServiceBackend(billing_project=""<YOUR BILLING PROJECT>""); b = hb.Batch(backend=backend, name=""storage_test""); j = b.new_job(); j.image(""ubuntu:20.04""); j.storage(""700GiB""); j.command(""df -h""); b.run(wait=False); ```. On the cluster azure.hail.is this job gets scheduled on a `Standard_D16ds_v4` instance which has a 600 GiB temp disk. On GCP, when requests exceed this amount a data disk is provisioned to service the request. While this is feasible on Azure and could be implemented, it may not be the recommended solution as temp disks are much better suited to ephemeral workloads than data disks. On clusters with a smaller standing worker (i.e. fewer cores) there is a workaround, which also possibly suggests a reasonable partial solution. This workaround is to specify a required number of cores that forces a larger VM of the same family to be provisioned. This makes a larger temp disk available for the job to leverage. The corresponding partial solution would be to take knowledge of the temp disk size for any VM into account when scheduling jobs and provision larger VMs when warranted by the storage requirement of a job. . Based on current limitations for VM core count (16) this suggests a ceiling on storage that can be allocated to any job in Azure of 600 GiB. At that point it would be necessary to allocate a data disk.

When the QoB client on a user's laptop sends a request to create a QoB job, it sends a `jar_spec` parameter as part of the job spec that is either:; - `git_revision`: the git SHA that the hail was built with. The Batch front end takes this and resolves a URL for the published JAR that was created when that commit was merged to `main`.; - `jar_url`: A blob storage URL that points directly to the JAR to use. The Batch front end ensures that this URL is trusted. The `jar_url` setting is mainly for development and debugging purposes, allowing a dev or user to set a URL to a development JAR instead of using a merged commit. In normal configuration fashion, it is possible to set `jar_url` in `hailctl config`. This is an enormous footgun, as users may forget to unset this configuration and continue using the dev jar *even after they install a different hail wheel*. We must do two things:; 1. Remove the ability to set the jar_url through `hailctl` so as to avoid this footgun. Batch should also fully remove support for `jar_url`s so that any users who might be inadvertently using it are loudly alerted (though I suspect there are few if any such users now).; 2. Remove entirely the ability to specify a JAR other than that which was built along with the installed wheel. The proposed plan is to always send `git_revision` for QoB jobs. In order to enable development JARs, Batch should be augmented to search first for production JARs matching a certain revision, and then if that fails search a specified `dev/` subdirectory for the requested revision.

The Batch front end takes this and resolves a URL for the published JAR that was created when that commit was merged to `main`.; - `jar_url`: A blob storage URL that points directly to the JAR to use. The Batch front end ensures that this URL is trusted. The `jar_url` setting is mainly for development and debugging purposes, allowing a dev or user to set a URL to a development JAR instead of using a merged commit. In normal configuration fashion, it is possible to set `jar_url` in `hailctl config`. This is an enormous footgun, as users may forget to unset this configuration and continue using the dev jar *even after they install a different hail wheel*. We must do two things:; 1. Remove the ability to set the jar_url through `hailctl` so as to avoid this footgun. Batch should also fully remove support for `jar_url`s so that any users who might be inadvertently using it are loudly alerted (though I suspect there are few if any such users now).; 2. Remove entirely the ability to specify a JAR other than that which was built along with the installed wheel. The proposed plan is to always send `git_revision` for QoB jobs. In order to enable development JARs, Batch should be augmented to search first for production JARs matching a certain revision, and then if that fails search a specified `dev/` subdirectory for the requested revision.

For azure instances, the 64 Core E machines are said to have 8192 mib per core of memory which is incorrect. The machine has 504 Gib = 516096 Mib of memory, which equates to 516096/64 = 8064 mib per core. The other E instances do indeed have 8192 mib per core. In gcp, the highcpu machines are said to have 924 mib per core which is not correct either. These machines do not have in integer number of mib per machine.

This change relaxes the requirement of the error response string to fix transient error handling for our current version of `aiohttp`. I wish I had a better approach. `ClientPayloadError` can also be thrown in the case of malformed data, so I am reticent to treat it as always transient, but we could perhaps make it a `limited_retries_error` and avoid inspecting the error message.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14545

Hail propagates nicely explained error messages from java to python when an exception is thrown in the user's pipeline. However, the hail python front end does not handle a situation where the java backend disappears entirely, which can happen in the case of an OOM killer killing the JVM. The result is an error as seen below. In such a scenario, the python front end should add a useful message suggesting that the backend is not reachable and might have run out of memory. ### Version. 0.2.130. ### Relevant log output. ```shell; File ~/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/hail/table.py:2814, in Table.collect(self, _localize, _timed); 2812 e = construct_expr(rows_ir, hl.tarray(t.row.dtype)); 2813 if _localize:; → 2814 return Env.backend().execute(e._ir, timed=_timed); 2815 else:; 2816 return e.

Currently, the `ServiceBackend`'s implementation of collect distributed array submits a job group full of worker jobs (1 per partition) and waits for the job group to complete before reading the results of the worker jobs. For small analyses this is fine, but when a query has tens of thousands of partitions it can take time to schedule and complete all of the worker jobs and reading back those results on the driver can become a bottleneck. Below is one possible solution to this problem:. #### Expose log for job completions in a job group. The Query Driver should attempt to read worker job results while the stage is running, but to do this it needs the Batch API to provide an append-only log of completed jobs in a job group that the Query Driver can consume instead of issuing O(jobs) job status requests during each stage. It may be that this is already possible with the current database schema, but can at worst be achieved by creating an indexed column on jobs that contain the spot they completed in in the job group. . Completion of this feature would require:; - Carefully evaluating the Batch data model to determine if there are any database changes necessary to construct an append-only log of job completions in a job group from the state of the database; - If changes are needed, design and implement a batch front end API endpoint to query the log; - (Separately) Add support for streaming the log in the Scala BatchClient and use it to read partition results before the job group completes. ### Version. 0.2.132. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14607

All batches, jobs, and attempts are forever persisted in the Batch database. This is rarely a performance problem, as the indexes ensure that old rows are rarely ever looked at, but the fact that the database storage is monotonically increasing is something that we have to reckon with, and it makes migrations very time intensive. There are certainly many improvements that can be made to waste less space in the database (like #14623), but ultimately we will need to make a decision about how long we should persist batches. We should quantify the utility of historic batches, what might be a good cutoff or alternative process for expiring batches, and whether we should provide some sort of export that users can use to own information about their batches. I imagine the most relevant information would be cost and logs. ### Version. 0.2.132. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14626

This column could probably benefit from some maximum-width settings and perhaps word-wrapping hints. * I miss the start-time column on the batches list page, which gave an idea of which batches are recent and which are from last week etc. (There'd be alternatives to adding a column to convey this information — e.g., there could be subheading rows in the table saying “Yesterday”, …, “Monday July 15th”, etc.). * On the job page the entry labeled Pending is actually the total of pending and running jobs, which is a bit misleading. ### Version. 0.2.132. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14628

Technical:; - [X] Are there any CSS conventions within Hail? I assume I need to migrate the ad-hoc ""style"" tags into CSS?; - [X] There still seems to be a bunch of unused space after truncated batch names. I'm not sure why.
