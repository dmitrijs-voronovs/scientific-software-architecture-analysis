The key new rules are:; ```css; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(130px, 1fr));; width: 100%;; ```; The first rule tells the browser to put as many columns in the grid as possible, except that:; 1. no column may be less than 130px (approximately the length of the phrase ""Hail Query""); 2. no column may occupy more than one ""fraction"" of the horizontal space (which is to say: each column gets an equal portion of the horizontal space). The second rule tells the browser how much space is available for the grid.

The only things that are not shifting code into different modules and invoking those modules are:. - Made the default AKS node pool the nonpreemptible pool instead of having two custom pools in addition to default; - Added subscription/resource group level roles to be added to the service_principal module which removed a fair amount of repetitive role blocks.; - The azure module directly invokes Kubernetes resources instead of managing two separate states (one for azure and one for k8s). This simplifies the process to one `terraform apply` instead of two and removes the need for the janky copying of outputs to inputs that happened in bootstrap.sh.

When you call `collect`, the Python-side `ServiceBackend` writes a file to cloud storage containing; the temporary directory, billing project, and the IR. In addition to the `execute` command used for; `collect`, there are command for getting the table type and references; genomes. `ServiceBackend._rpc` defines this API on the Python-side and; `is.hail.backend.service.ServiceBackendSocketAPI2` defines this API on the Scala-side. After writing to cloud storage, the ServiceBackend submits the one-job driver batch to Hail; Batch. It then waits for the driver job to complete. When the driver job is finished, it reads the; outputs from google cloud storage and returns the results to the user. All the meaningful changes to batch are in the worker. The worker starts one jvm per core on; startup. The mainclass is a new class called `JVMEntryway`. This entryway starts a UNIX socket and; speaks a very simple binary protocol. It accepts only one type of message:. ```; int32 the number of strings to expect; (; int32 the number of bytes in the next string; byte* UTF-8 string; )*; ```. The array of strings is interpreted as:. ```; comma-spearated-classpath; main-class-name; arg0; arg1; ...; ```. The entryway constructs a URLClassLoader with the given classpath, reflectively allocates an; instance of the mainclass and invokes the `main` method with the remaining arguments. This is; obviously a security risk. The system bans JARs from locations not controlled (and locked down) by; Hail Team. You should require me to hardcode the mainclass as; `is.hail.backend.service.ServiceBackendSocketAPI2` before we merge; however, this flexibility was; useful during development. The JVMEntryway will eventually be useful because we will keep a ClassLoader full of a bunch of; JIT-optimized Hail classes.

Jobs can still communicate with themselves within their own network namespace (localhost still works fine), and we strictly prohibit workers talking to each other, so I don't see any reason why we shouldn't go the public ip approach. # Commit 2; This gives the external ip address to a job container that opens a port instead of using the private one. This just seems to make more sense to me and also allows us to delete that iptables rule.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11250:1366,Testability,test,test,1366,"# Commit 1. This rule that we add per job network namespace. > iptables -w {IPTABLES_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS} --append FORWARD --out-interface {self.veth_host} --in-interface {self.internet_interface} --jump ACCEPT. is functionally equivalent to this single line . > iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface $INTERNET_INTERFACE --destination 172.20.0.0/15 --jump ACCEPT. so better have 1 rule than O(slots) rules. It would be nice to eliminate the one remaining rule that we append per-network namespace. Without that rule [this test](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/9da1c759efe9fcbbd9ad02ee7c8bf725974270e9/batch/test/test_dag.py#L117) will fail because the iptables rules won't allow `curl $HAIL_BATCH_WORKER_IP:$HAIL_BATCH_WORKER_PORT` from inside the job container. The request leaves the job's network namespace to the host (whose IP it is), and then returns right back to the network namespace. I have this strict rule such that jobs cannot communicate with each other, but so far don't know how in iptables to specify that the sending/receiving interfaces or IPs must match without listing them explicitly.

I learned early that the issue was somehow related to method splitting, but it was far more devious than I expected, and the code in LIR method splitting is completely correct.

These should have written the byte. 1<<0 | 1<<1 | 0<<2 | 0<<3; ==> b00000011; ==> 3. But instead wrote the byte `b00000001 or 1`, incorrectly leading readers to try to read field B when it was missing (and not written). This is due to the load-bearing and incorrect type of an I2B instruction generated [here](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/8bd9b7b2224b77372a72f02f2b13806267892a35/hail/src/main/scala/is/hail/types/encoded/EBaseStruct.scala#L107). I2B is an instruction that truncates an integer to a byte, and it is used in various places in code generation but primarily encoding missing bits in arrays and structs. . I2B loads a byte to the stack, not a boolean. TypeInfos are mostly non-structural since they rarely influence the bytecode generated.

This is due to the load-bearing and incorrect type of an I2B instruction generated [here](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/8bd9b7b2224b77372a72f02f2b13806267892a35/hail/src/main/scala/is/hail/types/encoded/EBaseStruct.scala#L107). I2B is an instruction that truncates an integer to a byte, and it is used in various places in code generation but primarily encoding missing bits in arrays and structs. . I2B loads a byte to the stack, not a boolean. TypeInfos are mostly non-structural since they rarely influence the bytecode generated.

I learned early that the issue was somehow related to method splitting, but it was far more devious than I expected, and the code in LIR method splitting is completely correct. The particular case I was debugging had expected behavior when trying to write the missing bits of four fields A,B,C,D, where A and B were missing and C and D were present. These should have written the byte. 1<<0 | 1<<1 | 0<<2 | 0<<3; ==> b00000011; ==> 3. But instead wrote the byte `b00000001 or 1`, incorrectly leading readers to try to read field B when it was missing (and not written). This is due to the load-bearing and incorrect type of an I2B instruction generated [here](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/8bd9b7b2224b77372a72f02f2b13806267892a35/hail/src/main/scala/is/hail/types/encoded/EBaseStruct.scala#L107). I2B is an instruction that truncates an integer to a byte, and it is used in various places in code generation but primarily encoding missing bits in arrays and structs. . I2B loads a byte to the stack, not a boolean. TypeInfos are mostly non-structural since they rarely influence the bytecode generated. Here is an exception, and that's where the method splitter comes in. Method splitting exists in the Hail compiler because not only does the JVM have limits on how large methods can be, but also the JIT compiler handles small methods much more effectively than large methods (and so splitting a large method into two small ones can make an order of magnitude or more in performance difference). We have three forms of method splitting in the Hail Query compiler. The first is a heuristic and greedy IR-level method splitter that generates new methods every X IR nodes, simply based on node count. However, the size of code generated by each IR can vary widely (`I32` vs `LowerBoundOnOrderedCollection` for instance), and so we have two other kinds of splitting that operate on the LIR level.

The first is region splitting, which is used to split large blocks of LIR. In order to insert a split, any variables on the stack are stored in local variables before the split and loaded from those locals after the split. The second is method splitting, which is used to split large single methods. A single-exit group of blocks can be split into a separate method, and we have some machinery for replacing control flow instructions (which I will not go into here, for they are not relevant now), as well as handling local variables that are used across a method split. These shared Local variables are replaced by fields on a ""spills"" class which is allocated any time a split method is called.

So now I group by discrete values and collect them as globals, and I get one pandas dataframe per group of discrete values. This makes things a bit less complicated I think. . As part of this change, I now create scales based on looking at all the collected data, not just one particular geom's data. This is more correct for things like continuous color, where if I have one geom that has points in color range 0 - .5, and another geom that has points in color range .5-1, there should be a continuous color gradient between 0 and 1, not two separate ones from 0 - .5 and .5 - 1. . This will also allow me to support things like `scale_color_hue`, which is the default R way of picking discrete colors by choosing evenly spaced points on a color wheel. I can't pick evenly spaced points if I don't know how many discrete values of `color` I have across all geoms. Summary of actual code changes:. 1. Don't flatten out grouped data. Stats use `group_by` to group by discrete aesthetics, but prior to this PR they would just forget that grouping information and flatten out the data, only to redetermine the grouping information later. This prevents that entirely by storing the per group information in a dataframes `attrs`. ; 2. Update geoms to reflect they are getting data in this form. This simplifies away the need to have a specified `take_one` boolean for each aesthetic a geom supports that said whether it's a per data point or per group field.; 3.

The Container class has all the code for setting up networks, ports, overlays, and running the container. The two important public methods are `run` and `get_logs` which subclasses can overwrite. The Task class is a subclass of the Container class. In the future I will add `JVMContainer` which is also a subclass of a Container. There is an open question about what the code is doing with `spec['network']` right now. The validator says it's an optional string, but our code allows booleans and doesn't handle the 'public' case.

Now take a look at the worker: It takes us about nine seconds to get to; an initialized FileStore. Maybe FS creation is really slow? We create one; twice in activate. I think we might initialize credentials three times. I; will fix these in a future PR. The main issue, though, is that the driver *immediately* provides us with; work after we activate, but we are not yet ready for work. I suspect aiohttp; was ready at about 19:05:33 worker time because that's when we see the; image cleanup loop start running. The worker times out and kills itself before; the driver initiates another scheduling loop.
