Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emp",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html

Parallel Computing; We use OpenMP to run multiple threads for parallel computing.; Do not use pthreads or std::thread.; The standard pattern for doing anything with OpenMP looks something like this:; // Declare only thread-safe stuff here; #pragma omp parallel; {; // PER THREAD VARIABLE DECLARATION; unsigned int threadIdx = 0;; #ifdef OPENMP; threadIdx = (unsigned int) omp_get_thread_num();; #endif. // somtimes you want schedule(static); #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic, 1); for (...) {; // DO YOUR WORK; }; // CLEAN UP MEMORY IF NECCECARY; }.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

Continuous integration runs with -Werror and will fail when it finds any warnings.; Since, the CI system runs on many compilers and compiler versions the kind of warnings reported might differ between your local environment and the CI>; Shellcheck; Shellcheck runs on all workflow shell scripts and will fail in the continuous integration if it finds any issues.; Make sure to not use Bash specific features. #!/bin/sh means that are POSIX shell compliant.; The MMseqs2 Windows builds run with the busybox ash shell, if you are a bit careful about your scripts, you will automatically gain Windows support.; Regression test; The regression test runs most workflows (search, profile search, profile-profile, target-profile, clustering, linclust, etc.) after every commit.; It compares their results against known good ones and fails if they don't match.; To run the regression test suite execute the following steps:; git submodule update --init; ./util/regression/run_regression.sh full-path-to-mmseqs-binary intermediate-files-scratch-directory. It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints.

Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if it's clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typical",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file.

This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan ..

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code).

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true. Add a custom footer; . . .

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html

However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html

The error code can be checked with ""echo $?"". ; $ [ $? -eq 1 ] && echo ""Error"". It will print a report with sensitivity AUCs it achieved and then error out if it did not achieve the minimum AUCs. Currently 0.235 for normal sequence searches and 0.331 for profile searches.; You can also use our Docker images to run this benchmark:; cd mmseqs-folder; docker build -t mmseqs2 .; git clone https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark.git; cd mmseqs-benchmark; docker build -t mmseqs-benchmark . The regression test passed, if the second image exits cleanly.; Please note, some users don't have permissions to access the unix socket to communicate with the Docker engine.; In such a case, run the commands above as ""sudo docker build ...""; The script that runs the regression test is found here:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/scripts/run_codeship_pipeline.sh; There is also a docker image that runs the regression test:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/Dockerfile; Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan ... Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true. Add a custom footer; . . .

Try to avoid #pragma omp critical and #pragma omp atomic. Consider using atomic instructions instead (e.g. __sync_fetch_and_add).; Advice on memory allocation; Allocate memory as early as possible. Try not to allocate memory on the heap inside your hot loops:; #pragma omp parallel; {; // try to allocate once here; char MEMORY[1024 * 1024 * 1024];; // also for containers; std::vector<int> results;; results.reserve(1024);; #pragma omp for schedule(static); for (...) {; // not here; }. C++ Standards; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes std::map (careful!).; However, weights any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they are extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(); s.clear();); smart pointer (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful. std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);.

C++ Standards; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes std::map (careful!).; However, weights any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they are extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(); s.clear();); smart pointer (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful. std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""search"", search, &",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html

Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. General naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are ",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html

C++ Standards; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes std::map (careful!).; However, weights any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they are extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(); s.clear();); smart pointer (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful. std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""search"", search, &",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html

Before commiting code; Compiler warnings; Do not leave any compiler warnings in your code. Most of the time they might be false positives.; However, sometimes they hide real issues. Continous integration runs with -Werror and will fail when it finds any warnings.; Since, the CI system runs on many compilers and compiler versions the kinf of warnigs reported might differ between your local environment and the CI>; Shellcheck; (Shellcheck)[https://www.shellcheck.net] runs on all workflow shell scripts and will fail in the continous integration if it finds any issues.; Make sure to not use Bash specific features. #!/bin/sh means that are POSIX shell compliant.; The MMseqs2 Windows builds run with the busybox ash shell, if you are a bit careful about your scripts, you will automatically gain Windows support.; Regression test; The regression test runs most workflows such as search, profile search, profile-profile, target-profile, clustering, linclustm etc. after every commit.; It compares their values against known good ones and fails if they don't match.; Test your code before commiting code by using the regression test:; https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki#regression-test; The script that runs the regression test is found here:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/scripts/run_codeship_pipeline.sh; There is also a docker image that runs the regression test:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/Dockerfile.

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if it's clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typical",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

Parallel Computing; We use OpenMP to run multiple threads for parallel computing.; Do not use pthreads or std::thread.; The standard pattern for doing anything with OpenMP looks something like this:; // Declare only thread-safe stuff here; #pragma omp parallel; {; // PER THREAD VARIABLE DECLARATION; unsigned int threadIdx = 0;; #ifdef OPENMP; threadIdx = (unsigned int) omp_get_thread_num();; #endif. // sometimes you want schedule(static); #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic, 1); for (...) {; // DO YOUR WORK; }; // CLEAN UP MEMORY IF NECESSARY; }.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emp",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html

Parallel Computing; We use OpenMP to run multiple threads for parallel computing.; Do not use pthreads or std::thread.; The standard pattern for doing anything with OpenMP looks something like this:; // Declare only thread-safe stuff here; #pragma omp parallel; {; // PER THREAD VARIABLE DECLARATION; unsigned int threadIdx = 0;; #ifdef OPENMP; threadIdx = (unsigned int) omp_get_thread_num();; #endif. // somtimes you want schedule(static); #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic, 1); for (...) {; // DO YOUR WORK; }; // CLEAN UP MEMORY IF NECCECARY; }.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html

The error code can be checked with ""echo $?"". ; $ [ $? -eq 1 ] && echo ""Error"". It will print a report with sensitivity AUCs it achieved and then error out if it did not achieve the minimum AUCs. Currently 0.235 for normal sequence searches and 0.331 for profile searches.; You can also use our Docker images to run this benchmark:; cd mmseqs-folder; docker build -t mmseqs2 .; git clone https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark.git; cd mmseqs-benchmark; docker build -t mmseqs-benchmark . The regression test passed, if the second image exits cleanly.; Please note, some users don't have permissions to access the unix socket to communicate with the Docker engine.; In such a case, run the commands above as ""sudo docker build ...""; The script that runs the regression test is found here:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/scripts/run_codeship_pipeline.sh; There is also a docker image that runs the regression test:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/Dockerfile; Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html

However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.; Example: computedValues or index; Local variable names; Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, ",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html

Before commiting code; Compiler warnings; Do not leave any compiler warnings in your code. Most of the time they might be false positives.; However, sometimes they hide real issues. Continous integration runs with -Werror and will fail when it finds any warnings.; Since, the CI system runs on many compilers and compiler versions the kinf of warnigs reported might differ between your local environment and the CI>; Shellcheck; (Shellcheck)[https://www.shellcheck.net] runs on all workflow shell scripts and will fail in the continous integration if it finds any issues.; Make sure to not use Bash specific features. #!/bin/sh means that are POSIX shell compliant.; The MMseqs2 Windows builds run with the busybox ash shell, if you are a bit careful about your scripts, you will automatically gain Windows support.; Regression test; The regression test runs most workflows such as search, profile search, profile-profile, target-profile, clustering, linclustm etc. after every commit.; It compares their values against known good ones and fails if they don't match.; Test your code before commiting code by using the regression test:; https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki#regression-test; The script that runs the regression test is found here:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/scripts/run_codeship_pipeline.sh; There is also a docker image that runs the regression test:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/Dockerfile.

This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/f6c8236d89eb5db6b0bee7074b54bcbca12e68d4.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/f6c8236d89eb5db6b0bee7074b54bcbca12e68d4.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/f6c8236d89eb5db6b0bee7074b54bcbca12e68d4.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/f6c8236d89eb5db6b0bee7074b54bcbca12e68d4.html

Before commiting code; Compiler warnings; Do not leave any compiler warnings in your code. Most of the time they might be false positives.; However, sometimes they hide real issues. Continous integration runs with -Werror and will fail when it finds any warnings.; Since, the CI system runs on many compilers and compiler versions the kinf of warnigs reported might differ between your local environment and the CI>; Shellcheck; (Shellcheck)[https://www.shellcheck.net] runs on all workflow shell scripts and will fail in the continous integration if it finds any issues.; Make sure to not use Bash specific features. #!/bin/sh means that are POSIX shell compliant.; The MMseqs2 Windows builds run with the busybox ash shell, if you are a bit careful about your scripts, you will automatically gain Windows support.; Regression test; The regression test runs most workflows such as search, profile search, profile-profile, target-profile, clustering, linclustm etc. after every commit.; It compares their values against known good ones and fails if they don't match.; Test your code before commiting code by using the regression test:; https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki#regression-test; The script that runs the regression test is found here:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/scripts/run_codeship_pipeline.sh; There is also a docker image that runs the regression test:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/Dockerfile.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels.

Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens.
