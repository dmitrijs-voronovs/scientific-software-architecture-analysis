Last commit moves the check to `TRint` and also now checks if there are multiple unrecognized options issued by the user:. ```; $ root --random -z --nonexistingoption; root: unrecognized option '--random'; root: unrecognized option '-z'; root: unrecognized option '--nonexistingoption'; Try 'root --help' for more information.; ```.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8873#issuecomment-2043899538:614,Availability,mainten,maintenance,614,"Since the differences to my [original repo](https://github.com/guitargeek/tmva-to-xgboost/blob/main/tmva2xgboost.cpp) are minimal, I think we don't lose much by closing this PR in order to clean up the list of open PRs a little bit. I don't think there is much of a usecase either: the TMVA xml format for BDTs is becoming increasingly rare, and in any case it can already be evaluated with ROOT. Also, I don't really see why ROOT needs yet another intermediate BDT representation. Is the existing TMVA BDT evaluator that reads the XML files not good enough? Before introducing new data classes and increasing the maintenance burden even more, why not bring the existing classes up to speed (although I think the usecase is not strong enough to actually to this).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8873#issuecomment-2043899538

I have addressed most of your comments and tried to justify whenever I didn't do something, which was mostly because I think it should be done in separate PRs (new tutorial, removing dependecy of RooFitCore tests on RooFit). I think this PR implements now all the functionality requested by @will-cern in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8123, so it would be good if you Will could confirm this. In a later PR, I'm then going to implement what was not required to solve the issue but what is still useful for ROOT nonetheless (also mentioned in the PR description):; 1. make it possible to specify the global observables when generating a dataset:; `model.generate(x, 1000, GlobalObservables(g))`; 2. make it possible to also sample global observable values when generating a toy dataset:; `model.generate({x, g}, 1000, GlobalObservables(g))`; 3.
