This improves the service backend to also support Python-style globbing. The strategy is straightforward:; 1. Break the object name into components (the bits between `/`s); 2. Find the components with glob patterns. Call these pattern-components.; 3. For each pattern-component, list the files in its `dirname`. Find entries which match the pattern-component. cc: @tpoterba @chrisvittal , y'all have a vested interest in the Query Python FS API.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11626
