https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13253:557,Availability,down,down,557,"Qin He reported that listing a folder containing around 50k files took 1h15. This new code takes ~16 seconds which is about how long it takes `gcloud storage ls`. There are two improvements:. 1. Use `bounded_gather2`. The use of a semaphore in `bounded_gather2`, which is missing from `bounded_gather`, allows it to be used recursively. In particular, suppose we had a semaphore of; 50. The outer `bounded_gather2` might need 20 slots to run its 20 paths in parallel. That leaves 30 slots of parallelism left over for its children. By passing the semaphore down, we let our children optimistically use some of that excess parallelism. 2. If we happen to have the `StatResult` for a particular object, we should never again look it up. In particular, getting the `StatResult` for every file in a directory can be done in O(1) requests. Getting the `StatResult` for each of those files individually (using their full paths) is necessarily O(N). If there was at least one glob and also there are no `suffix_components`, then we can use the `StatResult`s that we learned when checking the glog pattern. The latter point is perhaps a bit more clear with examples:. 1. `gs://foo/bar/baz`. Since there are no globs, we can make exactly one API request to list `gs://foo/bar/baz`. 2. `gs://foo/b*r/baz`. In this case, we must make one API request to list `gs://foo/`. This gives us a list of paths under that prefix. We check each path for conformance to the glob pattern `gs://foo/b*r`. For any path that matches, we must then list `<the matching path>/baz` which may itself be a directory containing files. Overall we make O(1) API requests to do the glob and then O(K) API requests to get the final `StatResult`s, where K is the number of paths matching the glob pattern. 3. `gs://foo/bar/b*z`.

Ben submitted a pipeline where the first 85% of jobs run in us-central1 while the last 15% run in us-east1. The autoscaler only looks at the head of the job queue and then sorts the result set to figure out the regions to spin up instances in. The scheduler looks at the entire job queue and then sorts the result set to figure out the regions to spin up instances in. The sort order placed us-east1 before us-central1. Concretely, the autoscaler is spinning up instances in us-central1 only while the scheduler is trying to schedule jobs in us-east1.

However, both us and Microsoft couldn't get VMs to last more than 50 minutes before being evicted. #13252 was an attempt to address this issue by being able to bid for VMs at a higher price than the hardware price. However, before I finished work on this feature, the billing rates in Azure changed (July 18th) and this no longer seems to be an issue.

The `AuthClient` decorators are used by services like Batch and CI to protect endpoints behind an authentication/authorization check. Those decorators might make a network request to the auth service to see who the user is and whether they're a developer. I realized that these decorators are also used to protect some endpoints on the auth service too, which albeit uniform felt silly to me (make a network request back to yourself instead of just making a function call). Creating new decorators to use within the auth service is a bit more code, but I personally think it's a much easier code path to follow.

A test case of ours (see populationgenomics/production-pipelines#424) newly abends with Hail 0.2.120. In essence, the relevant code does. ```python; combiner = hl.vds.new_combiner(; gvcf_paths=[…a bunch of gvcf_paths…],; output_path=str(vds_path),; […etc…]; ) ; combiner.run(). vds = hl.vds.read_vds(str(vds_path)); vds = hl.vds.split_multi(vds, filter_changed_loci=True); ```. This raises an exception within `split_multi()`:. ```; AttributeError: 'StringExpression' object has no attribute 'is_non_ref'; ```. As can be seen from the full log, this exception occurs when _hail/python/hail/experimental/sparse_mt/sparse_split_multi.py_'s `transform_entries()` looks at the LPGT entry and tries to use a `CallExpression` method on it. Tracing the vds through the combiner code, we can see that the returned data structure lists the LPGT entry as `str` rather than `call` as in Hail 0.2.119:. ```; ----------------------------------------; Global fields:; None; ----------------------------------------; Column fields:; 's': str; ----------------------------------------; Row fields:; 'locus': locus<GRCh38>; 'alleles': array<str>; 'rsid': str; ----------------------------------------; Entry fields:; 'LA': array<int32>; 'LGT': call; 'LAD': array<int32>; 'LPGT': str # BROKEN, should be ""call""; 'LPL': array<int32>; 'RGQ': int32; 'gvcf_info': struct {; […etc…]; ```. Hence the problem appears to be in the combining and I suspect may have been caused by PR #13206.
