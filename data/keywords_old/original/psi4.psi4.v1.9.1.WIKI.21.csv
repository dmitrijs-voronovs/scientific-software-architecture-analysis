Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge.

Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy with Psithon¶; Finally, let’s consider an example that shows how the Python driver; in PSI4 simplifies some routine tasks. PSI4 can interpret; valid Python code in addition to the computational chemistry directives; we’ve seen in the previous examples; we call this mixture Psithon.; The Python computer language is very easy to pick up, and even users; previously unfamiliar with Python can use it to simplify tasks by; modifying some of the example input files supplied with PSI4; in the psi4/samples directory.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B.

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20# Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; unit",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial-1.html

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting.

If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]. So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20# Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial-1.html

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array.

This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; 1>>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory. Running a Basic Hartree–Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree–Fock SCF computation; for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. We will specify the; geometry of our water molecule using a standard Z-matrix.; # Any line starting with the # character is a comment line; #!

Any user options need to; be set before the procedure they are meant to affect. For your convenience, the above example can be found in; tu1-h2o-energy.; You can run it if you wish.; Once PSI4 is in your path (see the; User Configuration; section of the installation instructions), you can run this computation by typing; 1>>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; 1; 2; 3Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that PSI4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree–Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with freeze_core True.

Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #! Optimize H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'). This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial.html

However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm-1; may exist):; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7 Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6480; A1 4113.3794; B2 4212.1826; -----------------------------------------------.

The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]. So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; 1>>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples.

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers. Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy with Psithon¶; Finally, let’s consider an example that shows how the Python driver; in PSI4 simplifies some routine tasks. PSI4 can interpret; valid Python code in addition to the computational chemistry directives; we’ve seen in the previous examples; we call this mixture Psithon.; The Python computer language is very easy to pick up, and even users; previously unfamiliar with Python can use it to simplify tasks by; modifying some of the example input files supplied with PSI4; in the psi4/samples directory.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; L",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial.html

Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF).

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20# Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; unit",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/tutorial.html

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #!

Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D\(_n\)) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as \({\cal O}(N^5)\). In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; The ADC code makes use of the libtrans library for efficient and flexible; integral-transformation and also the libdpd library to; utilize molecular symmetry in the",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/adc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/adc.html

For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed.

With -1, -2, and -3, the user might request strict freezing of the previous first/second/third noble gas shell on every atom. In this case, when there are no valence electrons, the code raises an exception.

For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian.

SYM_CHECK=OVERRIDE (=1) doesn’t. The latter is the default. Type: boolean; Default: true. CFOUR_SYMMETRY (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies what subgroup of the full point group is to be used in the energy and/or gradient calculation (the computational point group). OFF (=1) forces a no symmetry run (in \(C_1\) ) and ON (=0) runs the calculation in the largest self-adjoint subgroup ( \(D_{2h}\) and its subgroups). Type: boolean; Default: true. CFOUR_T3_EXTRAPOL (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether the T3 amplitudes are included ON (=1) or not included OFF (=0) in the DIIS convergence acceleration during CCSDT calculations. Inclusion of T3 speeds up convergence and allows tight convergence, but on the other hand it increases disk space requirements. Note that this keyword is only available with module xecc. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_TAMP_SUM (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies how often the largest \(t\) amplitudes are to be printed. For =0, amplitudes are printed at the beginning and end of the run.

Type: boolean; Default: true. CFOUR_VIBRATION (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether (harmonic) vibrational frequencies are calculated or not. If the default NO (=0) is specified then no frequencies are calculated. For ANALYTIC, vibrational frequencies are determined from analytically computed second derivatives, and for FINDIF (=2) vibrational frequencies are calculated from a force field obtained by numerical differentiation of analytically evaluated gradients (or even single-point energies) using symmetry-adapted mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates. If vibrational frequencies are calculated, a normal mode analysis using the computed force-constant matrix is performed, rotationally projected frequencies are computed, infrared intensities are determined, and zero-point energies (ZPE) are evaluated. Type: string; Possible Values: NO, ANALYTIC, FINDIF, EXACT; Default: NO. CFOUR_VTRAN (CFOUR); CFOUR — This keyword defines what type of integral transformation is to be performed in the program xvtran. FULL/PARTIAL (=0) allows the transformation program to choose the appropriate type of transformation, while FULL (=1) requires a full integral transformation and PARTIAL (=2) means a MBPT(2)-specific transformation where the \((ab \vert cd)\) integrals are not formed.

For example, specifying CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL =2/-4, QRHF_ORBITAL=3/2 means that an electron will be added to the third lowest virtual in symmetry block 2 and another will be removed from the second highest occupied orbital in symmetry block 4. Examples given later in this manual further illustrate the QRHF input options and may help to clarify any confusion resulting from this documentation. (Default : 1). Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR); CFOUR — If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false.

OFF (= 0) The relaxed density will not be computed, ON (= 1) it will be computed. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RES_RAMAN (CFOUR); CFOUR — This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates. A warning message is printed if the force constant matrix is unavailable. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RESTART_CC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Offers the possibility to restart a CC calculation which stopped for various reasons, e.g. time limit, in the correlation part. However, note that a restart which is specified by ON (= 1) needs the following files of the previous unfinished calculation: JOBARC, JAINDX, MOINTS, and MOABCD. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_ROT_EVEC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies which eigenvector of the orbital rotation Hessian is to be used to rotate the original SCF orbitals. By default, it will use that associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the totally symmetric part of the block-factored Hessian, as this choice often leads to the lowest energy SCF solution. For RHF stability checks, only those instabilities which correspond to RHF solutions will be considered.

A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates. A warning message is printed if the force constant matrix is unavailable. Type: boolean; Default: false.

CFOUR_ROT_EVEC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies which eigenvector of the orbital rotation Hessian is to be used to rotate the original SCF orbitals. By default, it will use that associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the totally symmetric part of the block-factored Hessian, as this choice often leads to the lowest energy SCF solution.

The occupancy is specified by either NIRREP or 2*NIRREP integers specifying the number of occupied orbitals of each symmetry type, where NIRREP is the number of irreducible representations in the computational point group. If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. If the reference function is for an open-shell system, two strings of NIRREP occupation numbers separated by a slash are input for the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) sets of orbitals. An example of the use of the OCCUPATION keyword for the water molecule would be OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0. For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed.

IJ_CANONICAL requests a canonical perturbed-orbital treatment only for the occupied-occupied block of the unperturbed density matrix in analytic derivative calculations. For testing purposes, it is possible to force the use standard perturbed orbitals even in case of iterative triple excitations via the option FORCE_STANDA (dne?). Note also that in case of unrelaxed derivatives standard orbitals must be used.

CFOUR_ANH_ALGORITHM (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies which algorithm is used for CFOUR_ANHARMONIC =VIBROT, VPT2, and FULLQUARTIC calculations.

For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF. Type: string; Possible Values: OFF, EXPECTATION, UNRELAXED, RESPONSE; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ESTATE_SYM (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the number of excited states which are to be determined in each irreducible representation of the computational subgroup. The program attempts to find all of the lowest roots, but this is not guaranteed because the eigenvalue problem is not solved by direct matrix diagonalization, but rather by an iterative (modified Davidson) algorithm. For excited state gradient calculations, only one root (clearly) is used. In such a case, one and only one non-zero entry in the string can be used, and this value is usually set to one (i.e. 0/1/0/0). (However sometimes one wants to calculate the gradient for, say, the second root of a given symmetry, and in such a case, one could use 0/2/0/0. What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in CFOUR_OCCUPATION. For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the %excite* input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros.

CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR); CFOUR — If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false.

It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed.

This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry.

CFOUR_RES_RAMAN (CFOUR); CFOUR — This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates.

The purpose of the QRHF_ORBITAL keyword is to allow additional flexibility in choosing which orbitals will have their occupation numbers altered. The value of this keyword gives the offset with respect to the default orbital for the orbital which will be depopulated (or populated) in QRHF-CC calculations. For calculations involving more than one removal or addition of electrons, values are separated by commas and correspond to the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL input on a one-to-one basis.

For example, specifying CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL =2/-4, QRHF_ORBITAL=3/2 means that an electron will be added to the third lowest virtual in symmetry block 2 and another will be removed from the second highest occupied orbital in symmetry block 4. Examples given later in this manual further illustrate the QRHF input options and may help to clarify any confusion resulting from this documentation. (Default : 1). Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR); CFOUR — If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword.

CFOUR_RES_RAMAN (CFOUR); CFOUR — This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates. A warning message is printed if the force constant matrix is unavailable. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RESTART_CC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Offers the possibility to restart a CC calculation which stopped for various reasons, e.g. time limit, in the correlation part.

CFOUR_ROT_EVEC (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies which eigenvector of the orbital rotation Hessian is to be used to rotate the original SCF orbitals. By default, it will use that associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the totally symmetric part of the block-factored Hessian, as this choice often leads to the lowest energy SCF solution.

CFOUR_OCCUPATION (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the orbital occupancy of the reference function in terms of the occupation numbers of the orbitals and their irreducible representations. The occupancy is specified by either NIRREP or 2*NIRREP integers specifying the number of occupied orbitals of each symmetry type, where NIRREP is the number of irreducible representations in the computational point group. If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. If the reference function is for an open-shell system, two strings of NIRREP occupation numbers separated by a slash are input for the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) sets of orbitals. An example of the use of the OCCUPATION keyword for the water molecule would be OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0. For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed.

STANDARD means that the gradient formulation assumes that the perturbed orbitals are not those in which the (perturbed) Fock matrix is diagonal. CANONICAL means that the perturbed orbitals are assumed to be canonical. This keyword is set automatically to CANONICAL in derivative calculations with methods which include triple excitations (MBPT[4]/MP4, CCSD+T[CCSD], CCSD[T], QCISD[T] and all iterative schemes like CCSDT-n and CC3) apart from CCSDT. IJ_CANONICAL requests a canonical perturbed-orbital treatment only for the occupied-occupied block of the unperturbed density matrix in analytic derivative calculations. For testing purposes, it is possible to force the use standard perturbed orbitals even in case of iterative triple excitations via the option FORCE_STANDA (dne?). Note also that in case of unrelaxed derivatives standard orbitals must be used.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html:36489,Usability,clear,clearly,36489,"yword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF. Type: string; Possible Values: OFF, EXPECTATION, UNRELAXED, RESPONSE; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ESTATE_SYM (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies the number of excited states which are to be determined in each irreducible representation of the computational subgroup. The program attempts to find all of the lowest roots, but this is not guaranteed because the eigenvalue problem is not solved by direct matrix diagonalization, but rather by an iterative (modified Davidson) algorithm. For excited state gradient calculations, only one root (clearly) is used. In such a case, one and only one non-zero entry in the string can be used, and this value is usually set to one (i.e. 0/1/0/0). (However sometimes one wants to calculate the gradient for, say, the second root of a given symmetry, and in such a case, one could use 0/2/0/0. What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in CFOUR_OCCUPATION. For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the %excite* input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros. Psi4 Interface: The array above is specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,0,2]. Type: array; Default: No Default.

Examples given later in this manual further illustrate the QRHF input options and may help to clarify any confusion resulting from this documentation. (Default : 1). Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR); CFOUR — If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RAMAN_INT (CFOUR); CFOUR — ON (=1) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the geometrical derivatives of the static polarizability tensor, while DYN (=2) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the derivatives of the dynamical polarizability tensor. Type: string; Possible Values: ON, DYN, OFF; Default: OFF. CFOUR_RAMAN_ORB (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether Raman intensities are calculated with orbital relaxation with respect to the electric field perturbation (RELAXED, = 1) or without orbital relaxation (UNRELAXED, = 0). Type: string; Possible Values: RELAXED, UNRELAXED; Default: UNRELAXED. CFOUR_RDO (CFOUR); CFOUR — Specifies whether or not relaxed density natural orbitals are to be computed. This option only has meaning for a correlated calculation. For =0, Do not compute. For =1, compute. Type: boolean; Default: true.
