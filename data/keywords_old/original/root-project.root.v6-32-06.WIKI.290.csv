Even if you do have the permission, you risk losing the; original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification.; Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the; 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the; original data is erased.; In addition, adding a branch to a tree enlarges the tree and increases; the amount of memory needed to read an entry, and therefore decreases; the performance.

This machine independent version of the data is copied into a; basket (each branch has its own basket). When a basket is full; (32k worth of data by default), it is then optionally compressed; and written to disk (this operation is also called committing or; 'flushing' the basket). The committed baskets are then; immediately removed from memory. The function returns the number of bytes committed to the; individual branches. If a write error occurs, the number of bytes returned is -1. If no data are written, because, e.g., the branch is disabled,; the number of bytes returned is 0. The baskets are flushed and the Tree header saved at regular intervals.

If the result is 0, the histogram is not filled.; In general, the expression may be of the form:; value*(boolean expression); if boolean expression is true, the histogram is filled with; a weight = value.; Examples:; selection1 = ""x<y && sqrt(z)>3.2""; selection2 = ""(x+y)*(sqrt(z)>3.2)""; selection1 returns a weight = 0 or 1; selection2 returns a weight = x+y if sqrt(z)>3.2; returns a weight = 0 otherwise. option is the drawing option.; - See TH1::Draw for the list of all drawing options.; - If option COL is specified when varexp has three fields:; tree.Draw(""e1:e2:e3"","""",""col"");; a 2D scatter is produced with e1 vs e2, and e3 is mapped on the color; table.

This function returns the number of selected entries. It returns -1; if an error occurs. Drawing expressions using arrays and array elements. Let assumes, a leaf fMatrix, on the branch fEvent, which is a 3 by 3 array,; or a TClonesArray.; In a TTree::Draw expression you can now access fMatrix using the following; syntaxes:. String passed What is used for each entry of the tree. ""fMatrix"" the 9 elements of fMatrix; ""fMatrix[][]"" the 9 elements of fMatrix; ""fMatrix[2][2]"" only the elements fMatrix[2][2]; ""fMatrix[1]"" the 3 elements fMatrix[1][0], fMatrix[1][1] and fMatrix[1][2]; ""fMatrix[1][]"" the 3 elements fMatrix[1][0], fMatrix[1][1] and fMatrix[1][2]; ""fMatrix[][0]"" the 3 elements fMatrix[0][0], fMatrix[1][0] and fMatrix[2][0]. ""fEvent.fMatrix...."" same as ""fMatrix..."" (unless there is more than one leaf named fMatrix!). In summary, if a specific index is not specified for a dimension, TTree::Draw; will loop through all the indices along this dimension. Leaving off the; last (right most) dimension of specifying then with the two characters '[]'; is equivalent. For variable size arrays (and TClonesArray) the range; of the first dimension is recalculated for each entry of the tree.; You can also specify the index as an expression of any other variables from the",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html602/TTree.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html602/TTree.html

So the loop equivalent to ""fMatrix[][fResults[][]]"" is:. for (Int_t i0; i0 < 3; i0++) {; for (Int_t j2; j2 < 5; j2++) {; for (Int_t j3; j3 < 2; j3++) {; i1 = fResults[j2][j3];; use the value of fMatrix[i0][i1]; }; }. Retrieving the result of Draw. By default the temporary histogram created is called ""htemp"", but only in; the one dimensional Draw(""e1"") it contains the TTree's data points. For; a two dimensional Draw, the data is filled into a TGraph which is named; ""Graph"". They can be retrieved by calling; TH1F *htemp = (TH1F*)gPad->GetPrimitive(""htemp""); // 1D; TGraph *graph = (TGraph*)gPad->GetPrimitive(""Graph""); // 2D. For a three and four dimensional Draw the TPolyMarker3D is unnamed, and; cannot be retrieved. gPad always contains a TH1 derived object called ""htemp"" which allows to; access the axes:; TGraph *graph = (TGraph*)gPad->GetPrimitive(""Graph""); // 2D; TH2F *htemp = (TH2F*)gPad->GetPrimitive(""htemp""); // empty, but has axes; TAxis *xaxis = htemp->GetXaxis();. Saving the result of Draw to an histogram. If varexp0 contains >>hnew (following the variable(s) name(s),; the new histogram created is called hnew and it is kept in the current; directory (and also the current pad). This works for all dimensions.; Example:; tree.Draw(""sqrt(x)>>hsqrt"",""y>0""); will draw sqrt(x) and save the histogram as ""hsqrt"" in the current; directory. To retrieve it do:; TH1F *hsqrt = (TH1F*)gDirectory->Get(""hsqrt"");. The binning information is taken from the environment variables. Hist.Binning.?D.?. In addition, the name of the histogram can be followed by up to 9; numbers between '(' and ')', where the numbers describe the; following:. 1 - bins in x-direction; 2 - lower limit in x-direction; 3 - upper limit in x-direction; 4-6 same for y-direction; 7-9 same for z-direction.

By default, the specified histogram is reset.; To continue to append data to an existing histogram, use ""+"" in front; of the histogram name.; A '+' in front of the histogram name is ignored, when the name is followed by; binning information as described in the previous paragraph.; tree.Draw(""sqrt(x)>>+hsqrt"",""y>0""); will not reset hsqrt, but will continue filling.; This works for 1-D, 2-D and 3-D histograms. Accessing collection objects. TTree::Draw default's handling of collections is to assume that any; request on a collection pertain to it content. For example, if fTracks; is a collection of Track objects, the following:; tree->Draw(""event.fTracks.fPx"");; will plot the value of fPx for each Track objects inside the collection.; Also; tree->Draw(""event.fTracks.size()"");; would plot the result of the member function Track::size() for each; Track object inside the collection.; To access information about the collection itself, TTree::Draw support; the '@' notation. If a variable which points to a collection is prefixed; or postfixed with '@', the next part of the expression will pertain to; the collection object. For example:; tree->Draw(""event.@fTracks.size()"");; will plot the size of the collection referred to by fTracks (i.e the number; of Track objects). Drawing 'objects'. When a class has a member function named AsDouble or AsString, requesting; to directly draw the object will imply a call to one of the 2 functions.; If both AsDouble and AsString are present, AsDouble will be used.; AsString can return either a char*, a std::string or a TString.s; For example, the following; tree->Draw(""event.myTTimeStamp"");; will draw the same histogram as; tree->Draw(""event.myTTimeStamp.AsDouble()"");; In addition, when the object is a type TString or std::string, TTree::Draw; will call respectively TString::Data and std::string::c_str().

If the object is a TBits, the histogram will contain the index of the bit; that are turned on. Retrieving information about the tree itself. You can refer to the tree (or chain) containing the data by using the; string 'This'.; You can then could any TTree methods. For example:; tree->Draw(""This->GetReadEntry()"");; will display the local entry numbers be read.; tree->Draw(""This->GetUserInfo()->At(0)->GetName()"");; will display the name of the first 'user info' object. Special functions and variables. Entry$: A TTree::Draw formula can use the special variable Entry$; to access the entry number being read. For example to draw every; other entry use:; tree.Draw(""myvar"",""Entry$%2==0"");. Entry$ : return the current entry number (== TTree::GetReadEntry()); LocalEntry$ : return the current entry number in the current tree of a; chain (== GetTree()->GetReadEntry()); Entries$ : return the total number of entries (== TTree::GetEntries()); Length$ : return the total number of element of this formula for this; entry (==TTreeFormula::GetNdata()); Iteration$: return the current iteration over this formula for this; entry (i.e. varies from 0 to Length$). Length$(formula): return the total number of element of the formula given as a; parameter.; Sum$(formula): return the sum of the value of the elements of the formula given; as a parameter. For example the mean for all the elements in; one entry can be calculated with:; Sum$(formula)/Length$(formula); Min$(formula): return the minimun (within one TTree entry) of the value of the; elements of the fo",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html602/TTree.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html602/TTree.html

To visualize a bit more what elements; would be matched by TTree::Draw, TTree::Scan can be used:; tree->Scan(""arr1:Alt$(arr2,0)"");; will print on one line the value of arr1 and (arr2,0) that will be; matched by; tree->Draw(""arr1-Alt$(arr2,0)"");. The ternary operator is not directly supported in TTree::Draw however, to plot the; equivalent of 'var2<20 ? -99 : var1', you can use:; tree->Draw(""(var2<20)*99+(var2>=20)*var1"","""");. Drawing a user function accessing the TTree data directly. If the formula contains a file name, TTree::MakeProxy will be used; to load and execute this file. In particular it will draw the; result of a function with the same name as the file. The function; will be executed in a context where the name of the branches can; be used as a C++ variable. For example draw px using the file hsimple.root (generated by the; hsimple.C tutorial), we need a file named hsimple.cxx:. double hsimple() {; return px;; }.

Long64_t Draw(const char* varexp, const char* selection, Option_t* option = """", Long64_t nentries = 1000000000, Long64_t firstentry = 0); Draw expression varexp for specified entries.; Returns -1 in case of error or number of selected events in case of success. varexp is an expression of the general form; - ""e1"" produces a 1-d histogram (TH1F) of expression ""e1""; - ""e1:e2"" produces an unbinned 2-d scatter-plot (TGraph) of ""e1""; on the y-axis versus ""e2"" on the x-axis; - ""e1:e2:e3"" produces an unbinned 3-d scatter-plot (TPolyMarker3D) of ""e1""; versus ""e2"" versus ""e3"" on the x-, y-, z-axis, respectively.; - ""e1:e2:e3:e4"" produces an unbinned 3-d scatter-plot (TPolyMarker3D) of ""e1""; versus ""e2"" versus ""e3"" and ""e4"" mapped on the color number.; (to create histograms in the 2, 3, and 4 dimensional case, see section ""Saving; the result of Draw to an histogram""). Example:; varexp = x simplest case: draw a 1-Dim distribution of column named x; = sqrt(x) : draw distribution of sqrt(x); = x*y/z; = y:sqrt(x) 2-Dim distribution of y versus sqrt(x); = px:py:pz:2.5*E produces a 3-d scatter-plot of px vs py ps pz; and the color number of each marker will be 2.5*E.; If the color number is negative it is set to 0.; If the color number is greater than the current number of colors; it is set to the highest color number.; The default number of colors is 50.; see TStyle::SetPalette for setting a new color palette. Note that the variables e1, e2 or e3 may contain a selection.; example, if e1= x*(y<0), the value histogrammed will be x if y<0; and will be 0 otherwise.

HOW TO USE the TreeCache. A few use cases are discussed below. A cache may be created with automatic sizing; when a TTree is used:. Caches are created and automatically sized for TTrees when TTreeCache.Size or; the environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE is set to a sizing factor. But there are many possible configurations where manual control may be wanted.; In some applications you know a priori the list of branches to read. In other; applications the analysis loop calls several layers of user functions where it; is impossible to predict a priori which branches will be used. This; is probably the most frequent case. In this case ROOT I/O will flag used; branches automatically when a branch buffer is read during the learning phase.; The TreeCache interface provides functions to instruct the cache about the used; branches if they are known a priori. In the examples below, portions of analysis; code are shown. The few statements involving the TreeCache are marked with //<<<. 1- with TTree::Draw. the TreeCache is automatically used by TTree::Draw. The function knows; which branches are used in the query and it puts automatically these branches; in the cache. The entry range is also known automatically. 2- with TTree::Process and TSelectors. You must enable the cache and tell the system which branches to cache; and also specify the entry range.

HOW TO USE the TreeCache. A few use cases are discussed below. A cache may be created with automatic sizing; when a TTree is used:. Caches are created and automatically sized for TTrees when TTreeCache.Size or; the environment variable ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE is set to a sizing factor. But there are many possible configurations where manual control may be wanted.; In some applications you know a priori the list of branches to read. In other; applications the analysis loop calls several layers of user functions where it; is impossible to predict a priori which branches will be used. This; is probably the most frequent case. In this case ROOT I/O will flag used; branches automatically when a branch buffer is read during the learning phase.; The TreeCache interface provides functions to instruct the cache about the used; branches if they are known a priori. In the examples below, portions of analysis; code are shown. The few statements involving the TreeCache are marked with //<<<. 1- with TTree::Draw. the TreeCache is automatically used by TTree::Draw. The function knows; which branches are used in the query and it puts automatically these branches; in the cache. The entry range is also known automatically. 2- with TTree::Process and TSelectors. You must enable the cache and tell the system which branches to cache; and also specify the entry range. It is important to specify the entry range; in case you process only a subset of the events, otherwise you run the risk; to store in the cache entries that you do not need. --example 2a; --; TTree *T = (TTree*)f->Get(""mytree"");; Long64_t nentries = T->GetEntries();; Int_t cachesize = 10000000; //10 MBytes; T->SetCacheS",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html602/TTreeCache.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html602/TTreeCache.html

Long64_t DrawScript(const char* wrapperPrefix, const char* macrofilename, const char* cutfilename, Option_t* option, Long64_t nentries, Long64_t firstentry); Draw the result of a C++ script. The macrofilename and optionally cutfilename are assumed to contain; at least a method with the same name as the file. The method; should return a value that can be automatically cast to; respectively a double and a boolean. Both methods will be executed in a context such that the; branch names can be used as C++ variables. This is; accomplished by generating a TTreeProxy (see MakeProxy); and including the files in the proper location. If the branch name can not be used a proper C++ symbol name,; it will be modified as follow:; - white spaces are removed; - if the leading character is not a letter, an underscore is inserted; - < and > are replace by underscores; - * is replaced by st; - & is replaced by rf. If a cutfilename is specified, for each entry, we execute; if (cutfilename()) htemp->Fill(macrofilename());; If no cutfilename is specified, for each entry we execute; htemp(macrofilename());.

Int_t MakeCode(const char* filename); Generate skeleton function for this Tree. The function code is written on filename.; If filename is 0, filename will be called nameoftree.C.

The main features of this skeleton are:. * on-demand loading of branches; * ability to use the 'branchname' as if it was a data member; * protection against array out-of-bound; * ability to use the branch data as object (when the user code is available). For example with Event.root, if; Double_t somepx = fTracks.fPx[2];; is executed by one of the method of the skeleton,; somepx will be updated with the current value of fPx of the 3rd track. Both macrofilename and the optional cutfilename are expected to be; the name of source files which contain at least a free standing; function with the signature:; x_t macrofilename(); // i.e function with the same name as the file; and; y_t cutfilename(); // i.e function with the same name as the file. x_t and y_t needs to be types that can convert respectively to a double; and a bool (because the skeleton uses:; if (cutfilename()) htemp->Fill(macrofilename());.

A TEntryList will be; created and applied to the TTree using this criterium.; a new TEntryList to use can be specified using SetEntryList.; TGTable->Update() will need to be called to show the effects. WARNING: Do not apply an entrylist to the tree in any other way than; through the interface, this will have undefined consequences. Columns can be manipulated using the appropriate methods. A; TGTable->Update is always needed afterwards to make the table aware; of the changes.

The method can be applied to a very large number of problems,; where the measured distribution y is a linear superposition; of several Monte Carlo shapes. Input from measurement:. y: vector of measured quantities (dimension ny); Vyy: covariance matrix for y (dimension ny x ny); in many cases V is diagonal and calculated from the errors of y. From simulation:. A: migration matrix (dimension ny x nx). Result. x: unknown underlying distribution (dimension nx); The error matrix of x, V_xx, is also determined. Regularisation. tau: parameter, defining the regularisation strength; L: matrix of regularisation conditions (dimension nl x nx); depends on the structure of the input data; x0: bias distribution, from simulation.

(a) not constrained: minimisation is performed as a function of x; for fixed lambda=0; or; (b) constrained: stationary point is found as a function of x and lambda. The constraint can be useful to reduce biases on the result x; in cases where the vector y follows non-Gaussian probability densities; (example: Poisson statistics at counting experiments in particle physics).

Thus the algorithm should not used for large dimensions of x and y; nx should not be much larger than 200; ny should not be much larger than 1000. Proper choice of tau. One of the difficult questions is about the choice of tau.; The method implemented in TUnfold is the L-curve method:; a two-dimensional curve is plotted; x-axis: log10(chisquare); y-axis: log10(regularisation condition); In many cases this curve has an L-shape. The best choice of tau is in the; kink of the L. Within TUnfold a simple version of the L-curve analysis is available.; It tests a given number of points in a predefined tau-range and searches; for the maximum of the curvature in the L-curve (kink position).; if no tau range is given, the range of the scan is determined automatically. A nice overview of the L-curve method is given in:; The L-curve and Its Use in the Numerical Treatment of Inverse Problems; (2000) by P. C. Hansen, in Computational Inverse Problems in; Electrocardiology, ed. P. Johnston,; Advances in Computational Bioengineering; http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~pch/TR/Lcurve.ps. Alternative Regularisation conditions. Regularisation is needed for most unfolding problems, in order to avoid; large oscillations and large correlations on the output bins.; It means that some extra conditions are applied on the output bins. Within TUnfold these conditions are posed on the difference (x-x0), where; x: unfolding output; x0: the bias distribution, by default calculated from; the input matrix A.

E^-1 = ((A# Vyy^-1 A)+tau^2 Lsquared). x = E (A# Vyy^-1 y + tau^2 Lsquared x0 +lambda/2 * epsilon) is the result. The derivatives; dx_k/dy_i; dx_k/dA_ij; dx_k/d(tau^2); are calculated for further usage. The covariance matrix V_xx is calculated as:; Vxx_ij = sum_kl dx_i/dy_k Vyy_kl dx_j/dy_l. Warning:. The algorithm is based on ""standard"" matrix inversion, with the; known limitations in numerical accuracy and computing cost for; matrices with large dimensions. Thus the algorithm should not used for large dimensions of x and y; nx should not be much larger than 200; ny should not be much larger than 1000. Proper choice of tau. One of the difficult questions is about the choice of tau.; The method implemented in TUnfold is the L-curve method:; a two-dimensional curve is plotted; x-axis: log10(chisquare); y-axis: log10(regularisation condition); In many cases this curve has an L-shape. The best choice of tau is in the; kink of the L. Within TUnfold a simple version of the L-curve analysis is available.; It tests a given number of points in a predefined tau-range and searches; for the maximum of the curvature in the L-curve (kink position).; if no tau range is given, the range of the scan is determined automatically. A nice overview of the L-curve method is given in:; The L-curve and Its Use in the Numerical Treatment of Inverse Problems; (2000) by P. C. Hansen, in Computational Inverse Problems in; Electrocardiology, ed. P. Johnston,; Advances in Computational Bioengineering; http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~pch/TR/Lcurve.ps. Alternative Regularisation conditions. Regularisation is needed for most unfolding problems, in order to avoid; large oscillations and large correlations on the output bins.; It means that some extra conditions are applied on the output bins. Within TUnfold these conditions are posed on the difference (x-x0), where; x: unfolding output; x0: the bias distribution, by default calculated from; the input matrix A.

For each vector there is a tree; structure. The tree nodes hold multi-dimensiopnal distributions. For example, the ""measurement"" tree could have two leaves, one for; the primary distribution and one for auxillary measurements. Similarly, the ""truth"" tree could have two leaves, one for the; signal and one for the background. each of the leaves may then have a multi-dimensional distribution.

In TUnfoldDensity, two methods are implemented to determine tau**2; (1) ScanLcurve() locate the tau where the L-curve plot has a ""kink""; this function is implemented in the TUnfold class; (2) ScanTau() finds the solution such that some variable; (e.g. global correlation coefficient) is minimized; this function is implemented in the TUnfoldDensity class,; such that the variable could be made depend on the binning scheme. Each of the algorithms has its own advantages and disadvantages. The algorithm (1) does not work if the input data are too similar to the; MC prediction, that is unfolding with tau=0 gives a least-square sum; of zero. Typical no-go cases of the L-curve scan are:; (a) the number of measurements is too small (e.g. ny=nx); (b) the input data have no statistical fluctuations; [identical MC events are used to fill the matrix of migrations; and the vector y]. The algorithm (2) only works if the variable does have a real minimum; as a function of tau.; If global correlations are minimized, the situation is as follows:; The matrix of migration typically introduces negative correlations.; The area constraint introduces some positive correlation.; Regularisation on the ""size"" introduces no correlation.; Regularisation on 1st or 2nd derivatives adds positive correlations.; For this reason, ""size"" regularisation",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html602/TUnfoldDensity.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html602/TUnfoldDensity.html

More documentation and updates are available on; http://www.desy.de/~sschmitt. As compared to TUnfold, TUndolfDensity adds the following functionality; * background subtraction (see documentation of TUnfoldSys); * error propagation (see documentation of TUnfoldSys); * regularisation schemes respecting the bin widths; * support for complex, multidimensional input distributions. Complex binning schemes are imposed on the measurements y and; on the result vector x with the help of the class TUnfoldBinning; The components of x or y are part of multi-dimensional distributions.; The bin widths along the relevant directions in these distributions; are used to calculate bin densities (number of events divided by bin width); or to calculate derivatives taking into account the proper distance of; adjacent bin centers. Complex binning schemes. in literature on unfolding, the ""standard"" test case is a; one-dimensional distribution without underflow or overflow bins.; The migration matrix is almost diagonal. This ""standard"" case is rarely realized for real problems. Often one has to deal with multi-dimensional input distributions.; In addition, there are underflow and overflow bins; or other background bins, possibly determined with the help of auxillary; measurements. In TUnfoldDensity, such complex binning schemes are handled with the help; of the class TUnfoldBinning. For each vector there is a tree; structure. The tree nodes hold multi-dimensiopnal distributions. For example, the ""measurement"" tree could have two leaves, one for; the primary distribution and one for auxillary measurements. Similarly, the ""truth"" tree could have two leaves, one for the; signal and one for the background. each of the leaves may then have a multi-dimensional distribution.
