https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8108#issuecomment-833665449:443,Deployability,patch,patch,443,"Are you saying `std::experimental::string_view` is guaranteed to be the same type as `std::string_view`? I seriously doubt that - at least the symbol name should be different, if not even its layout. I bet *some* stdlib has a difference there, somewhere :-). The code you show is fine, but try to call a ROOT function that takes a `string_view` as argument, e.g.; ```c++; std::string_view sv(""bool"");; TClassEdit::STLKind(sv);; ```; Does your patch allow that to compile in C++17, with ROOT built in C++14?

As already mentioned in the other issue, that part of Clang has seen massive changes due to AMD upstreaming their HIP programming model (and fixing quite a number of CUDA issues along the way). The fix for `extern __constant__` is really only https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/b008ea304d438f0aa818918caceb3bd864412304 (but there are many other fixes for problems that you might or might not encounter later on); the reason I mentioned https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/0b2af1a2889423bb797856841ac81cf10d01c696 is that it refactored that part of the code and introduced the functions that are modified for the fix. I tried applying both of them (in chronological order, obviously) and it doesn't work cleanly. I had a quick look at `git log` for only `clang/lib/CodeGen/CGCUDANV.cpp` and found the massive https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/5be9b8cbe2b2253f78a09a863bef18e574737465 that overhauled the registration logic to add support for surfaces and textures. It only appeared in LLVM 11, so we'd either have to backport that as well or re-implement the fix(es) in terms of what is currently there. Moreover, I'm not sure if Clang already knows how to register relocatable `__device__` functions and `extern __constant__` variables or that it needs to invoke `nvlink` to produce an uploadable GPU binary. I didn't implement support for that back then, and I couldn't find in the history that somebody reverse engineered the magic since then. I'm not very familiar with Cling's support for CUDA compilation, but I'd assume that proper support in Clang itself would be a requirement to make it work. Sorry if my current take on the matter sounds a bit disappointing.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8123#issuecomment-838595643:723,Integrability,interface,interface,723,"Thanks. I've had a quick look -- so your approach is to say that the global observables get added to the dataset in the same way you would list your observables, but then you have a way to flag which of the observables are the global ones?. I guess I was imagining instead that the global observables would be truly independent of the observables. So e.g. I would have code like:. ```; RooDataSet ds(""data"",""data"", RooArgSet{a,b,c}, RooFit::GlobalObservables(RooArgSet({x,y,z}));; ds.getGlobals(); // return RooArgSet* to global observables, or null pointer if Dataset has no global observables attached; ds.getGlobals()->setRealValue(""x"",4); // changing the value in the global observables; ```. Do you think that sort of interface will cause problems though?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8123#issuecomment-838595643

Hmm I have to think about that suggestion with the constructor. It would be nice certainly, but adding a parameter to the constructor of an abstract class means usually a lot of code repetition: the parameter would have to be added to most constructors of all child classes (RooDataSet and RooDataHist). Maybe we also need a configuration struct here. Ah right, I missed that! The global observables are usually not even in the columns of the dataset, right? So my assumption that they are a subset of the columns was just plain wrong, no?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8123#issuecomment-838756217

I agree that it's not clear how meaningful `weightError` is for RooDataSet, but still the only two classes that derive from RooAbsData are RooDataHist and RooDataSet. Both of them reimplement `weightError` in a non-trivial way. Or are you thinking about some user classes that might inherit from `RooAbsData`? In that case they would not compile because not all purely virtual functions are implemented. But I'd argue that this a good thing, because then the user is made aware that `weightError` should be implemented with a dummy value. Actually, it can even be dangerous that we choose this dummy value ourselves (why zero and not `nan` for example?).

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8152#issuecomment-849596617:1190,Integrability,wrap,wrapper,1190,"I've been able reproduce this on my desktop (CentOS7, gcc 8.3) when building ROOT from source. The parameter that makes it fail is `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17` (C++ 14 works fine). The reason is: when passing a Python callable as a parameter of a function (e.g. the `TF1` constructor in your example) cppyy automatically generates a C++ wrapper for it. As part of the wrapper generation, cppyy jits Python headers, some of which still use (in Python2) the `register` keyword, which causes an error in C++ 17. For example, when running your reproducer with dev3 these errors appear first:. ```; In file included from /cvmfs/sft-nightlies.cern.ch/lcg/nightlies/dev3python2/Thu/ROOT/HEAD/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/CPyCppyy/API.h:30:; In file included from /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/Python.h:88:; /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/unicodeobject.h:534:5: error: ISO C++17 does not allow 'register' storage class specifier [-Wregister]; register PyObject *obj, /* Object */; ^~~~~~~~~; ```. this is what ultimately causes the `TF1` constructor error, since the C++ wrapper for the Python callable can't be generated. The errors above start appearing with 6.24 as a result of the LLVM upgrade. But it's legit that they appear, the Python2 headers are just old and not updated anymore.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8152#issuecomment-849596617
