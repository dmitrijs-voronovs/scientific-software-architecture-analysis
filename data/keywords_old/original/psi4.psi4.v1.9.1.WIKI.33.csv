DF-MP2: Density-Fitted 2nd-Order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DFMP2. Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic \(ov\) products in the; bra- and ket- of the \((ov|ov)\)-type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; MP2 defaults in PSI4 to the density-fitted code.

DF-MP2: Density-Fitted 2nd-Order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DFMP2. Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic \(ov\) products in the; bra- and ket- of the \((ov|ov)\)-type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; MP2 defaults in PSI4 to the density-fitted code.

A -D functional (Such; as the much cheaper B97-D) should be used instead. Hybrid FunctionalsMany common hybrid functionals, including the ubiquitous B3LYP. PBE0 and the; B97 series are also quite good for many thermochemical problems. LRC FunctionalsLRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE. We offer a stable implementation of the Gill; association function for wS and Head-Gordon’s wB97/wB97X functionals.; Additionally, we are pleased to have recently completed a heavily conditioned; implementation of the HJS exchange-hole model, which provides an analytical form; for the short-range enhancement factor for wPBE, wPBEsol, and wB88. From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole. We would like to thank Dr.; Scuseria for providing helpful advice and a reference implementations of the; older HSE exchange-hole model which led to the successful implementation of the; HJS model. Double-Hybrid FunctionalsDouble hybrids are percolating into PSI4.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, STRATMANN, NAIVE,; or SBECKE. The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D. The “best-practice” input file for KS-DFT is:; memory 1 GB # As much as you've got, the DF algorithm can use. molecule {; H; H 1 0.7; }. set {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; guess sad; }. energy('b3lyp').

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html

The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other. We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block). For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation.

Note; Starting version 1.4 (tag v1.4a1 in the development repository), PSI4 uses an updated and extended (to 104 elements) set; of Bragg-Slater radii. This leads to minimal deviations in absolute energies (1E-06 au) and; relative energies (below 0.002 kcal/mol for S22), depending also on the applied grid, compared; to older versions. We advise not to mix absolute energies absolute energies from before and after this change for the; calculation of relative energies. Note; After May 2017 (anytime after the v1.1 release), PSI4; switched from hand- (+Matlab) coded functionals to Libxc. Thus; many DFT results will be slightly different. Functionals more than; slightly different are B97-D, wB97X (note, not wB97X-D), SOGGA,; DFDL, and M05.

This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{tuned-LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r} + I_{\mathrm{IP}} +; \epsilon_{\mathrm{HOMO}}\]; Note that LRC functionals with default \(\omega\) only capture the; \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r},\]; hybrid functionals only capture part of the \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Hybrid}} (r) = -; \frac{\alpha}{r},\]; and local functionals decay exponentially, resulting in completely incorrect; asymptotics,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Local}} (r) = 0\]; IP-tuned LRC functionals effectively pin the chemical potential at \(N\); electrons to the correct value determined by the ionization potential. This; often cleans up the MSIE problem for a surprisingly large number of high-lying; occupied orbitals, as determined by fractional particle curves. Other gap; fitting techniques involving the electron affinity or band gap are sometimes; also used. IP-fitting is found to be particularly critical for the qualitative; determination of excited state ordering in many low band-gap systems.; For dispersion-bound complexes, a very simple additive empirical dispersion; potential, based on a damped Lennard-Jones potential can of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html

A -D functional (Such; as the much cheaper B97-D) should be used instead. Hybrid FunctionalsMany common hybrid functionals, including the ubiquitous B3LYP. PBE0 and the; B97 series are also quite good for many thermochemical problems. LRC FunctionalsLRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE. We offer a stable implementation of the Gill; association function for wS and Head-Gordon’s wB97/wB97X functionals.; Additionally, we are pleased to have recently completed a heavily conditioned; implementation of the HJS exchange-hole model, which provides an analytical form; for the short-range enhancement factor for wPBE, wPBEsol, and wB88. From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole. We would like to thank Dr.; Scuseria for providing helpful advice and a reference implementations of the; older HSE exchange-hole model which led to the successful implementation of the; HJS model. Double-Hybrid FunctionalsDouble hybrids are percolating into PSI4. Note that these are; only available with density-fitted, not conventional, MP2 algorithms. -D FunctionalsWe have several -D2 functionals implemented. -D3 functionls are available; with the installation of Grimme’s DFTD3 program.; For now, the pure-GGA B97-D; functional of Grimme is remarkably accurate, and the hybrid B3LYP-D; functional is also quite reliable. Note: we have made a sincere effort to rigorously test all functionals; implemented in PSI4 for correctness.

Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBFUNCTIONAL, LIBFOCK, LIBSCF_SOLVER; Both density functional theory and Hartree–Fock theory are controlled; through the SCF module, and the SCF Introduction; section is also relevant here. Note; Starting version 1.4 (tag v1.4a1 in the development repository), PSI4 uses an updated and extended (to 104 elements) set; of Bragg-Slater radii. This leads to minimal deviations in absolute energies (1E-06 au) and; relative energies (below 0.002 kcal/mol for S22), depending also on the applied grid, compared; to older versions. We advise not to mix absolute energies absolute energies from before and after this change for the; calculation of relative energies. Note; After May 2017 (anytime after the v1.1 release), PSI4; switched from hand- (+Matlab) coded functionals to Libxc. Thus; many DFT results will be slightly different. Functionals more than; slightly different are B97-D, wB97X (note, not wB97X-D), SOGGA,; DFDL, and M05. Theory¶; Generalized Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) [Kohn:1965:A1133] [Parr:1989] is one of the primary; workhorses of modern computational chemistry due to its phenomenal accuracy/cost; ratio.; Pure Kohn–Sham DFT is built on the Hohenberg–Kohn theorems [Hohenberg:1964:136] which states: A) the energy is a universal; functional of the one-particle electronic density and B) there exists a set of; noninteracting quasiparticles with the same density as the true set of; electrons, with the quasiparticle states determined as eigenvectors of an; effective one-body potential encapsulating the true \(N\)-body quantum; effects. The former idea allows the electronic density to be dealt with instead; of the much",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html

The; evaluation of these numerical integrals can be made to be linear scaling with a; reasonable amount of cleverness (mostly related to the fact that the basis; functions decay exponentially), meaning that the Coulomb and diagonalization; steps become rate limiting. This enormous potential speed gain over Hartree–Fock; with potentially exact treatment of electron correlation for “free” was one of; the primary motivations for KS-DFT’s adoption by chemists in the late 1980s and; early 1990s.; Unfortunately, local KS-DFT exhibits several spectacular failures, most of which; stem from the exponential decay of the local Kohn–Sham potential, which cannot; encapsulate long-range information in the exchange and correlation holes. In the; exchange hole, this manifests as the problem of Many-Electron Self-Interaction; Error (MSIE), which presents as spurious low-lying charge transfer states in; excited-state calculations, eventual metallic breakdown in extended insulators,; poor thermochemistry, and complete lack of a derivative discontinuity in the; chemical potential as integer particle numbers are crossed. On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn–Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn–Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount.

Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation.

This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0. Larger systems,; particularly conjugated systems, will typically have an optimized \(\omega\); between 0.1 and 0.5. Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

IP-fitting is found to be particularly critical for the qualitative; determination of excited state ordering in many low band-gap systems.; For dispersion-bound complexes, a very simple additive empirical dispersion; potential, based on a damped Lennard-Jones potential can often produce; remarkably accurate results with KS-DFT. This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” and more modern “-D3” approaches are a de facto industry standards. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn–Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; \(D_{2h}\) spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-6 energy; and density convergence criteria, a DF ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess (because single atom). For more information on; any of these options, see the relevant section below, or in the preceding; Hartree–Fock section.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in [Szabo:1982] on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by calling energy (or any driver function); with a dft_functional argument:; energy('scf', dft_functional = 'b3lyp'). Another alternative is providing a specially crafted dict-ionary to the dft_functional; argument:; custom_functional = { ""name"": ""my_unique_name"", ... }; energy('scf', dft_functional = custom_functional). For further details about this so called dict_func syntax, see; Advanced Functional Use and Manipulation.; For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree–Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summa",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft-1.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Optional arguments are minimum omega, maximum omega, molecule object; omega = ip_fitting('wb97', 0.4, 2.0, molecule=h2o). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

The; evaluation of these numerical integrals can be made to be linear scaling with a; reasonable amount of cleverness (mostly related to the fact that the basis; functions decay exponentially), meaning that the Coulomb and diagonalization; steps become rate limiting.

PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function \(\mathrm{erf}(\omega r_{12})\) as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. \[E_{\mathrm{xc}} = (1-\alpha) \int_{\mathrm{R}^3}; f_{\mathrm{xc}}; \left(; \rho_{\alpha} (\vec r_1),; \rho_{\beta} (\vec r_1),; \gamma_{\alpha\alpha} (\vec r_1),; \gamma_{\alpha\beta} (\vec r_1),; \gamma_{\beta\beta} (\vec r_1),; \tau_{\alpha} (\vec r_1),; \tau_{\beta} (\vec r_1); ; \omega \right) \ \mathrm{d} ^3 r_1\]. \[-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j}; \delta_{\sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}} \alpha \iint_{\mathrm{R}^6} \phi_{i}^1 \phi_{j}^1; \frac{1}{r_{12}} \phi_{i}^2 \phi_{j}^2 \ \mathrm{d}^3 r_1 \ \mathrm{d}^3 r_2\]. \[-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j}; \delta_{\sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}} (1-\alpha)\iint_{\mathrm{R}^6} \phi_{i}^1 \phi_{j",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html

Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the \(\omega\) is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between \(N-1\)-electron and \(N\)-electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz. This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{tuned-LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r} + I_{\mathrm{IP}} +; \epsilon_{\mathrm{HOMO}}\]; Note that LRC functionals with default \(\omega\) only capture the; \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r},\]; hybrid functionals only capture part of the \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Hybrid}} (r) = -; \frac{\alpha}{r},\]; and local functionals decay exponentially, resulting in completely incorrect; asymptotics,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Local}} (r) = 0\]; IP-tuned LRC functionals effectively pin the chemical potential at \(N\); electrons to the correct value determined by the ionization potential.

DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html

The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other. We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block). For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cati",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html

This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0. Larger systems,; particularly conjugated systems, will typically have an optimized \(\omega\); between 0.1 and 0.5. Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code.

For example, for LRC functionals, one can control the fraction of long-range Hartree-Fock and short-range DFA by changing DFT_OMEGA:; molecule ch2 {; 0 3; C; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A.

E = energy('wb97x'). # Revoke the change for later computations if needed; revoke_global_option_changed('DFT_OMEGA').

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D. The “best-practice” input file for KS-DFT is:; memory 1 GB # As much as you've got, the DF algorithm can use. molecule {; H; H 1 0.7; }. set {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; guess sad; }. energy('b3lyp').

A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0. Larger systems,; particularly conjugated systems, will typically have an optimized \(\omega\); between 0.1 and 0.5. Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral. An example is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # FRAC jobs will be be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do all kinds of weird stuff; basis aug-cc-pvdz # Augmented functions are very important on the anion side; scf_type df; }. # Argument is functional.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac_traverse('wb97', molecule=h2o).

Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the \(\omega\) is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between \(N-1\)-electron and \(N\)-electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

This; often cleans up the MSIE problem for a surprisingly large number of high-lying; occupied orbitals, as determined by fractional particle curves. Other gap; fitting techniques involving the electron affinity or band gap are sometimes; also used. IP-fitting is found to be particularly critical for the qualitative; determination of excited state ordering in many low band-gap systems.; For dispersion-bound complexes, a very simple additive empirical dispersion; potential, based on a damped Lennard-Jones potential can often produce; remarkably accurate results with KS-DFT. This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” and more modern “-D3” approaches are a de facto industry standards. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn–Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; \(D_{2h}\) spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-6 energy; and density convergence criteria, a DF ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess (because single atom). For more information on; any of these options, see the relevant section below, or in the preceding; Hartree–Fock section.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in [Szabo:1982] on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by calling energy (or any driver function); with a dft_functional argument:; energy('scf', dft_functional = 'b3lyp'). Another alternative is providing a specially crafted dict-ionary to the dft_functional; argument:; custom_functional = { ""name"": ""my_unique_name"", ... }; energy('scf', dft_functional = custom_functional). For further details about this so called dict_func syntax, see; Advanced Functional Use and Manipulation.; For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree–Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summa",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Optional arguments are minimum omega, maximum omega, molecule object; omega = ip_fitting('wb97', 0.4, 2.0, molecule=h2o). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use.

Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below.

Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dftd3.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dftd3.html

The parameters; fit for individual functionals are now \(s_6\), \(s_8\),; \(a_1\), and \(a_2\). \[E_{disp}^{\text{D3BJ}}=-\sum_{n=6,8} s_n \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}}; \frac{C_n^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^n + (f_{damp})^n}\]. \[f_{damp} = a_1 \sqrt{\frac{C_8^{ij}}{C_6^{ij}}} + a_2\]; All parameters characterizing the dispersion correction are taken from; Grimme’s website; or else from the literature. Running DFTD3¶; A number of a posteriori dispersion corrections are available in; PSI4. While some are computed within PSI4‘s codebase (-D1, -D2,; -CHG, -DAS2009, -DAS2010), the -D3 correction and its variants are; available only through the DFTD3 program. Once installed, the; dftd3/PSI4 interface is transparent, and all corrections are; interfaced exactly alike.; Dispersion corrections are built into DFT functionals, so appending an a; posteriori correction to a computation is as simple as; energy('b2plyp-d') vs. energy('b2plyp'). For example, the; following input file computes (with much redundant work) for water a; B3LYP, a B3LYP-D2, and a B3LYP-D3 (zero-damping) energy.; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; energy('b3lyp'); energy('b3lyp-d'); energy('b3lyp-d3'). Consult the table -D Functionals to see for each; functional what corrections are available and what default parameters; define them. The dispersion correction is available after a calculation in; the PSI variable DISPERSION CORRECTION ENERGY.; By default, the output from the dftd3; program is suppressed; to see it in the output file, set print > 2.

Role — In PSI4, DKH is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (relativistic effects).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) dkh; Upstream Dependencies — dkh \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran. CMake Variables. ENABLE_dkh — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with dkh; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found.

Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/dkh/dkhConfig.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_dkh — CMake variable to force internal build of dkh instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_dkh — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built dkh and not falling back on internal build. Examples. Build bundled. >>> cmake -DENABLE_dkh=ON. Build without dkh. >>> cmake. Link against pre-built. >>> cmake -DENABLE_dkh=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/dkh/root. >>> cmake -DENABLE_dkh=ON -Ddkh_DIR=/path/to/dkh/configdir. Build bundled despite pre-built being detectable. >>> cmake -DENABLE_dkh=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/unwanted/dkh/root/and/wanted/other/dependencies/root -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_dkh=ON. table of contents.

Updating the PSI4 Users’ and Programmers’ Manual¶; PSI4‘s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman. It is available online at; http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/index.html; for the latest development branch. Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from psicode, so most users and developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; Math is rendered through MathJax, so LaTeX and dvipng are no longer needed.; The sphinx executable should be in your path at CMake configure time for; documentation targets to be available.

Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in the same; format, hyperlinking within and to external websites, and generating; documentation in different formats from the same source. PSI4‘s; documentation is a unified document covering information for both users; and programmers in separate sections.

Python docstrings are absorbed as-is, so; please use reST math formatting (essentially $latex math$ \(\Rightarrow\); :math:`latex math`).; Starting around PSI4 1.1, MathJax is used for in-browser LaTeX; rendering in place of offline PNG generation of math images. Check the; online rendering, as occasionally there will be errors even when the LaTeX; looked sound. The Map of the Sphinx¶. Adding a new Appendix or First-TOC-Level page; Create your reST file and fill it with information. Add the name of your; file to psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/appendices.rst for an appendix or; to psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/index.rst for a first-TOC-level.; Finally, add your file to the STATICDOC variable in; psi4/doc/sphinxman/CMakeLists.txt. Sphinx will now build with your; new page. Adding a new module to “Theoretical Methods”; Copy the file of a well-established module, like; psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst. Change the title, author, sec; label, ref, and source labels at the top of the file to point instead to; your code. Edit psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/methods.rst to add the; name of your file so that it will appear in the TOC tree. Add your file; to the STATICDOC variable in; psi4/doc/sphinxman/CMakeLists.txt. Sphinx will now build with your new; file. Follow the models in existing methods pages to write your; documentation. If you don’t get all the keyword links, bibliography; links, sample inputs, math, tables, etc. working in Sphinx, don’t worry; about it.

Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing PSI4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; psi4 -m. The mechanism for restarting HF/DFT calculations is described in details here. Saving the Wavefunction¶; A core object of PSI4 is the Wavefunction (short wfn) object; energy, wfn = energy('scf',return_wfn=True). This C++/Python object (psi4.core.Wavefunction) contains orbital; data, basis set information, result variables and more.; It can be saved either to a numpy file or converted to a python dictionary; # write the wavefunction to file; wfn.to_file('my_wfn'). # alternatively store the dict representation of the wavefunction in memory; wfn_dict = wfn.to_file(). In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefun",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html

Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html:14764,Availability,echo,echo,14764,"ted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. PBS job file¶; To run a PSI4 job on a PBS queueing system, you need to properly set up; all necessary variables in the PBS job file. Below is a minimal example of; a PBS job file for a threaded job, and a short explanation for each section.; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR; setenv myscratch /scratch/user/psi4.$PBS_JOBID. foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Creating scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; ssh $i mkdir -p $myscratch; end. unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if !

Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. PBS job file¶; To run a PSI4 job on a PBS queueing system, you need to properly set up; all necessary variables in the PBS job file. Below is a minimal example of; a PBS job file for a threaded job, and a short explanation for each section.; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR; setenv myscratch /scratch/user/psi4.$PBS_JOBID. foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Creating scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; ssh $i mkdir -p $myscratch; end. unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if !

The top section features PBS-specific commands. These depend on the; specific characteristics of your PBS queuing system but they may include:; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node. The total memory requested for; the job by PBS should generally be slightly greater than what indicated; in the input file (see memory setting).; Then, we move to the working directory using PBS variable $PBS_O_WORKDIR and; we create scratch directories on every node, using the $PBS_NODEFILE which; points to a file conta",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html

( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/external/modules:${PSIPATH}; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/python/modules:${PSIPATH}. PSIDATADIR does not need to be set.; In the present example we unset it to make sure it does not interfere with the internal location-finding.; PSIPATH is needed only if you are using external modules or; plugins in PSI4 and should point to the directories where they can be found. In the; present example, we make sure the variable is set with if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; before adding more paths to it. Finally, PSI_SCRATCH should point to a fast, existing; local disk for temporary file storage. To use 4 threads for OpenMP parallelization; and threaded BLAS (see section Threading), we set -n4 below.; The next step is then to actually run the computation:; /psi/install/directory/bin/psi4 -i input.in -o input.out -n 4. And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines.

Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Scratch Files¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file.; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files.

PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) to analyze the optimization. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(12, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(12, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_INT",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html

During; execution, the ~/.psi4rc defaults will be loaded in first, but then the commands; in the input file will be executed.; The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables.

All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) to analyze the optimization. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(12, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(12, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_INTCO, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_INTCO, True).

Saving the Wavefunction¶; A core object of PSI4 is the Wavefunction (short wfn) object; energy, wfn = energy('scf',return_wfn=True). This C++/Python object (psi4.core.Wavefunction) contains orbital; data, basis set information, result variables and more.; It can be saved either to a numpy file or converted to a python dictionary; # write the wavefunction to file; wfn.to_file('my_wfn'). # alternatively store the dict representation of the wavefunction in memory; wfn_dict = wfn.to_file(). In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefunction from file; wfn_from_file = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file('my_wfn'). # make a wavefunction from the dict; wfn_from_dict = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file(wfn_dict). ~/.psi4rc File¶.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads.

Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> ps",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html

Otherwise, the; output filename defaults to the the input filename with; “.out” extension. --psiapi-path¶; Generates a bash command to source correct Python interpreter and path for python -c ""import psi4"". --qcschema¶; Runs input files as QCSchema. Can either be JSON or MessagePack input. -s <name>, --scratch <name>¶; This overrides the value of PSI_SCRATCH and provides; a path to the location of scratch files. -t <subset>, --test <subset>¶; Runs pytest tests.

Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4.

Scratch Files¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files.

Elementary Restart¶; The PSI4 intermediate files use the following naming scheme; psi.PID.name.filenumber. where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content.; For those modules providing restart capabilities, the previous file can; be provided through the``restart_file`` option; energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). Only the filenumber is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the; file and copy it to the scratch directory where PSI4 will expect it.; The restart capabilities of a specific method (if any) are found in that method’s documentation.; To provide multiple files, pass them as arguments of a Python list; energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']). Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing PSI4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; psi4 -m. The mechanism for restarting HF/DFT calculations is described in details here. Saving the Wavefunction¶; A core object of PSI4 is the Wavefunction (short wfn) object; energy, wfn = energy('scf',return_wfn=True). This C++/Python object (psi4.core.Wavefunction) contains orbital; data, basis set information, result variables and more.; It can be saved either to a numpy file or converted to a python dictionary; # write the wavefunction to file; wfn.to_file('my_wfn'). # alternatively store the dict representation of the wavefunction in memory; wfn_dict = wfn.to_file(). In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefun",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html

Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html

This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Place the path in the ~/.psi4rc file so that it is available for; every PSI4 instance.; sys.path.insert(0, '/home/user/psiadditions'). Place the path in the input file, either absolute or relative.; sys.path.insert(0, '../../psiadditions'); sys.path.insert(0, '/home/user/psiadditions'). PSIDATADIR¶; Path in which the PSI4 executable looks for its non-compiled; dependencies (i.e., basis sets, databases, quadratures, etc.).; This path is always known by the PSI4 program or shared library,; so this variable is relevant primarily to developers wanting a; non-standard location. Value should be set; to directory containing driver, basis, etc. directories, generally; ending in share/psi4. table of contents.

Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. PBS job file¶; To run a PSI4 job on a PBS queueing system, you need to properly set up; all necessary variables in the PBS job file. Below is a minimal example of; a PBS job file for a threaded job, and a short explanation for each section.; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR; setenv myscratch /scratch/user/psi4.$PBS_JOBID. foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Creating scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; ssh $i mkdir -p $myscratch; end. unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if !

The top section features PBS-specific commands. These depend on the; specific characteristics of your PBS queuing system but they may include:; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node. The total memory requested for; the job by PBS should generally be slightly greater than what indicated; in the input file (see memory setting).; Then, we move to the working directory using PBS variable $PBS_O_WORKDIR and; we create scratch directories on every node, using the $PBS_NODEFILE which; points to a file conta",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html

( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/external/modules:${PSIPATH}; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/python/modules:${PSIPATH}. PSIDATADIR does not need to be set.; In the present example we unset it to make sure it does not interfere with the internal location-finding.; PSIPATH is needed only if you are using external modules or; plugins in PSI4 and should point to the directories where they can be found. In the; present example, we make sure the variable is set with if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; before adding more paths to it. Finally, PSI_SCRATCH should point to a fast, existing; local disk for temporary file storage. To use 4 threads for OpenMP parallelization; and threaded BLAS (see section Threading), we set -n4 below.; The next step is then to actually run the computation:; /psi/install/directory/bin/psi4 -i input.in -o input.out -n 4. And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html

Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Scratch Files¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file.; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files.

PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) to analyze the optimization.

All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) to analyze the optimization. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(12, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(12, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_INTCO, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_INTCO, True).

In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefunction from file; wfn_from_file = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file('my_wfn'). # make a wavefunction from the dict; wfn_from_dict = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file(wfn_dict). ~/.psi4rc File¶.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model.

This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz"").

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103].

Caution; In constrast to Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code, FISAPT uses the -JKFIT; auxiliary basis sets for all Fock-type terms (e.g., electrostatics, exchange,; induction, and core Fock matrix elements in exchange-dispersion), and the -RI; auxiliary basis sets only for the dispersion term. Ed’s code uses the -RI; basis sets for all SAPT terms, which can be problematic for heavy elements.; As such, Ed’s SAPT0 code will yield slightly different results than FISAPT.

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; A video tutorial series for the use of the FISAPT module is available here.; Specific videos in the series include:.

This is essentially the same input as for F-SAPT, except that the molecular; system is now divided into three moieties – subsystems A and B whose; intramolecular interaction we wish to compute, and a linking unit C. This file; runs a DF-HF computation on the full system using PSI4‘s existing SCF code.; At the start of the FISAPT code, the occupied orbitals are localized and divided; by charge considerations into A, B, C, and link sets. By default, linking sigma; bonds are assigned to C (this can be changed by the FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT; options). Then, non-interacting Hartree–Fock solutions for A and B are optimized; in the embedding field of the linking moiety C. At this point, A and B are not; interacting with each other, but have any potential covalent links or other; interactions with C built in by the embedding. A standard F-SAPT0 computation; is then performed between A and B, yielding the I-SAPT interaction energy. Any; F-SAPT considerations are also possible when I-SAPT is performed – F and I are; completely direct-product-separable considerations.

Briefly, the interaction between the point charges in A(B); and fragment B(A) enters the SAPT0 interction energy. It explicitly affects in the electrostatics; and induction components, and implicitly affects other SAPT0 components by polarizing the orbitals.; If point charges are present in both subsystems A and B, an additional charge-charge interaction; term is also added to the electrostatic energy.

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; A video tutorial series for the use of the FISAPT module is available here.; Specific videos in the series include:.

Caution; In constrast to Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code, FISAPT uses the -JKFIT; auxiliary basis sets for all Fock-type terms (e.g., electrostatics, exchange,; induction, and core Fock matrix elements in exchange-dispersion), and the -RI; auxiliary basis sets only for the dispersion term. Ed’s code uses the -RI; basis sets for all SAPT terms, which can be problematic for heavy elements.; As such, Ed’s SAPT0 code will yield slightly different results than FISAPT.

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; A video tutorial series for the use of the FISAPT module is available here.; Specific videos in the series include:.

This is essentially the same input as for F-SAPT, except that the molecular; system is now divided into three moieties – subsystems A and B whose; intramolecular interaction we wish to compute, and a linking unit C. This file; runs a DF-HF computation on the full system using PSI4‘s existing SCF code.; At the start of the FISAPT code, the occupied orbitals are localized and divided; by charge considerations into A, B, C, and link sets. By default, linking sigma; bonds are assigned to C (this can be changed by the FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT; options). Then, non-interacting Hartree–Fock solutions for A and B are optimized; in the embedding field of the linking moiety C. At this point, A and B are not; interacting with each other, but have any potential covalent links or other; interactions with C built in by the embedding. A standard F-SAPT0 computation; is then performed between A and B, yielding the I-SAPT interaction energy. Any; F-SAPT considerations are also possible when I-SAPT is performed – F and I are; completely direct-product-separable considerations. Cube File Visualization with PyMol¶; Setting FISAPT_DO_PLOT true above generates a set of .cube files; containing the densities and ESPs of the various subsystems in the I-SAPT; embedding procedure.

Adding Point Charges to F/I-SAPT Computations¶; Point charges can be added to the interacting subsystems A and B as well; as to the linking fragment C. Briefly, the interaction between the point charges in A(B); and fragment B(A) enters the SAPT0 interction energy. It explicitly affects in the electrostatics; and induction components, and implicitly affects other SAPT0 components by polarizing the orbitals.; If point charges are present in both subsystems A and B, an additional charge-charge interaction; term is also added to the electrostatic energy.

Coupled electron pair approximation¶; Coupled-pair methods can be viewed as approximations to CCSD or as; size-extensive modifications of CISD.

Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) [or the resolution of the identity (RI)] and Cholesky; decomposition (CD) techniques are popular in quantum chemistry to avoid; the computation and storage of the 4-index electron repulsion integral; (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the computational scaling of some terms.; DF/CD-CCSD(T) computations are available in PSI4, with or without the; use of FNOs, through the FNOCC module. The implementation and accuracy of; the DF/CD-CCSD(T) method are described in [DePrince:2013:2687].; The DF-CCSD(T) procedure uses two auxiliary basis sets. The first set is; that used in the SCF procedure, defined by the DF_BASIS_SCF; keyword. If this keyword is not specified, an appropriate -JKFIT set is; automatically selected.

(1)¶\[\begin{split}\langle \Psi_0 | (H - E) (1 + T_1 + T_2 + \frac{1}{2}T_1^2)|\Psi_0\rangle = 0, \\; \langle \Psi_i^a | (H - E) (1 + T_1 + T_2 + \frac{1}{2}T_1^2+T_1T_2+\frac{1}{3!}T_1^3)|\Psi_0\rangle = 0, \\; \langle \Psi_{ij}^{ab} | (H - E) (1 + T_1 + T_2 + \frac{1}{2}T_1^2 + T_1T_2+\frac{1}{3!}T_1^3+\frac{1}{2}T_2^2+\frac{1}{2}T_1^2T_2+\frac{1}{4!}T_1^4)|\Psi_0\rangle = 0, \\\end{split}\]; where we have chosen the intermediate normalization,; \(\langle \Psi_0| \Psi \rangle = 1\), and the symbols \(T_1\); and \(T_2\) represent single and double excitation operators.

FNOCC: Frozen natural orbitals for CCSD(T), QCISD(T), CEPA, and MP4¶; Code author: A. Eugene DePrince; Section author: A. Eugene DePrince; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FNOCC. Warning; There is a known bug concerning the i7-5930 series combined; with the Intel 15 compilers and MKL 11.2.3. When PSI4 is compiled; under these conditions, parallel runs of the FNOCC code have experienced; nonsensical CCSD correlation energies (often several Hartrees lower; than the starting guess). At the moment, the only confirmed solutions; are running serially, using a different BLAS implementation, or upgrading; to Intel 16.0.2 and MKL 11.3.2.

CISD,; CCSD, and the coupled-pair methods discussed below all scale formally with; the sixth power of system size, and, as with the QCISD method, CEPA; methods retain \({\cal{O}}(o^2v^4)\) complexity of the CCSD equations.; For a detailed discussion of the properties of various coupled-pair; methods, see [Wennmohs:2008:217].; What follows is a very basic description of the practical differences in; the equations that define each of the coupled-pair methods implemented in; PSI4.
