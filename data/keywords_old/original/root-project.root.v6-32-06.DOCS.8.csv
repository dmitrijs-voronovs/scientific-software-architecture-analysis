In general, there are three requirements in order for; a compiler-supported reference-count system to provide reliable; interoperation:. * The type system must reliably identify which objects are to be managed. An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a convention very reliably, at least for; system libraries on macOS, and functions always pass objects at +0. The; C-based APIs for Core Foundation objects, on the other hand, have much more; varied transfer semantics. The use of ``__attribute__((NSObject))`` typedefs is not recommended.

A type is a :arc-term:`C retainable pointer type` if it is a pointer to; (possibly qualified) ``void`` or a pointer to a (possibly qualifier) ``struct``; or ``class`` type. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC does not manage pointers of CoreFoundation type (or any of the related; families of retainable C pointers which interoperate with Objective-C for; retain/release operation).

Several of these functions are semantically equivalent to a message send; we; emit calls to C functions instead because:. * the machine code to do so is significantly smaller,; * it is much easier to recognize the C functions in the ARC optimizer, and; * a sufficient sophisticated runtime may be able to avoid the message send in; common cases.

The rules for objects are covered in the next section. A :arc-term:`retainable object pointer` (or ""retainable pointer"") is a value of; a :arc-term:`retainable object pointer type` (""retainable type""). There are; three kinds of retainable object pointer types:. * block pointers (formed by applying the caret (``^``) declarator sigil to a; function type); * Objective-C object pointers (``id``, ``Class``, ``NSFoo*``, etc.); * typedefs marked with ``__attribute__((NSObject))``. Other pointer types, such as ``int*`` and ``CFStringRef``, are not subject to; ARC's semantics and restrictions. .. admonition:: Rationale. We are not at liberty to require all code to be recompiled with ARC;; therefore, ARC must interoperate with Objective-C code which manages retains; and releases manually. In general, there are three requirements in order for; a compiler-supported reference-count system to provide reliable; interoperation:. * The type system must reliably identify which objects are to be managed. An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a conv",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst

Retain count semantics; ----------------------. A retainable object pointer is either a :arc-term:`null pointer` or a pointer; to a valid object. Furthermore, if it has block pointer type and is not; ``null`` then it must actually be a pointer to a block object, and if it has; ``Class`` type (possibly protocol-qualified) then it must actually be a pointer; to a class object. Otherwise ARC does not enforce the Objective-C type system; as long as the implementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings.

A type is a :arc-term:`retainable object owner type` if it is a retainable; object pointer type or an array type whose element type is a retainable object; owner type. An :arc-term:`ownership qualifier` is a type qualifier which applies only to; retainable object owner types. An array type is ownership-qualified according; to its element type, and adding an ownership qualifier to an array type so; qualifies its element type.

However, that rule is clearly; untenable in ARC, since it leads to default-unsafe code. The main merit to; banning the properties is to avoid confusion with non-ARC practice, which did; not ultimately strike us as sufficient to justify requiring extra syntax and; (more importantly) forcing novices to understand ownership rules just to; declare a property when the default is so reasonable. Changing the rule away; from non-ARC practice was acceptable because we had conservatively banned the; synthesis in order to give ourselves exactly this leeway. Applying ``__attribute__((NSObject))`` to a property not of retainable object; pointer type has the same behavior it does outside of ARC: it requires the; property type to be some sort of pointer and permits the use of modifiers other; than ``assign``.

Using structs can resolve some of this tension. ``__autoreleasing`` is forbidden because it is treacherous to rely; on autoreleases as an ownership tool outside of a function-local; contexts. Earlier releases of Clang permitted ``__strong`` and ``__weak`` only; references in Objective-C++ classes, not in Objective-C. This; restriction was an undesirable short-term constraint arising from the; complexity of adding support for non-trivial struct types to C. In Objective-C++, nontrivially ownership-qualified types are treated; for nearly all purposes as if they were class types with non-trivial; default constructors, copy constructors, move constructors, copy assignment; operators, move assignment operators, and destructors. This includes the; determination of the triviality of special members of classes with a; non-static data member of such a type. In Objective-C, the definition cannot be so succinct: because the C; standard lacks rules for non-trivial types, those rules must first be; developed. They are given in the next section. The intent is that these; rules are largely consistent with the rules of C++ for code expressible; in both languages. Formal rules for non-trivial types in C; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

Therefore,; non-ARC callers must ensure that such fields are initialized to a +1; reference, and non-ARC callees must balance that +1 by releasing the; reference or transferring it as appropriate. Likewise, a function returning a non-trivial struct may be written in; ARC and called from non-ARC or vice-versa. The convention for this; always transfers ownership of objects stored in ``__strong`` fields; from the callee to the caller, and so callees must initialize such; fields with +1 references, and callers must balance that +1 by releasing; or transferring them.

Additionally, a program is ill-formed if it declares or; contains a call to an ``init`` method whose return type is neither ``id`` nor; a pointer to a super-class or sub-class of the declaring class (if the method; was declared on a class) or the static receiver type of the call (if it was; declared on a protocol). .. admonition:: Rationale. There are a fair number of existing methods with ``init``-like selectors; which nonetheless don't follow the ``init`` conventions. Typically these; are either accidental naming collisions or helper methods called during; initialization. Because of the peculiar retain/release behavior of; ``init`` methods, it's very important not to treat these methods as; ``init`` methods if they aren't meant to be. It was felt that implicitly; defining these methods out of the family based on the exact relationship; between the return type and the declaring class would be much too subtle; and fragile. Therefore we identify a small number of legitimate-seeming; return types and call everything else an error. This serves the secondary; purpose of encouraging programmers not to accidentally give methods names; in the ``init`` family. Note that a method with an ``init``-family selector which returns a; non-Objective-C type (e.g. ``void``) is perfectly well-formed; it simply; isn't in the ``init`` family.

About this document; ===================. .. _arc.meta.purpose:. Purpose; -------. The first and primary purpose of this document is to serve as a complete; technical specification of Automatic Reference Counting. Given a core; Objective-C compiler and runtime, it should be possible to write a compiler and; runtime which implements these new semantics. The secondary purpose is to act as a rationale for why ARC was designed in this; way. This should remain tightly focused on the technical design and should not; stray into marketing speculation. .. _arc.meta.background:. Background; ----------. This document assumes a basic familiarity with C. :arc-term:`Blocks` are a C language extension for creating anonymous functions.; Users interact with and transfer block objects using :arc-term:`block; pointers`, which are represented like a normal pointer. A block may capture; values from local variables; when this occurs, memory must be dynamically; allocated. The initial allocation is done on the stack, but the runtime; provides a ``Block_copy`` function which, given a block pointer, either copies; the underlying block object to the heap, setting its reference count to 1 and; returning the new block pointer, or (if the block object is already on the; heap) increases its reference count by 1. The paired function is; ``Block_release``, which decreases the reference count by 1 and destroys the; object if the count reaches zero and is on the heap. Objective-C is a set of language extensions, significant enough to be; considered a different language. It is a strict superset of C. The extensions; can also be imposed on C++, producing a language called Objective-C++. The; primary feature is a single-inheritance object system; we briefly describe the; modern dialect. Objective-C defines a new type kind, collectively called the :arc-term:`object; pointer types`. This kind has two notable builtin ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst

Method declarations may also be grouped into :arc-term:`protocols`, which are not; inherently associated with any class, but which classes may claim to follow.; Object pointer types may be qualified with additional protocols that the object; is known to support. :arc-term:`Class extensions` are collections of ivars and methods, designed to; allow a class's ``@interface`` to be split across multiple files; however,; there is still a primary implementation file which must see the; ``@interface``\ s of all class extensions. :arc-term:`Categories` allow; methods (but not ivars) to be declared *post hoc* on an arbitrary class; the; methods in the category's ``@implementation`` will be dynamically added to that; class's method tables which the category is loaded at runtime, replacing those; methods in case of a collision. In the standard environment, objects are allocated on the heap, and their; lifetime is manually managed using a reference count. This is done using two; instance methods which all classes are expected to implement: ``retain``; increases the object's reference count by 1, whereas ``release`` decreases it; by 1 and calls the instance method ``dealloc`` if the count reaches 0. To; simplify certain operations, there is also an :arc-term:`autorelease pool`, a; thread-local list of objects to call ``release`` on later; an object can be; added to this pool by calling ``autorelease`` on it. Block pointers may be converted to type ``id``; block objects are laid out in a; way that makes them compatible with Objective-C objects. There is a builtin; class that all block objects are considered to be objects of; this class; implements ``retain`` by adjusting the reference count, not by calling; ``Block_copy``. .. _arc.meta.evolution:.

Failing to call ``[super dealloc]`` in such a; method is nearly always a bug. Sometimes, the object is simply trying to; prevent itself from being destroyed, but ``dealloc`` is really far too late; for the object to be raising such objections. Somewhat more legitimately, an; object may have been pool-allocated and should not be deallocated with; ``free``; for now, this can only be supported with a ``dealloc``; implementation outside of ARC. Such an implementation must be very careful; to do all the other work that ``NSObject``'s ``dealloc`` would, which is; outside the scope of this document to describe.

It is common in non-ARC code to not return an autoreleased value; therefore; the convention does not force either path. It is convenient to not be; required to do unnecessary retains and autoreleases; this permits; optimizations such as eliding retain/autoreleases when it can be shown that; the original pointer will still be valid at the point of return.

Dependency does propagate through return values of pointer type.; The compelling source of need for this rule is a property accessor; which returns an un-autoreleased result; the calling function must; have the chance to operate on the value, e.g. to retain it, before; ARC releases the original pointer.

This rule is intended to prohibit ARC from observably extending the; lifetime of a retainable object, other than as specified in this; document. Together with the rule limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs.

Since it's extremely uncommon to actually; do so, even unintentionally, and since there's no natural way for the; programmer to remove this retain/release pair otherwise (as there is for; other parameters by, say, making the variable ``objc_externally_retained`` or; qualifying it with ``__unsafe_unretained``), we chose to make this optimizing; assumption and shift some amount of risk to the user. .. _arc.misc.enumeration:.

An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a convention very reliably, at least for; system libraries on macOS, and functions always pass objects at +0.

The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings.

It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped. It may not throw an; exception.

C++ programmers who have not already disabled exceptions are; much more likely to actual require exception-safety. ARC does end the lifetimes of ``__weak`` objects when an exception terminates; their scope unless exceptions are disabled in the compiler. .. admonition:: Rationale. The consequence of a local ``__weak`` object not being destroyed is very; likely to be corruption of the Objective-C runtime, so we want to be safer; here. Of course, potentially massive leaks are about as likely to take down; the process as this corruption is if the program does try to recover from; exceptions. .. _arc.misc.interior:. Interior pointers; -----------------. An Objective-C method returning a non-retainable pointer may be annotated with; the ``objc_returns_inner_pointer`` attribute to indicate that it returns a; handle to the internal data of an object, and that this reference will be; invalidated if the object is destroyed. When such a message is sent to an; object, the object's lifetime will be extended until at least the earliest of:. * the last use of the returned pointer, or any pointer derived from it, in the; calling function or; * the autorelease pool is restored to a previous state. .. admonition:: Rationale. Rationale: not all memory and resources are managed with reference counts; it; is common for objects to manage private resources in their own, private way.; Typically these resources are completely encapsulated within the object, but; some classes offer their users direct access for efficiency. If ARC is not; aware of methods that return such ""interior"" pointers, its optimizations can; cause the owning object to be reclaimed too soon. This attribute informs ARC; that it must tread lightly. The extension rules are somewhat intentionally vague. The autorelease pool; limit is there to permit a simple implementation to simply retain and; autorelease the receiver. The other limit permits some amount of; optimization.

The other limit permits some amount of; optimization. The phrase ""derived from"" is intended to encompass the results; both of pointer transformations, such as casts and arithmetic, and of loading; from such derived pointers; furthermore, it applies whether or not such; derivations are applied directly in the calling code or by other utility code; (for example, the C library routine ``strchr``). However, the implementation; never need account for uses after a return from the code which calls the; method returning an interior pointer. As an exception, no extension is required if the receiver is loaded directly; from a ``__strong`` object with :ref:`precise lifetime semantics; <arc.optimization.precise>`. .. admonition:: Rationale. Implicit autoreleases carry the risk of significantly inflating memory use,; so it's important to provide users a way of avoiding these autoreleases.; Tying this to precise lifetime semantics is ideal, as for local variables; this requires a very explicit annotation, which allows ARC to trust the user; with good cheer. .. _arc.misc.c-retainable:. C retainable pointer types; --------------------------. A type is a :arc-term:`C retainable pointer type` if it is a pointer to; (possibly qualified) ``void`` or a pointer to a (possibly qualifier) ``struct``; or ``class`` type. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC does not manage pointers of CoreFoundation type (or any of the related; families of retainable C pointers which interoperate with Objective-C for; retain/release operation). In fact, ARC does not even know how to; distinguish these types from arbitrary C pointer types. The intent of this; concept is to filter out some obviously non-object types while leaving a hook; for later tightening if a means of exhaustively marking CF types is made; available. .. _arc.misc.c-retainable.audit:.

The actual methods; dynamically found in a class are not those declared in the ``@interface``, but; those defined in a separate ``@implementation`` declaration; however, when; compiling a call, typechecking is done based on the methods declared in the; ``@interface``. Method declarations may also be grouped into :arc-term:`protocols`, which are not; inherently associated with any class, but which classes may claim to follow.; Object pointer types may be qualified with additional protocols that the object; is known to support. :arc-term:`Class extensions` are collections of ivars and methods, designed to; allow a class's ``@interface`` to be split across multiple files; however,; there is still a primary implementation file which must see the; ``@interface``\ s of all class extensions. :arc-term:`Categories` allow; methods (but not ivars) to be declared *post hoc* on an arbitrary class; the; methods in the category's ``@implementation`` will be dynamically added to that; class's method tables which the category is loaded at runtime, replacing those; methods in case of a collision. In the standard environment, objects are allocated on the heap, and their; lifetime is manually managed using a reference count. This is done using two; instance methods which all classes are expected to implement: ``retain``; increases the object's reference count by 1, whereas ``release`` decreases it; by 1 and calls the instance method ``dealloc`` if the count reaches 0.

Retainable object pointers as operands and arguments; ----------------------------------------------------. In general, ARC does not perform retain or release operations when simply using; a retainable object pointer as an operand within an expression. This includes:. * loading a retainable pointer from an object with non-weak :ref:`ownership; <arc.ownership>`,; * passing a retainable pointer as an argument to a function or method, and; * receiving a retainable pointer as the result of a function or method call. .. admonition:: Rationale. While this might seem uncontroversial, it is actually unsafe when multiple; expressions are evaluated in ""parallel"", as with binary operators and calls,; because (for example) one expression might load from an object while another; writes to it. However, C and C++ already call this undefined behavior; because the evaluations are unsequenced, and ARC simply exploits that here to; avoid needing to retain arguments across a large number of calls.

We've so far consciously refrained from implicitly turning retained CF; results from function calls into ``__bridge_transfer`` casts. The worry is; that some code patterns --- for example, creating a CF value, assigning it; to an ObjC-typed local, and then calling ``CFRelease`` when done --- are a; bit too likely to be accidentally accepted, leading to mysterious behavior.

It is undefined behavior if the storage of a ``__strong`` or ``__weak``; object is not properly initialized before the first managed operation; is performed on the object, or if the storage of such an object is freed; or reused before the object has been properly deinitialized.

A ``__strong`` object may also be properly initialized; by copying into it (e.g. with ``memcpy``) the representation of a; different ``__strong`` object whose storage has been properly initialized;; doing this properly deinitializes the source object and causes its storage; to no longer be properly initialized.

Within this section, the word :arc-term:`function` will be used to; refer to any structured unit of code, be it a C function, an; Objective-C method, or a block. This specification describes ARC as performing specific ``retain`` and; ``release`` operations on retainable object pointers at specific; points during the execution of a program. These operations make up a; non-contiguous subsequence of the computation history of the program.; The portion of this sequence for a particular retainable object; pointer for which a specific function execution is directly; responsible is the :arc-term:`formal local retain history` of the; object pointer. The corresponding actual sequence executed is the; `dynamic local retain history`. However, under certain circumstances, ARC is permitted to re-order and; eliminate operations in a manner which may alter the overall; computation history beyond what is permitted by the general ""as if""; rule of C/C++ and the :ref:`restrictions <arc.objects.retains>` on; the implementation of ``retain`` and ``release``. .. admonition:: Rationale.

Otherwise ARC does not enforce the Objective-C type system; as long as the implementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions.

In earlier releases, when non-trivial ownership was only permitted; on fields in Objective-C++, the ABI used for such classes was the; ordinary ABI for non-trivial C++ classes, which passes arguments and; returns indirectly and does not transfer responsibility for arguments.; When support for Objective-C structs was added, it was decided to; change to the current ABI for three reasons:. - It permits ARC / non-ARC compatibility for structs containing only; ``__strong`` references, as long as the non-ARC side is careful about; transferring ownership. - It avoids unnecessary indirection for sufficiently small types that; the C ABI would prefer to pass in registers. - Given that struct arguments must be produced at +1 to satisfy C's; semantics of initializing the local parameter variable, transferring; ownership of that copy to the callee is generally better for ARC; optimization, since otherwise there will be releases in the caller; that are much harder to pair with transfers in the callee. Breaking compatibility with existing Objective-C++ structures was; considered an acceptable cost, as most Objective-C++ code does not have; binary-compatibility requirements. Any existing code which cannot accept; this compatibility break, which is necessarily Objective-C++, should; force the use of the standard C++ ABI by declaring an empty (but; non-defaulted) destructor. .. _arc.ownership.inference:.

In this case, when invoked in an explicit; message send, it is assumed to return a type related to the type of the; receiver:. * if it is a class method, and the receiver is a class name ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T*``; otherwise; * if it is an instance method, and the receiver has type ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T``; otherwise; * the message send expression has the normal result type of the method. This is a new rule of the Objective-C language and applies outside of ARC. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC's automatic code emission is more prone than most code to signature; errors, i.e. errors where a call was emitted against one method signature,; but the implementing method has an incompatible signature. Having more; precise type information helps drastically lower this risk, as well as; catching a number of latent bugs. .. _arc.optimization:. Optimization; ============. Within this section, the word :arc-term:`function` will be used to; refer to any structured unit of code, be it a C function, an; Objective-C method, or a block. This specification describes ARC as performing specific ``retain`` and; ``release`` operations on retainable object pointers at specific; points during the execution of a program. These operations make up a; non-contiguous subsequence of the computation history of the program.; The portion of this sequence for a particular retainable object; pointer for which a specific function execution is directly; responsible is the :arc-term:`formal local retain history` of the; object pointer. The corresponding actual sequence executed is the; `dynamic local retain history`. However, under certain circumstances, ARC is permitted to re-order and; eliminate operations in a manner which may alter the overall; computation history be",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst

Autorelease pools are clearly important for the compiler to reason about, but; it is far too much to expect the compiler to accurately reason about control; dependencies between two calls. It is also very easy to accidentally forget; to drain an autorelease pool when using the manual API, and this can; significantly inflate the process's high-water-mark. The introduction of a; new scope is unfortunate but basically required for sane interaction with the; rest of the language. Not draining the pool during an unwind is apparently; required by the Objective-C exceptions implementation. .. _arc.misc.externally_retained:. Externally-Retained Variables; -----------------------------. In some situations, variables with strong ownership are considered; externally-retained by the implementation. This means that the variable is; retained elsewhere, and therefore the implementation can elide retaining and; releasing its value. Such a variable is implicitly ``const`` for safety. In; contrast with ``__unsafe_unretained``, an externally-retained variable still; behaves as a strong variable outside of initialization and destruction. For; instance, when an externally-retained variable is captured in a block the value; of the variable is retained and released on block capture and destruction. It; also affects C++ features such as lambda capture, ``decltype``, and template; argument deduction. Implicitly, the implementation assumes that the :ref:`self parameter in a; non-init method <arc.misc.self>` and the :ref:`variable in a for-in loop; <arc.misc.enumeration>` are externally-retained. Externally-retained semantics can also be opted into with the; ``objc_externally_retained`` attribute. This attribute can apply to strong local; variables, functions, methods, or blocks:. .. code-block:: objc. @class WobbleAmount;. @interface Widget : NSObject; -(void)wobble:(WobbleAmount *)amount;; @end. @implementation Widget. -(void)wobble:(WobbleAmount",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst

The ``self`` parameter variable of an non-init Objective-C method is considered; :ref:`externally-retained <arc.misc.externally_retained>` by the implementation.; It is undefined behavior, or at least dangerous, to cause an object to be; deallocated during a message send to that object. In an init method, ``self``; follows the :ref:``init family rules <arc.family.semantics.init>``. .. admonition:: Rationale. The cost of retaining ``self`` in all methods was found to be prohibitive, as; it tends to be live across calls, preventing the optimizer from proving that; the retain and release are unnecessary --- for good reason, as it's quite; possible in theory to cause an object to be deallocated during its execution; without this retain and release. Since it's extremely uncommon to actually; do so, even unintentionally, and since there's no natural way for the; programmer to remove this retain/release pair otherwise (as there is for; other parameters by, say, making the variable ``objc_externally_retained`` or; qualifying it with ``__unsafe_unretained``), we chose to make this optimizing; assumption and shift some amount of risk to the user. .. _arc.misc.enumeration:. Fast enumeration iteration variables; ------------------------------------. If a variable is declared in the condition of an Objective-C fast enumeration; loop, and the variable has no explicit ownership qualifier, then it is; implicitly :ref:`externally-retained <arc.misc.externally_retained>` so that; objects encountered during the enumeration are not actually retained and; released. .. admonition:: Rationale. This is an optimization made possible because fast enumeration loops promise; to keep the objects retained during enumeration, and the collection itself; cannot be synchronously modified. It can be overridden by explicitly; qualifying the variable with ``__strong``, which will make the variable; mutable again and cause the loop to retain the objects it e",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst

The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements.

For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document.

Failing to call ``[super dealloc]`` in such a; method is nearly always a bug. Sometimes, the object is simply trying to; prevent itself from being destroyed, but ``dealloc`` is really far too late; for the object to be raising such objections. Somewhat more legitimately, an; object may have been pool-allocated and should not be deallocated with; ``free``; for now, this can only be supported with a ``dealloc``; implementation outside of ARC. Such an implementation must be very careful; to do all the other work that ``NSObject``'s ``dealloc`` would, which is; outside the scope of this document to describe.

C++ Support; ===========. Within a block stack based C++ objects are copied into ``const`` copies using; the copy constructor. It is an error if a stack based C++ object is used within; a block if it does not have a copy constructor.

The copy helper should call the constructor using; appropriate offsets of the variable within the supplied stack based block source; and heap based destination for all ``const`` constructed copies, and similarly; should call the destructor in the destroy routine. As an example, suppose a C++ class ``FOO`` existed with a copy constructor.; Within a code block a stack version of a ``FOO`` object is declared and used; within a ``Block`` literal expression:. .. code-block:: c++. {; FOO foo;; void (^block)(void) = ^{ printf(""%d\n"", foo.value()); };; }.

Any variables used within; inner blocks are imported into all enclosing ``Block`` scopes even if the; variables are not used. This includes ``const`` imports as well as ``__block``; variables. Objective C Extensions to ``Blocks``; ====================================. Importing Objects; -----------------. Objects should be treated as ``__attribute__((NSObject))`` variables; all; ``copy_helper``, ``dispose_helper``, ``byref_keep``, and ``byref_dispose``; helper functions should use ``_Block_object_assign`` and; ``_Block_object_dispose``. There should be no code generated that uses; ``*-retain`` or ``*-release`` methods. ``Blocks`` as Objects; ---------------------. The compiler will treat ``Blocks`` as objects when synthesizing property setters; and getters, will characterize them as objects when generating garbage; collection strong and weak layout information in the same manner as objects, and; will issue strong and weak write-barrier assignments in the same manner as; objects. ``__weak __block`` Support; --------------------------. Objective-C (and Objective-C++) support the ``__weak`` attribute on ``__block``; variables. Under normal circumstances the compiler uses the Objective-C runtime; helper support functions ``objc_assign_weak`` and ``objc_read_weak``. Both; should continue to be used for all reads and writes of ``__weak __block``; variables:. .. code-block:: c. objc_read_weak(&block->byref_i->forwarding->i).

This document describes the Apple ABI implementation specification of Blocks. The first shipping version of this ABI is found in Mac OS X 10.6, and shall be; referred to as 10.6.ABI. As of 2010/3/16, the following describes the ABI; contract with the runtime and the compiler, and, as necessary, will be referred; to as ABI.2010.3.16. Since the Apple ABI references symbols from other elements of the system, any; attempt to use this ABI on systems prior to SnowLeopard is undefined. High Level; ==========. The ABI of ``Blocks`` consist of their layout and the runtime functions required; by the compiler. A ``Block`` of type ``R (^)(P...)`` consists of a structure of; the following form:. .. code-block:: c. struct Block_literal_1 {; void *isa; // initialized to &_NSConcreteStackBlock or &_NSConcreteGlobalBlock; int flags;; int reserved;; R (*invoke)(struct Block_literal_1 *, P...);; struct Block_descriptor_1 {; unsigned long int reserved; // NULL; unsigned long int size; // sizeof(struct Block_literal_1); // optional helper functions; void (*copy_helper)(void *dst, void *src); // IFF (1<<25); void (*dispose_helper)(void *src); // IFF (1<<25); // required ABI.2010.3.16; const char *signature; // IFF (1<<30); } *descriptor;; // imported vari",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.rst
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.rst:13807,Integrability,rout,routines,13807,". The ``flags`` field is set to either 0 if no helper functions are needed; or (1<<25) if they are. d. The helper functions are initialized (if present). e. The variable itself is set to its initial value. f. The ``isa`` field is set to ``NULL``. Access to ``__block`` variables from within its lexical scope; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In order to ""move"" the variable to the heap upon a ``copy_helper`` operation the; compiler must rewrite access to such a variable to be indirect through the; structures ``forwarding`` pointer. For example:. .. code-block:: c. int __block i = 10;; i = 11;. would be rewritten to be:. .. code-block:: c. struct _block_byref_i {; void *isa;; struct _block_byref_i *forwarding;; int flags; //refcount;; int size;; int captured_i;; } i = { NULL, &i, 0, sizeof(struct _block_byref_i), 10 };. i.forwarding->captured_i = 11;. In the case of a ``Block`` reference variable being marked ``__block`` the; helper code generated must use the ``_Block_object_assign`` and; ``_Block_object_dispose`` routines supplied by the runtime to make the; copies. For example:. .. code-block:: c. __block void (voidBlock)(void) = blockA;; voidBlock = blockB;. would translate into:. .. code-block:: c. struct _block_byref_voidBlock {; void *isa;; struct _block_byref_voidBlock *forwarding;; int flags; //refcount;; int size;; void (*byref_keep)(struct _block_byref_voidBlock *dst, struct _block_byref_voidBlock *src);; void (*byref_dispose)(struct _block_byref_voidBlock *);; void (^captured_voidBlock)(void);; };. void _block_byref_keep_helper(struct _block_byref_voidBlock *dst, struct _block_byref_voidBlock *src) {; //_Block_copy_assign(&dst->captured_voidBlock, src->captured_voidBlock, 0);; _Block_object_assign(&dst->captured_voidBlock, src->captured_voidBlock, BLOCK_FIELD_IS_BLOCK | BLOCK_BYREF_CALLER);; }. void _block_byref_dispose_helper(struct _block_byref_voidBlock *param) {; //_Block_destroy(param->captured_voidBlock, 0);; _Block_object",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.rst

C++ Support; ===========. Within a block stack based C++ objects are copied into ``const`` copies using; the copy constructor. It is an error if a stack based C++ object is used within; a block if it does not have a copy constructor. In addition both copy and; destroy helper routines must be synthesized for the block to support the; ``Block_copy()`` operation, and the flags work marked with the (1<<26) bit in; addition to the (1<<25) bit. The copy helper should call the constructor using; appropriate offsets of the variable within the supplied stack based block source; and heap based destination for all ``const`` constructed copies, and similarly; should call the destructor in the destroy routine.

Such objects (if not; ``const`` objects) must support a regular copy constructor. The ``block_byref``; data structure will have copy and destroy helper routines synthesized by the; compiler. The copy helper will have code created to perform the copy; constructor based on the initial stack ``block_byref`` data structure, and will; also set the (1<<26) bit in addition to the (1<<25) bit. The destroy helper; will have code to do the destructor on the object stored within the supplied; ``block_byref`` heap data structure.

C++ Support; ===========. Within a block stack based C++ objects are copied into ``const`` copies using; the copy constructor. It is an error if a stack based C++ object is used within; a block if it does not have a copy constructor. In addition both copy and; destroy helper routines must be synthesized for the block to support the; ``Block_copy()`` operation, and the flags work marked with the (1<<26) bit in; addition to the (1<<25) bit. The copy helper should call the constructor using; appropriate offsets of the variable within the supplied stack based block source; and heap based destination for all ``const`` constructed copies, and similarly; should call the destructor in the destroy routine. As an example, suppose a C++ class ``FOO`` existed with a copy constructor.; Within a code block a stack version of a ``FOO`` object is declared and used; within a ``Block`` literal expression:. .. code-block:: c++. {; FOO foo;; void (^block)(void) = ^{ printf(""%d\n"", foo.value()); };; }. The compiler would synthesize:. .. code-block:: c++. struct __block_literal_10 {; void *isa;; int flags;; int reserved;; void (*invoke)(struct __block_literal_10 *);; struct __block_descriptor_10 *descriptor;; const FOO foo;; };. void __block_invoke_10(struct __block_literal_10 *_block) {; printf(""%d\n"", _block->foo.value());; }. void __block_copy_10(struct __block_literal_10 *dst, struct __block_literal_10 *src) {; FOO_ctor(&dst->foo, &src->foo);; }. void __block_dispose_10(struct __block_literal_10 *src) {; FOO_dtor(&src->foo);; }. static struct __block_descriptor_10 {",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.rst

The following Block literal:. .. code-block:: c. ^ void (void) { printf(""hello world\n""); }. produces a reference to a Block with no arguments with no return value. The return type is optional and is inferred from the return; statements. If the return statements return a value, they all must; return a value of the same type. If there is no value returned the; inferred type of the Block is void; otherwise it is the type of the; return statement value. If the return type is omitted and the argument list is ``( void )``,; the ``( void )`` argument list may also be omitted.

Exceptions are treated *normally* in that when; thrown they pop stack frames until a catch clause is found. Objective-C Extensions; ======================.

All Blocks are constructed to be Objective-C objects regardless of; whether the Objective-C runtime is operational in the program or; not. Blocks using automatic (stack) memory are objects and may be; messaged, although they may not be assigned into ``__weak`` locations; if garbage collection is enabled. Within a Block literal expression within a method definition; references to instance variables are also imported into the lexical; scope of the compound statement. These variables are implicitly; qualified as references from self, and so self is imported as a const; copy. The net effect is that instance variables can be mutated. The :block-term:`Block_copy` operator retains all objects held in; variables of automatic storage referenced within the Block expression; (or form strong references if running under garbage collection).; Object variables of ``__block`` storage type are assumed to hold; normal pointers with ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst

An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration.

Annotation for pointers to a single object; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The C language allows pointer arithmetic on arbitrary pointers and this has been; a source of many bounds safety issues. In practice, many pointers are merely; pointing to a single object and incrementing or decrementing such a pointer; immediately makes the pointer go out-of-bounds. To prevent this unsafety,; ``-fbounds-safety`` provides the annotation ``__single`` that causes pointer; arithmetic on annotated pointers to be a compile time error. * ``__single`` : indicates that the pointer is either pointing to a single; object or null. Hence, pointers with ``__single`` do not permit pointer; arithmetic nor being subscripted with a non-zero index. Dereferencing a; ``__single`` pointer is allowed but it requires a null check. Upper and lower; bounds checks are not required because the ``__single`` pointer should point; to a valid object unless it's null. ``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers. This; gives strong security guarantees in that these pointers cannot be incremented or; decremented unless they have an explicit, overriding bounds annotation that can; be used to verify the safety of the operation.

A pointer type used in a C-style cast (e.g., ``(int *)src``) inherits the same; pointer attribute in the type of src. For instance, if the type of src is ``T; *__single`` (with ``T`` being an arbitrary C type), ``(int *)src`` will be ``int; *__single``. The reasoning behind this behavior is so that a C-style cast; doesn't introduce any unexpected side effects caused by an implicit cast of; bounds attribute. Pointer casts can have explicit bounds annotations. For instance, ``(int; *__bidi_indexable)src`` casts to ``int *__bidi_indexable`` as long as src has a; bounds annotation that can implicitly convert to ``__bidi_indexable``. If; ``src`` has type ``int *__single``, it can implicitly convert to ``int; *__bidi_indexable`` which then will have the upper bound pointing to one past; the first element. However, if src has type ``int *__unsafe_indexable``, the; explicit cast ``(int *__bidi_indexable)src`` will cause an error because; ``__unsafe_indexable`` cannot cast to ``__bidi_indexable`` as; ``__unsafe_indexable`` doesn't have bounds information. `Cast rules`_ describes; in more detail what kinds of casts are allowed between pointers with different; bounds annotations.

Pointer types in ``typedef``\s do not have implicit default bounds annotations.; Instead, the bounds annotation is determined when the ``typedef`` is used.

For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them. This prevents ``buf`` and; ``count`` from temporarily falling out of sync due to updates happening at a; distance. The example below shows a function ``alloc_buf`` that initializes a struct that; members that use the ``__counted_by`` annotation. The compiler allows these; assignments because ``sbuf->buf`` and ``sbuf->count`` are updated side by side; without any side effects in between the assignments. Furthermore, the compiler inserts additional run-time checks to ensure the new; ``buf`` has at least as many elements as the new ``count`` indicates as shown in; the transformed pseudo code of function ``alloc_buf()`` in the example below. .. code-block:: c. typedef",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

Two pointers that have different bounds annotations on their nested pointer; types are incompatible and cannot implicitly cast to each other. For example,; ``T *__single *__single`` cannot be converted to ``T *__bidi_indexable; *__single``. Such a conversion between incompatible nested bounds annotations; can be allowed using an explicit cast (e.g., C-style cast). Hereafter, the rules; only apply to the top pointer types. ``__unsafe_indexable`` cannot be converted; to any other safe pointer types (``__single``, ``__bidi_indexable``,; ``__counted_by``, etc) using a cast. The extension provides builtins to force; this conversion, ``__unsafe_forge_bidi_indexable(type, pointer, char_count)`` to; convert pointer to a ``__bidi_indexable`` pointer of type with ``char_count``; bytes available and ``__unsafe_forge_single(type, pointer)`` to convert pointer; to a single pointer of type type. The following examples show the usage of these; functions.

The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. vo",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

This is mainly used for; pointers to incomplete types or types without size such as ``void *``.; * ``__ended_by(P)`` : The pointer has the upper bound of value ``P``, which is; one past the last element of the pointer. In other words, this annotation; describes a range that starts with the pointer that has this annotation and; ends with ``P`` which is the argument of the annotation. ``P`` itself may be; annotated with ``__ended_by(Q)``. In this case, the end of the range extends; to the pointer ``Q``. This is used for ""iterator"" support in C where you're; iterating from one pointer value to another until a final pointer value is; reached (and the final pointer value is not dereferencable). Accessing a pointer outside the specified bounds causes a run-time trap or a; compile-time error. Also, the model maintains correctness of bounds annotations; when the pointer and/or the related value containing the bounds information are; updated or passed as arguments. This is done by compile-time restrictions or; run-time checks (see `Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations`_; for more detail). For instance, initializing ``buf`` with ``null`` while; assigning non-zero value to ``count``, as shown in the following example, would; violate the ``__counted_by`` annotation because a null pointer does not point to; any valid memory location. To avoid this, the compiler produces either a; compile-time error or run-time trap. .. code-block:: c. void null_with_count_10(int *__counted_by(count) buf, unsigned count) {; buf = 0;; // This is not allowed as it creates a null pointer with non-zero length; count = 10;; }. However, there are use cases where a pointer is either a null pointer or is; pointing to memory of the specified size.

Then, it's copied to ``int *p``, which is implicitly ``int; *__bidi_indexable p``. Please note that value of ``n`` used to create the upper; bound is ``10``, not ``100``, in this case because ``10`` is the actual length; of ``vla``, the value of ``n`` at the time when the array is being allocated. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void) {; int n = 10;; int vla[n];; n = 100;; int *p = vla; // { .ptr: &vla[0], .upper: &vla[10], .lower: &vla[0] }; // it's `&vla[10]` because the value of `n` was 10 at the; // time when the array is actually allocated.; // ...; }.

The ``-fbounds-safety`` extension offers bounds annotations that programmers can; use to attach bounds to pointers. For example, programmers can add the; ``__counted_by(N)`` annotation to parameter ``ptr``, indicating that the pointer; has ``N`` valid elements:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int *__counted_by(N) ptr, size_t N);. Using this bounds information, the compiler inserts bounds checks on every; pointer dereference, ensuring that the program does not access memory outside; the specified bounds.

Instead, ``__sized_by`` can be used to; describe the byte count.; * ``__sized_by(N)`` : The pointer points to memory that contains ``N`` bytes.; Just like the argument of ``__counted_by``, ``N`` is an expression of integer; type which can be a constant, a simple reference to a declaration, or an; arithmetic expression that does not have side effects. This is mainly used for; pointers to incomplete types or types without size such as ``void *``.; * ``__ended_by(P)`` : The pointer has the upper bound of value ``P``, which is; one past the last element of the pointer.

In this case, the end of the range extends; to the pointer ``Q``. This is used for ""iterator"" support in C where you're; iterating from one pointer value to another until a final pointer value is; reached (and the final pointer value is not dereferencable). Accessing a pointer outside the specified bounds causes a run-time trap or a; compile-time error. Also, the model maintains correctness of bounds annotations; when the pointer and/or the related value containing the bounds information are; updated or passed as arguments.

For instance, initializing ``buf`` with ``null`` while; assigning non-zero value to ``count``, as shown in the following example, would; violate the ``__counted_by`` annotation because a null pointer does not point to; any valid memory location.

When ``typeof()`` takes a type name, the compiler doesn't apply an implicit; bounds annotation on the named pointer types. For example, ``typeof(int*)``; returns ``int *`` without any bounds annotation. A bounds annotation may be; added after the fact depending on the context. In the following example,; ``typeof(int *)`` returns ``int *`` so it's equivalent as the local variable is; declared as ``int *l``, so it eventually becomes implicitly; ``__bidi_indexable``. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void) {; typeof(int *) l; // `int *__bidi_indexable` (same as `int *l`); }.

When ``sizeof()`` takes a type name, the compiler doesn't apply an implicit; bounds annotation on the named pointer types.

Therefore, ``sizeof(int*)`` remains the same with or without; ``-fbounds-safety``.

Similar to ``sizeof()`` and ``typeof``, the compiler doesn't apply; an implicit bounds annotation on the pointer types named inside ``alignof()``.; Therefore, ``alignof(T *)`` remains the same with or without; ``-fbounds-safety``, evaluating into the alignment of the raw pointer ``T *``.; The programmers can explicitly add a bounds annotation to the types, e.g.,; ``alignof(int *__bidi_indexable)``, which returns the alignment of ``int; *__bidi_indexable``. A bounds annotation including an internal bounds annotation; (i.e., ``__indexable`` and ``__bidi_indexable``) doesn't affect the alignment of; the original pointer. Therefore, ``alignof(int *__bidi_indexable)`` is equal to; ``alignof(int *)``. Default pointer types used in C-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A pointer type used in a C-style cast (e.g., ``(int *)src``) inherits the same; pointer attribute in the type of src. For instance, if the type of src is ``T; *__single`` (with ``T`` being an arbitrary C type), ``(int *)src`` will be ``int; *__single``. The reasoning behind this behavior is so that a C-style cast; doesn't introduce any unexpected side effects caused by an implicit cast of; bounds attribute. Pointer casts can have explicit bounds annotations. For instance, ``(int; *__bidi_indexable)src`` casts to ``int *__bidi_indexable`` as long as src has a; bounds annotation that can implicitly convert to ``__bidi_indexable``. If; ``src`` has type ``int *__single``, it can implicitly convert to ``int; *__bidi_indexable`` which then will have the upper bound pointing to one past; the first element. However, if src has type ``int *__unsafe_indexable``, the; explicit cast ``(int *__bidi_indexable)src`` will cause an error because; ``__unsafe_indexable`` cannot cast to ``__bidi_indexable`` as; ``__unsafe_indexable`` doesn't have bounds information. `Cast rules`_ des",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

Array to pointer promotion to secure arrays (including VLAs); ------------------------------------------------------------. Arrays on function prototypes; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, arrays on function prototypes are promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to; its first element (e.g., ``&arr[0]``). In ``-fbounds-safety``, arrays are also; decayed to pointers, but with the addition of an implicit bounds annotation,; which includes variable-length arrays (VLAs).

This means the array parameters are treated as `__counted_by` pointers within; the function and callers of the function also see them as the corresponding; `__counted_by` pointers.

Array references; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, similar to arrays on the function prototypes, a reference to array is; automatically promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to its first element (e.g.,; ``&arr[0]``). In `-fbounds-safety`, array references are promoted to ``__bidi_indexable``; pointers which contain the upper and lower bounds of the array, with the; equivalent of ``&arr[0]`` serving as the lower bound and ``&arr[array_size]``; (or one past the last element) serving as the upper bound. This applies to all; types of arrays including constant-length arrays, variable-length arrays (VLAs),; and flexible array members annotated with `__counted_by`. In the following example, reference to ``vla`` promotes to ``int; *__bidi_indexable``, with ``&vla[n]`` as the upper bound and ``&vla[0]`` as the; lower bound. Then, it's copied to ``int *p``, which is implicitly ``int; *__bidi_indexable p``.

In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking.

Hence, ``-fbounds-safety``; considers the outermost pointer types of local variables as non-ABI visible. The; rest of the pointers such as nested pointer types, pointer types of global; variables, struct fields, and function prototypes are considered ABI-visible. All ABI-visible pointers are treated as ``__single`` by default unless annotated; otherwise. This default both preserves ABI and makes these pointers safe by; default. This behavior can be controlled with macros, i.e.,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_*ATTR*()``, to set the default annotation for; ABI-visible pointers to be either ``__single``, ``__bidi_indexable``,; ``__indexable``, or ``__unsafe_indexable``. For instance,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_unsafe_indexable()`` will make all ABI-visible pointers; be ``__unsafe_indexable``.

For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them.

Furthermore, the compiler inserts additional run-time checks to ensure the new; ``buf`` has at least as many elements as the new ``count`` indicates as shown in; the transformed pseudo code of function ``alloc_buf()`` in the example below. .. code-block:: c. typedef struct {; int *__counted_by(count) buf;; size_t count;; } sized_buf_t;. void alloc_buf(sized_buf_t *sbuf, sized_t nelems) {; sbuf->buf = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * nelems);; sbuf->count = nelems;; }. // Transformed pseudo code:; void alloc_buf(sized_buf_t *sbuf, sized_t nelems) {; // Materialize RHS values:; int *tmp_ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * nelems);; int tmp_count = nelems;; // Inserted check:; // - checks to ensure that `lower <= tmp_ptr <= upper`; // - if (upper(tmp_ptr) - tmp_ptr < tmp_count) trap();; sbuf->buf = tmp_ptr;; sbuf->count = tmp_count;; }. Whether the compiler can optimize such run-time checks depends on how the upper; bound of the pointer is derived. If the source pointer has ``__sized_by``,; ``__counted_by``, or a variant of such, the compiler assumes that the upper; bound calculation doesn't overflow, e.g., ``ptr + size`` (where the type of; ``ptr`` is ``void *__sized_by(size)``), because when the ``__sized_by`` pointer; is initialized, ``-fbounds-safety`` inserts run-time checks to ensure that ``ptr; + size`` doesn't overflow and that ``size >= 0``. Assuming the upper bound calculation doesn't overflow, the compiler can simplify; the trap condition ``upper(tmp_ptr) - tmp_ptr < tmp_count`` to ``size <; tmp_count`` so if both ``size`` and ``tmp_count`` values are known at compile; time such that ``0 <= tmp_count <= size``, the optimizer can remove the check. ``ptr + size`` may still overflow if the ``__sized_by`` pointer is created from; code that doesn't enable ``-fbounds-safety``, which is undefined behavior.

Assuming the upper bound calculation doesn't overflow, the compiler can simplify; the trap condition ``upper(tmp_ptr) - tmp_ptr < tmp_count`` to ``size <; tmp_count`` so if both ``size`` and ``tmp_count`` values are known at compile; time such that ``0 <= tmp_count <= size``, the optimizer can remove the check. ``ptr + size`` may still overflow if the ``__sized_by`` pointer is created from; code that doesn't enable ``-fbounds-safety``, which is undefined behavior. In the previous code example with the transformed ``alloc_buf()``, the upper; bound of ``tmp_ptr`` is derived from ``void *__sized_by_or_null(size)``, which; is the return type of ``malloc()``. Hence, the pointer arithmetic doesn't; overflow or ``tmp_ptr`` is null. Therefore, if ``nelems`` was given as a; compile-time constant, the compiler could remove the checks.

Other potential applications of bounds annotations; ==================================================. The bounds annotations provided by the ``-fbounds-safety`` programming model; have potential use cases beyond the language extension itself. For example,; static and dynamic analysis tools could use the bounds information to improve; diagnostics for out-of-bounds accesses, even if ``-fbounds-safety`` is not used.; The bounds annotations could be used to improve C interoperability with; bounds-safe languages, providing a better mapping to bounds-safe types in the; safe language interface. The bounds annotations can also serve as documentation; specifying the relationship between declarations. Limitations; ===========. ``-fbounds-safety`` aims to bring the bounds safety guarantee to the C language,; and it does not guarantee other types of memory safety properties. Consequently,; it may not prevent some of the secondary bounds safety violations caused by; other types of safety violations such as type confusion. For instance,; ``-fbounds-safety`` does not perform type-safety checks on conversions between; `__single`` pointers of different pointee types (e.g., ``char *__single`` →; ``void *__single`` → ``int *__single``) beyond what the foundation languages; (C/C++) already offer. ``-fbounds-safety`` heavily relies on run-time checks to keep the bounds safety; and the soundness of the type system. This may incur significant code size; overhead in unoptimized builds and leaving some of the adoption mistakes to be; caught only at run time. This is not a fundamental limitation, however, because; incrementally adding necessary static analysis will allow us to catch issues; early on and remove unnecessary bounds checks in unoptimized builds.",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

ABI visibility and default annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Requiring ``-fbounds-safety`` adopters to add bounds annotations to all pointers; in the codebase would be a significant adoption burden. To avoid this and to; secure all pointers by default, ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds; annotations to pointer types.; Default annotations apply to pointer types of declarations. ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds annotations to pointer types used in; declarations. The default annotations are determined by the ABI visibility of; the pointer. A pointer type is ABI-visible if changing its size or; representation affects the ABI. For instance, changing the size of a type used; in a function parameter will affect the ABI and thus pointers used in function; parameters are ABI-visible pointers. On the other hand, changing the types of; local variables won't have such ABI implications. Hence, ``-fbounds-safety``; considers the outermost pointer types of local variables as non-ABI visible. The; rest of the pointers such as nested pointer types, pointer types of global; variables, struct fields, and function prototypes are considered ABI-visible. All ABI-visible pointers are treated as ``__single`` by default unless annotated; otherwise. This default both preserves ABI and makes these pointers safe by; default. This behavior can be controlled with macros, i.e.,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_*ATTR*()``, to set the default annotation for; ABI-visible pointers to be either ``__single``, ``__bidi_indexable``,; ``__indexable``, or ``__unsafe_indexable``. For instance,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_unsafe_indexable()`` will make all ABI-visible pointers; be ``__unsafe_indexable``.

ABI implications of default bounds annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Although simply modifying types of a local variable doesn't normally impact the; ABI, taking the address of such a modified type could create a pointer type that; has an ABI mismatch. Looking at the following example, ``int *local`` is; implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable`` and thus the type of ``&local`` is a; pointer to ``int *__bidi_indexable``. On the other hand, in ``void foo(int; **)``, the parameter type is a pointer to ``int *__single`` (i.e., ``void; foo(int *__single *__single)``) (or a pointer to ``int *__unsafe_indexable`` if; it's from a system header). The compiler reports an error for casts between; pointers whose elements have incompatible pointer attributes. This way,; ``-fbounds-safety`` prevents pointers that are implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``; from silently escaping thereby breaking the ABI. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int **);. void bar(void) {; int *local = 0;; // error: passing 'int *__bidi_indexable*__bidi_indexable' to parameter of; // incompatible nested pointer type 'int *__single*__single'; foo(&local);; }. A local variable may still be exposed to the ABI if ``typeof()`` takes the type; of local variable to define an interface as shown in the following example. .. code-block:: C. // bar.c; void bar(int *) { ... }. // foo.c; void foo(void) {; int *p; // implicitly `int *__bidi_indexable p`; extern void bar(typeof(p)); // creates an interface of type; // `void bar(int *__bidi_indexable)`; }. Doing this may break the ABI if the parameter is not ``__bidi_indexable`` at the; definition of function ``bar()`` which is likely the case because parameters are; ``__single`` by default without an explicit annotation.

Default pointer types in ``typeof()``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When ``typeof()`` takes an expression, it respects the bounds annotation on; the expression type, including the bounds annotation is implcit. For example,; the global variable ``g`` in the following code is implicitly ``__single`` so; ``typeof(g)`` gets ``char *__single``. The similar is true for the parameter; ``p``, so ``typeof(p)`` returns ``void *__single``. The local variable ``l`` is; implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``, so ``typeof(l)`` becomes; ``int *__bidi_indexable``. .. code-block:: C. char *g; // typeof(g) == char *__single. void foo(void *p) {; // typeof(p) == void *__single. int *l; // typeof(l) == int *__bidi_indexable; }.

A bounds annotation may be; added after the fact depending on the context. In the following example,; ``typeof(int *)`` returns ``int *`` so it's equivalent as the local variable is; declared as ``int *l``, so it eventually becomes implicitly; ``__bidi_indexable``. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void) {; typeof(int *) l; // `int *__bidi_indexable` (same as `int *l`); }. The programmers can still explicitly add a bounds annotation on the types named; inside ``typeof``, e.g., ``typeof(int *__bidi_indexable)``, which evaluates to; ``int *__bidi_indexable``. Default pointer types in ``sizeof()``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When ``sizeof()`` takes a type name, the compiler doesn't apply an implicit; bounds annotation on the named pointer types. This means if a bounds annotation; is not specified, the evaluated pointer type is treated identically to a plain C; pointer type. Therefore, ``sizeof(int*)`` remains the same with or without; ``-fbounds-safety``. That said, programmers can explicitly add attribute to the; types, e.g., ``sizeof(int *__bidi_indexable)``, in which case the sizeof; evaluates to the size of type ``int *__bidi_indexable`` (the value equivalent to; ``3 * sizeof(int*)``). When ``sizeof()`` takes an expression, i.e., ``sizeof(expr``, it behaves as; ``sizeof(typeof(expr))``, except that ``sizeof(expr)`` does not report an error; with ``expr`` that has a type with an external bounds annotation dependent on; another declaration, whereas ``typeof()`` on the same expression would be an; error as described in :ref:`Default pointer types in typeof`.; The following example describes this behavior. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int *__counted_by(size) p, size_t size) {; // sizeof(p) == sizeof(int *__counted_by(size)) == sizeof(int *); // typeof(p): error; };.

Default pointer types in ``alignof()``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``alignof()`` only takes a type name as the argument and it doesn't take an; expression. Similar to ``sizeof()`` and ``typeof``, the compiler doesn't apply; an implicit bounds annotation on the pointer types named inside ``alignof()``.; Therefore, ``alignof(T *)`` remains the same with or without; ``-fbounds-safety``, evaluating into the alignment of the raw pointer ``T *``.; The programmers can explicitly add a bounds annotation to the types, e.g.,; ``alignof(int *__bidi_indexable)``, which returns the alignment of ``int; *__bidi_indexable``. A bounds annotation including an internal bounds annotation; (i.e., ``__indexable`` and ``__bidi_indexable``) doesn't affect the alignment of; the original pointer. Therefore, ``alignof(int *__bidi_indexable)`` is equal to; ``alignof(int *)``. Default pointer types used in C-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A pointer type used in a C-style cast (e.g., ``(int *)src``) inherits the same; pointer attribute in the type of src. For instance, if the type of src is ``T; *__single`` (with ``T`` being an arbitrary C type), ``(int *)src`` will be ``int; *__single``. The reasoning behind this behavior is so that a C-style cast; doesn't introduce any unexpected side effects caused by an implicit cast of; bounds attribute.

The; following example shows that no pointer annotation is specified in the ``typedef; pint_t`` while each instance of ``typedef``'ed pointer gets its bounds; annotation based on the context in which the type is used. .. code-block:: c. typedef int * pint_t; // int *. pint_t glob; // int *__single glob;. void foo(void) {; pint_t local; // int *__bidi_indexable local;; }. Pointer types in a ``typedef`` can still have explicit annotations, e.g.,; ``typedef int *__single``, in which case the bounds annotation ``__single`` will; apply to every use of the ``typedef``. Array to pointer promotion to secure arrays (including VLAs); ------------------------------------------------------------. Arrays on function prototypes; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, arrays on function prototypes are promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to; its first element (e.g., ``&arr[0]``). In ``-fbounds-safety``, arrays are also; decayed to pointers, but with the addition of an implicit bounds annotation,; which includes variable-length arrays (VLAs). As shown in the following example,; arrays on function prototypes are decalyed to corresponding ``__counted_by``; pointers. .. code-block:: c. // Function prototype: void foo(int n, int *__counted_by(n) arr);; void foo(int n, int arr[n]);. // Function prototype: void bar(int *__counted_by(10) arr);; void bar(int arr[10]);. This means the array parameters are treated as `__counted_by` pointers within; the function and callers of the function also see them as the corresponding; `__counted_by` pointers. Incomplete arrays on function prototypes will cause a compiler error unless it; has ``__counted_by`` annotation in its bracket. .. code-block:: c. void f1(int n, int arr[]); // error. void f3(int n, int arr[__counted_by(n)]); // ok. void f2(int n, int arr[n]); // ok, decays to int *__counted_by(n). void f4(int n, int *__counted_by(n) arr); // ok. void f5(int n, int *arr); // ok, but decays to int *__single,;",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

Array references; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, similar to arrays on the function prototypes, a reference to array is; automatically promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to its first element (e.g.,; ``&arr[0]``). In `-fbounds-safety`, array references are promoted to ``__bidi_indexable``; pointers which contain the upper and lower bounds of the array, with the; equivalent of ``&arr[0]`` serving as the lower bound and ``&arr[array_size]``; (or one past the last element) serving as the upper bound. This applies to all; types of arrays including constant-length arrays, variable-length arrays (VLAs),; and flexible array members annotated with `__counted_by`. In the following example, reference to ``vla`` promotes to ``int; *__bidi_indexable``, with ``&vla[n]`` as the upper bound and ``&vla[0]`` as the; lower bound. Then, it's copied to ``int *p``, which is implicitly ``int; *__bidi_indexable p``. Please note that value of ``n`` used to create the upper; bound is ``10``, not ``100``, in this case because ``10`` is the actual length; of ``vla``, the value of ``n`` at the time when the array is being allocated. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void) {; int n = 10;; int vla[n];; n = 100;; int *p = vla; // { .ptr: &vla[0], .upper: &vla[10], .lower: &vla[0] }; // it's `&vla[10]` because the value of `n` was 10 at the; // time when the array is actual",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking.

A pointer with the ``__unsafe_indexable`` annotation behaves the same as a plain; C pointer. That is, the pointer does not have any bounds information and pointer; operations are not checked. ``__unsafe_indexable`` can be used to mark pointers from system headers or; pointers from code that has not adopted -fbounds safety.

Requiring ``-fbounds-safety`` adopters to add bounds annotations to all pointers; in the codebase would be a significant adoption burden. To avoid this and to; secure all pointers by default, ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds; annotations to pointer types.; Default annotations apply to pointer types of declarations. ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds annotations to pointer types used in; declarations. The default annotations are determined by the ABI visibility of; the pointer. A pointer type is ABI-visible if changing its size or; representation affects the ABI. For instance, changing the size of a type used; in a function parameter will affect the ABI and thus pointers used in function; parameters are ABI-visible pointers. On the other hand, changing the types of; local variables won't have such ABI implications. Hence, ``-fbounds-safety``; considers the outermost pointer types of local variables as non-ABI visible. The; rest of the pointers such as nested pointer types, pointer types of global; variables, struct fields, and function prototypes are considered ABI-visible. All ABI-visible pointers are treated as ``__single`` by default unless annotated; otherwise.

Looking at the following example, ``int *local`` is; implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable`` and thus the type of ``&local`` is a; pointer to ``int *__bidi_indexable``. On the other hand, in ``void foo(int; **)``, the parameter type is a pointer to ``int *__single`` (i.e., ``void; foo(int *__single *__single)``) (or a pointer to ``int *__unsafe_indexable`` if; it's from a system header). The compiler reports an error for casts between; pointers whose elements have incompatible pointer attributes. This way,; ``-fbounds-safety`` prevents pointers that are implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``; from silently escaping thereby breaking the ABI. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int **);. void bar(void) {; int *local = 0;; // error: passing 'int *__bidi_indexable*__bidi_indexable' to parameter of; // incompatible nested pointer type 'int *__single*__single'; foo(&local);; }. A local variable may still be exposed to the ABI if ``typeof()`` takes the type; of local variable to define an interface as shown in the following example. .. code-block:: C. // bar.c; void bar(int *) { ... }. // foo.c; void foo(void) {; int *p; // implicitly `int *__bidi_indexable p`; extern void bar(typeof(p)); // creates an interface of type; // `void bar(int *__bidi_indexable)`; }. Doing this may break the ABI if the parameter is not ``__bidi_indexable`` at the; definition of function ``bar()`` which is likely the case because parameters are; ``__single`` by default without an explicit annotation. In order to avoid an implicitly wide pointer from silently breaking the ABI, the; compiler reports a warning when ``typeof()`` is used on an implicit wide pointer; at any ABI visible context (e.g., function prototype, struct definition, etc.). .. _Default pointer types in typeof:.

Default pointer types in typedef; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Pointer types in ``typedef``\s do not have implicit default bounds annotations.; Instead, the bounds annotation is determined when the ``typedef`` is used. The; following example shows that no pointer annotation is specified in the ``typedef; pint_t`` while each instance of ``typedef``'ed pointer gets its bounds; annotation based on the context in which the type is used. .. code-block:: c. typedef int * pint_t; // int *. pint_t glob; // int *__single glob;. void foo(void) {; pint_t local; // int *__bidi_indexable local;; }.

In C, arrays on function prototypes are promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to; its first element (e.g., ``&arr[0]``). In ``-fbounds-safety``, arrays are also; decayed to pointers, but with the addition of an implicit bounds annotation,; which includes variable-length arrays (VLAs).

This applies to all; types of arrays including constant-length arrays, variable-length arrays (VLAs),; and flexible array members annotated with `__counted_by`. In the following example, reference to ``vla`` promotes to ``int; *__bidi_indexable``, with ``&vla[n]`` as the upper bound and ``&vla[0]`` as the; lower bound. Then, it's copied to ``int *p``, which is implicitly ``int; *__bidi_indexable p``. Please note that value of ``n`` used to create the upper; bound is ``10``, not ``100``, in this case because ``10`` is the actual length; of ``vla``, the value of ``n`` at the time when the array is being allocated. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void) {; int n = 10;; int vla[n];; n = 100;; int *p = vla; // { .ptr: &vla[0], .upper: &vla[10], .lower: &vla[0] }; // it's `&vla[10]` because the value of `n` was 10 at the; // time when the array is actually allocated.; // ...; }. By promoting array references to ``__bidi_indexable``, all array accesses are; bounds checked in ``-fbounds-safety``, just as ``__bidi_indexable`` pointers; are. Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations; ---------------------------------------------. ``-fbounds-safety`` maintains correctness of bounds annotations by performing; additional checks when a pointer object and/or its related value containing the; bounds information is updated. For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

For example, the toolchain not; supporting this extension may not have a header defining ``__counted_by``, so; the code using ``__counted_by`` must define it as nothing or include a header; that has the define. .. code-block:: c. #if defined(__has_feature) && __has_feature(bounds_safety); #define __counted_by(T) __attribute__((__counted_by__(T))); // ... other bounds annotations; #else #define __counted_by(T) // defined as nothing; // ... other bounds annotations; #endif. // expands to `void foo(int * ptr, size_t count);`; // when extension is not enabled or not available; void foo(int *__counted_by(count) ptr, size_t count);. Other potential applications of bounds annotations; ==================================================. The bounds annotations provided by the ``-fbounds-safety`` programming model; have potential use cases beyond the language extension itself. For example,; static and dynamic analysis tools could use the bounds information to improve; diagnostics for out-of-bounds accesses, even if ``-fbounds-safety`` is not used.; The bounds annotations could be used to improve C interoperability with; bounds-safe languages, providing a better mapping to bounds-safe types in the; safe language interface. The bounds annotations can also serve as documentation; specifying the relationship between declarations. Limitations; ===========. ``-fbounds-safety`` aims to bring the bounds safety guarantee to the C language,; and it does not guarantee other types of memory safety properties. Consequently,; it may not prevent some of the secondary bounds safety violations caused by; other types of safety violations such as type confusion. For instance,; ``-fbounds-safety`` does not perform type-safety checks on conversions between; `__single`` pointers of different pointee types (e.g., ``char *__single`` →; ``void *__single`` → ``int *__single``) beyond what the foundation languages; (C/C++) already offer. ``-fbounds-safety`` heavily rel",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst

In the following example, ``__counted_by(count)``; annotation expresses the bounds of parameter p using another parameter count.; This model works naturally with many C interfaces and structs because the bounds; of a pointer is often available adjacent to the pointer itself, e.g., at another; parameter of the same function prototype, or at another field of the same struct; declaration. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; // off-by-one error; for (size_t i = 0; i <= count; ++i); p[i] = i;; }.

ABI implications of default bounds annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Although simply modifying types of a local variable doesn't normally impact the; ABI, taking the address of such a modified type could create a pointer type that; has an ABI mismatch. Looking at the following example, ``int *local`` is; implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable`` and thus the type of ``&local`` is a; pointer to ``int *__bidi_indexable``. On the other hand, in ``void foo(int; **)``, the parameter type is a pointer to ``int *__single`` (i.e., ``void; foo(int *__single *__single)``) (or a pointer to ``int *__unsafe_indexable`` if; it's from a system header). The compiler reports an error for casts between; pointers whose elements have incompatible pointer attributes. This way,; ``-fbounds-safety`` prevents pointers that are implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``; from silently escaping thereby breaking the ABI. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int **);. void bar(void) {; int *local = 0;; // error: passing 'int *__bidi_indexable*__bidi_indexable' to parameter of; // incompatible nested pointer type 'int *__single*__single'; foo(&local);; }.

Whether the compiler can optimize such run-time checks depends on how the upper; bound of the pointer is derived. If the source pointer has ``__sized_by``,; ``__counted_by``, or a variant of such, the compiler assumes that the upper; bound calculation doesn't overflow, e.g., ``ptr + size`` (where the type of; ``ptr`` is ``void *__sized_by(size)``), because when the ``__sized_by`` pointer; is initialized, ``-fbounds-safety`` inserts run-time checks to ensure that ``ptr; + size`` doesn't overflow and that ``size >= 0``. Assuming the upper bound calculation doesn't overflow, the compiler can simplify; the trap condition ``upper(tmp_ptr) - tmp_ptr < tmp_count`` to ``size <; tmp_count`` so if both ``size`` and ``tmp_count`` values are known at compile; time such that ``0 <= tmp_count <= size``, the optimizer can remove the check. ``ptr + size`` may still overflow if the ``__sized_by`` pointer is created from; code that doesn't enable ``-fbounds-safety``, which is undefined behavior. In the previous code example with the transformed ``alloc_buf()``, the upper; bound of ``tmp_ptr`` is derived from ``void *__sized_by_or_null(size)``, which; is the return type of ``malloc()``. Hence, the pointer arithmetic doesn't; overflow or ``tmp_ptr`` is null. Therefore, if ``nelems`` was given as a; compile-time constant, the compiler could remove the checks. Cast rules; ----------. ``-fbounds-safety`` does not enforce overall type safety and bounds invariants; can still be violated by incorrect casts in some cases.

For instance,; a pointer dereference on a ``__bidi_indexable`` pointer will return the; dereferenced value same as plain C pointers, modulo the extra bounds checks; being performed before dereferencing the wide pointer. This means mapping the; wide pointers to struct types with equivalent layout won’t be sufficient. To; represent the wide pointers in Clang AST, we add an extra field in the; PointerType class to indicate the internal bounds of the pointer. This ensures; pointers of different representations are mapped to different canonical types; while they are still treated as pointers. In LLVM IR, wide pointers will be emitted as structs of equivalent; representations. Clang CodeGen will handle them as Aggregate in; ``TypeEvaluationKind (TEK)``. ``AggExprEmitter`` was extended to handle pointer; operations returning wide pointers.

To implement this rule, the compiler requires a linear representation of; statements to understand the ordering and the adjacency between the two or more; assignments. The Clang CFG is used to implement this analysis as Clang CFG; provides a linear view of statements within each ``CFGBlock`` (Clang; ``CFGBlock`` represents a single basic block in a source-level CFG). Bounds check optimizations; ==========================. In ``-fbounds-safety``, the Clang frontend emits run-time checks for every; memory dereference if the type system or analyses in the frontend couldn’t; verify its bounds safety. The implementation relies on LLVM optimizations to; remove redundant run-time checks. Using this optimization strategy, if the; original source code already has bounds checks, the fewer additional checks; ``-fbounds-safety`` will introduce. The LLVM ``ConstraintElimination`` pass is; design to remove provable redundant checks (please check Florian Hahn’s; presentation in 2021 LLVM Dev Meeting and the implementation to learn more). In; the following example, ``-fbounds-safety`` implicitly adds the redundant bounds; checks that the optimizer can remove:. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; // implicit bounds checks:; // if (p + i < p || p + i + 1 > p + count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. ``ConstraintElimination`` collects the following facts and determines if the; bounds checks can be safely removed:. * Inside the for-loop, ``0 <= i < count``, hence ``1 <= i + 1 <= count``.; * Pointer arithmetic ``p + count`` in the if-condition doesn’t wrap.; * ``-fbounds-safety`` treats pointer arithmetic overflow as deterministically; two’s complement computation, not an undefined behavior. Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``_",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst

However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count.

It; has the capability to report on checks that it cannot eliminate, possibly with; reasons, allowing programmers to adjust their code to unlock further; optimizations. Debugging; =========. Internal bounds annotations; ---------------------------. Internal bounds annotations change a pointer into a wide pointer. The debugger; needs to understand that wide pointers are essentially pointers with a struct; layout. To handle this, a wide pointer is described as a record type in the; debug info. The type name has a special name prefix (e.g.,; ``__bounds_safety$bidi_indexable``) which can be recognized by a debug info; consumer to provide support that goes beyond showing the internal structure of; the wide pointer.
