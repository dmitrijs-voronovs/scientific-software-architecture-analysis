How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest.

Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself .; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer.

More detail is given here.; >>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -S. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; # make; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install; # -or- general; >>> cmake --build objdir --target install -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++17 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.8+) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.15+) https://cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) https://numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make and GNU install or Ninja, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library.

How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:. Ubuntu gfortran; conda gfortran_linux-64 or gfortran_osx-64 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gfortran_osx-64 conda package. This provides; gfortran compilers for Mac. The version is 4.8.5, which is quite old,; but the Fortran compiler will work.

How to handle “runtime library may be hidden” when building with Anaconda Python¶; When building against Ana/Miniconda python (e.g., cmake; -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/conda/bin/python), the warning below often; appears.

Some of these libraries may not be found correctly. How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files.

It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See setup at How to configure paths for PsiAPI; if needed.); # smoke tests only; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test('smoke')""; # most tests; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test()"".

It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake. Pass; the path containing that file to PSI4‘s CMake as; -DAddon_DIR=/path/to/config/usually/ending/in/share/cmake/AddON; and build PSI4. The main core.so should be dynamically linked; to your dev AddOn dynamic lib and update automatically when you rebuild; the AddOn lib. Naturally, you may need to delete core.so and remake; as needed. How to use logging in Psi4¶; A log file is generated alongside the output file and has extension; .log. Selected key information is sent to it.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always n",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/build_planning.html

How to get a Psi4 logo file¶; All image files are stored in https://github.com/psi4/psi4media. How to use a local Add-On repository in the Psi4 build¶; For each Add-On, PSI4 pulls source from a specific online Git; repository and a specific tag/branch/commit in it. This ensures success; of the PSI4 build, reproducibility of the runtime results, and; freedom for continued upstream development. Sometimes, you’re the one; doing that development, and you need the CMake superbuild to pull source; from a local path rather than the approved codeset.; Find the CMakeLists.txt governing the target Add-On in; psi4/external and make changes analogous to the below:; #GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/jturney/ambit; #GIT_TAG 1.0; DOWNLOAD_COMMAND """"; SOURCE_DIR ""/path/to/ambit-directclone"".

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers. How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; she",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/build_planning.html

Capabilities and Alternate Implementations¶; Depending on the reference (e.g., RHF, UHF, ROHF), the integral treatment; (conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),; active orbitals, and derivative level, computational methods are; sometimes assembled from implementations by multiple coders. Conversely,; some capabilities may be implemented multiple times. Capabilities,; modules, algorithm types, and defaults are detailed for many ground-state; methods at Table Module Capabilities. Its; analogous summary table (with modules collapsed) is at Summary; Capabilities. PSI4 transparently selects the; most efficient implementation, so one generally needn’t consult this; table. However, to understand the details of what combinations are; accessible or what alternate implementations are available, read on.; Note that HF, DFT, and MPn (n<=3); default to density-fitted integrals, while all higher methods default to; conventional integrals.

Capabilities and Alternate Implementations¶; Depending on the reference (e.g., RHF, UHF, ROHF), the integral treatment; (conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),; active orbitals, and derivative level, computational methods are; sometimes assembled from implementations by multiple coders. Conversely,; some capabilities may be implemented multiple times. Capabilities,; modules, algorithm types, and defaults are detailed for many ground-state; methods at Table Module Capabilities. Its; analogous summary table (with modules collapsed) is at Summary; Capabilities. PSI4 transparently selects the; most efficient implementation, so one generally needn’t consult this; table. However, to understand the details of what combinations are; accessible or what alternate implementations are available, read on.; Note that HF, DFT, and MPn (n<=3); default to density-fitted integrals, while all higher methods default to; conventional integrals. Therefore, for a closed-shell molecule:; # runs MP2 with default algorithm type ``DF`` with default implementation DFMP2; energy('mp2'). # runs MP2 with algorithm type ``CONV`` with default implementation OCC; set mp2_type conv; energy('mp2'). # runs MP2 with default algorithm type ``DF`` with implementation OCC; set qc_module occ; energy('mp2'). # runs MP2 with algorithm type ``CONV`` with implementation FNOCC; set mp2_type conv; set qc_module fnocc; energy('mp2'). Capabilities of PSI4, including details of overlapping modules. “✓” runs analytically. “∷” runs derivative with internal finite difference. Single underline “✓̲” or “∷̲” is default module when QC_MODULE unspecified. Double underline “✓̳” or “∷̳” is default algorithm type when type selector (e.g., CC_TYPE) unspecified.¶. ◻; ◻; name ↓ →; type[1] ↓ →; ◻.

Energy MethodsThe presence of a stage_wfn keyword is the indicator to incorporate; (and check for stage_basis and stage_scheme keywords) and compute; that stage in defining the CBS energy.; The cbs() function requires, at a minimum, name='scf' and scf_basis; keywords to be specified for reference-step only jobs and name and; corl_basis keywords for correlated jobs.; The following energy methods have been set up for cbs(). scf; hf; mp2; mp2.5; mp3; mp4(sdq); mp4; mpn. omp2; omp2.5; omp3; olccd; lccd; lccsd; cepa(0); cepa(1). cepa(3); acpf; aqcc; qcisd; cc2; ccsd; fno-ccsd; bccd. cc3; qcisd(t); ccsd(t); fno-ccsd(t); bccd(t); cisd; cisdt. cisdtq; cin; fci; mrccsd; mrccsd(t); mrccsdt; mrccsdt(q). Parameters:. name (str) – 'scf' || 'ccsd' || etc.; First argument, usually unlabeled.

Overruled if stage_wfn keywords supplied. scf_wfn (str) – \(\Rightarrow\) 'scf' \(\Leftarrow\) || 'c4-scf' || etc.; Indicates the energy method for which the reference energy is to be; obtained. Generally unnecessary, as ‘scf’ is the scf in PSI4 but; can be used to direct lone scf components to run in PSI4 or Cfour; in a mixed-program composite method. corl_wfn (str) – 'mp2' || 'ccsd(t)' || etc.; Indicates the energy method for which the correlation energy is to be; obtained. Can also be specified with name or as the unlabeled; first argument to the function. delta_wfn (str) – 'ccsd' || 'ccsd(t)' || etc.; Indicates the (superior) energy method for which a delta correction; to the correlation energy is to be obtained. delta_wfn_lesser (str) – \(\Rightarrow\) corl_wfn \(\Leftarrow\) || 'mp2' || etc.; Indicates the inferior energy method for which a delta correction; to the correlation energy is to be obtained. delta2_",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/cbs.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/cbs.html

REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2. CACHETYPE¶. Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted.

Basic Keywords¶; A complete list of keywords related to coupled-cluster computations is; provided in the appendices, with the majority of the relevant; keywords appearing in Appendix CCENERGY. For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems.

Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted. Type: string; Possible Values: LOW, LRU; Default: LOW. NUM_AMPS_PRINT¶. Number of important \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes to print. Type: integer; Default: 10. MP2_AMPS_PRINT¶. Do print the MP2 amplitudes which are the starting guesses for RHF and UHF reference functions?. Type: boolean; Default: false. Larger Calculations¶; Here are a few recommendations for carrying out large-basis-set coupled; cluster calculations with PSI4:. In most cases it is reasonable to set the memory keyword to 90% of; the available physical memory, at most. There is a small amount of overhead; associated with the; coupled cluster modules that is not accounted for by the internal CC memory; handling routines. Thus, the user should not specify the entire; physical memory of the system, or swapping is likely. However, for especially large; calculations, it is better to set the memory keyword to a value less than 16 GB.; Set the CACHELEVEL keyword to 0.; This will turn off cacheing, which, for very large calculations, can; lead to heap fragmentation and memory faults, even when sufficient; physical memory exists.; Set the PRINT keyword to 2. This; will help narrow where memory bottlenecks or other errors exist in the; event of a crash. Excited State Coupled Cluster Calculations¶; A complete list of keywords related to; coupled cluster linear response is provided in Appendix CCEOM.; The most important keywords associated with EOM-CC calculations are:.

Type: string; Possible Values: POLARIZABILITY, ROTATION, ROA, ROA_TENSOR, ALL; Default: POLARIZABILITY. OMEGA¶. Array that specifies the desired frequencies of the incident radiation field in CCLR calculations. If only one element is given, the units will be assumed to be atomic units. If more than one element is given, then the units must be specified as the final element of the array. Acceptable units are HZ, NM, EV, and AU. Type: array; Default: No Default. GAUGE¶. Specifies the choice of representation of the electric dipole operator. For polarizability, this keyword is ignored and LENGTH gauge is computed. For optical rotation and raman optical activity, this keyword is active, and acceptable values are LENGTH for the usual length-gauge representation, VELOCITY``(default) for the modified velocity-gauge representation in which the static-limit optical rotation tensor is subtracted from the frequency- dependent tensor, or ``BOTH.

Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems.

CACHETYPE¶. Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities.

To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file.

This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface.

Functionality¶; Through clever use of the cfour {...} block, one could run most any; Cfour computation through the P4C4 interface.

Specifying anything in PSI4 format (molecule, basis, options,; method call) starts building a *CFOUR(...) directive for the; ZMAT file. Since the contents of the cfour {...} block are; blindly appended to any input interpreted from PSI4 format, mixing; of PSI4 and Cfour input formats likely will give rise to multiple; *CFOUR(...) directives in the prospective ZMAT, execution of; which will be trapped and halted. Proper uses for the cfour {...}; block are for the sandwich mode, where the entire ZMAT is enclosed,; or for extra directives like %excite*, which presently have no other; specification route.; Specifying the basis is perhaps the regulated piece of input.

Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL).; Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked.

Specifying certain keywords that are nominally applicable for pure-PSI4 modules directs them to fulfil analogous roles; in the Cfour program (e.g., MAXITER is used to set; CFOUR_SCF_MAXCYC).

R=1.008; A=105.0. *ACES2(CALC=HF,BASIS=qz2p; MULT=2,REF=UHF; OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/3-0-1-0; SCF_CONV=12; MEMORY=20000000); }. energy('cfour'). Here, the contents of the cfour {...} block are written directly to a; ZMAT file. This is joined by a default GENBAS file; (psi4/psi4/share/psi4/basis/GENBAS). To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file. See Output for; details. This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface. We’ll call; this mode of basic utility the “sandwich” mode.; Molecule specification in PSI4 allows Cartesians, Z-matrices, mixed; Cartesian/Z-matrix, negation of variables, delayed specification of; variables, specification of fragments, etc., all in a whitespace-tolerant; format. See Molecule and Geometry Specification for details and; cfour/mints5 for examples. When a PSI4-style molecule is; supplied, its geometry is written to ZMAT in Cartesian form and the; CFOUR_COORDINATES=CARTESIAN, CFOUR_UNITS=ANGSTROM,; CFOUR_CHARGE, and CFOUR_MULTIPLICITY keywords are set; appropriately in the *CFOUR(...) directive.

In order to function; correctly, the Cfour executable xcfour must be present in; PATH or PSIPATH.

Here, note that none of capitalization, equals sign, or whitespace matter; for the keyword commands. Specification of strings and integers requires no; translation; booleans have extended freedom of; format; arrays must be translated into Python-style (square-bracket; bounded and comma delimited) of appropriate dimension. There are many; sample inputs in psi4/tests/cfour/ starting with sp- that take; examples from the Cfour manual and first run them in sandwich mode and; then run them as translated into PSI4 format. Note; PSI4 only recognizes keywords by their full name, so the common; Cfour keyword abbreviations CALC, REF, etc. must be replaced by their; proper names of CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL, CFOUR_REFERENCE, etc. Whenever the molecule is supplied in PSI4 format, it is possible to; perform geometry optimizations where Cfour supplies the gradient and the; PSI4 module optking drives the structural; changes. Because of the limitations on geometry specification for; optimizations in Cfour, optking-driven optimizations are the only; optimizations allowed in the P4C4 interface. (The exception is sandwich; mode, which, of course, permits optimizations with the Cfour optimizer.); Below is an example of a geometry optimization:; memory 200 mb. molecule {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A.

Note that due to the input parser’s; aggression, blank lines need to be replaced by the text blankline. Functionality¶; Through clever use of the cfour {...} block, one could run most any; Cfour computation through the P4C4 interface.

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs. If; there is both a PSI4 molecule and a molecule in the cfour block,; ZMAT will end up with multiple molecules and multiple *CFOUR(...); blocks, and it will not run. Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules. If necessary, clear the cfour block with cfour {} before; commencing standard P4C4 jobs. Output¶; The output of xcfour invoked from a PSI4 input file is; written to the PSI4 output file as the computation progresses.

Specification Details¶; The above narrative introduction to the P4C4 interface should be; sufficient to get started. Issues of competition between PSI4 and; Cfour specification format are generally resolved behind the scenes:; not according to a simple rule but according to sensible, sometimes; intricate, rules governed by user intent (and integration of Cfour to; behave like a PSI4 module). Much can be gleaned by just running; inputs and inspecting the ZMAT passed to Cfour, but when questions; arise, here are the specifics, the governing laws. Specifying a piece of input in PSI4 format is entering into; a contract that you mean it. In particular this applies to; molecule (including charge/multiplicity through molecule; optional_molecule_name {...}), memory (through memory; value unit), computational method (through . If Cfour keywords; are specified with values that contradict the PSI4 input,; execution is halted.; As an example, the input below is set up to fail in four ways:; contradictory specification of memory, multiplicity, computational; method, and derivative level. Note, though, that the cfour_units; angstrom setting is permissible, since it concurs with the value; implied in the molecule block.; memory 300 mb. molecule {; H;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/cfour.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/cfour.html

The only exceptions are the orbital space; PSI4 keywords RESTRICTED_DOCC (formerly; CheMPS2 used FROZEN_DOCC, contrary to its; definition) and ACTIVE which are passed along to; CheMPS2 keywords NOCC and NACT. A translation table; is available. Installation¶; Binary. CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code.

Detailed Installation of Miniconda¶; https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. Detailed Installation of PSI4¶. Subscribe to PSI4. Subscribe to our channel at https://anaconda.org/psi4 that contains the PSI4 package and several dependency packages. Make sure this shows up in your ~/.condarc file. >>> conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/psi4; # check; >>> cat ~/.condarc; channels:; - http://conda.anaconda.org/psi4; - defaults. Install PSI4. You can install into the main conda environment so that whenever commands conda or (Ana/Miniconda’s) python are available, then psi4 is available, too. >>> conda install psi4; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/bin/psi4. Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4. Configure environment. Preceding steps have placed conda and psi4 in your PATH, either permanently through rc-files or temporarily in this terminal session. You can keep or undo these changes.

Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc..

Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\), together; with the total density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\),; and the spin density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\).

The script is located; in psi4/psi4/share/psi4/scripts/vmd_cube.py. Script Prerequisites¶. VMD must be installed, and it can be downloaded for free at (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Additionally,; the script needs to know where to find the VMD executable, and this is defined as VMDPATH. VMDPATH must be defined as; an environment variable.; To generate images with multiple surfaces, ImageMagick must also be installed. ImageMagick is a free program which; can be installed using homebrew/pip or from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php .; With ImageMagick installed, an environment variable called MONTAGE needs to be created which points to the montage executable.; This executable can be found in the /bin/ sub-directory wherever ImageMagick was installed. VMDPATH¶; Filesystem path to the VMD executable. MONTAGE¶; Filesystem path to the Montage executable of ImageMagick. Running the Script¶. Run a PSI4 calculation, generating .cube files as detailed in the above documentation.; Add vmd_cube.py to your path. Call vmd_cube.py and pass the directory containing; the .cube files as an argument:; python vmd_cube.py /path/to/cube/files/. By default the script will search for cube files in the directory in which it is called.; In addition to individual image files for each orbital, vmd_cube will also generate an image containing all surfaces in an array; (very useful for hand-picking orbital spaces). As an example, take the cube files generated from the water calculation from the above input file.; Using vmd_cube the alpha molecular orbitals can be rendered and output in one image with:; py",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/cubeprop.html

The first number (5) is the index of the; orbital while 1-B1 indicates that this is the first orbital that belongs to the B1 irrep.; The file Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube begins with two comment lines:; Psi4 Gaussian Cube File.; Property: Psi_a_5_1-B1. Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495). The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\r",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/cubeprop.html

BASIS_FUNCTIONSThis task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\). ESPCalculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). DUAL_DESCRIPTORCalculates the dual descriptor from frontier orbitals:; \(f^2(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{\mathrm{LUMO}}(\mathbf{r})-\rho_{\mathrm{HOMO}}(\mathbf{r})\).; The dual descriptor is a good measure of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity,; containing information essentially equivalent to both Fukui functions combined.; More details on the dual descriptor itself can be found in [Morell:2005:205],; while the current implementation is described in [Martinez-Araya:2015:451].; This feature is currently only supported for closed shell systems. Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB. For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube; files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB. Keywords¶. CUBEPROP_TASKS¶. Properties to compute.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/dct.html

Sokolov; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DCT. Theory¶; Density cumulant theory (DCT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)):. \[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]; Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.; \(h_p^q\) and \(g_{pq}^{rs}\) are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and; \(\gamma_p^q\) and \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) are the elements of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\),; respectively.

However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm for the closed-shell molecules, it; is recommended to set the QC_COUPLING option to FALSE for efficiency; reasons (set by default).; For the ODC computations, the user has a choice of performing the computation of the guess orbitals and cumulants; using the corresponding DC method (set ODC_GUESS to TRUE). This can often lead to; significant computational savings, since the orbital update step in the DC methods is cheap.; Convergence of the guess orbitals and cumulants can be controlled using the; GUESS_R_CONVERGENCE option. table of contents.

In DCT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \bar{",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/dct.html

First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions. Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled; equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as; residual equations).

Note; At present dd-based solvation models; can only be used for energy calculations with SCF; wavefunctions. All ERI algorithms (PK, OUT_OF_CORE, DIRECT, DF,; CD) are supported. Warning; Currently the ddx interface cannot exploit molecular point group symmetry. Warning; Analytic gradients and Hessians are currently not available; with dd-based solvation models.

PSI4 contains code to interface to the ddx FORTRAN library developed; by A. Mikhalev et. al.. The library provides a linear-scaling implementation; of standard continuum solvation models using a domain-decomposition ansatz; [Cances:2013:054111] [Stamm:2016:054101].; Currently the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) [Klamt:1993:799] [Lipparini:2014:184108],; the polarisable continuum model (PCM) [Tomasi:2005:2999] [Nottoli:2019:6061]; and the linearized poisson-boltzmann model (LPB) [Lu:2008:973] [Jha:2023:104105] are supported.; No additional licence or configuration is required to use ddx with Psi4. Installation¶; Binary. ddx is available for Linux and macOS in form of the pyddx package; on conda-forge and on pypi.; To install from conda run conda install pyddx -c conda-forge.; To remove a conda installation, conda remove pyddx. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want ddx installed as well,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_ddx,; and let the build system fetch and install it. Using dd-based continum solvation models¶; In PSI4 two option to enable continuum solvation models; are currently implemented using either the PCMSolver or ddx package.; PCMSolver is based on a boundary-element discretisation [Cances:1998:309],; while ddx is based on a domain decomposition approach; [Cances:2013:054111] making it linear scaling.; For more details about PCMSolver see the section on PCMsolver.; For a concise introduction to the; theory behind ddx; or further literature references; see the ddx documentation.; The usage of ddx-based solvation mode",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/ddx.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/ddx.html

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/detci.html

Spin Multiplicities of Higher Roots¶; As mentioned above, DETCI works in a basis of Slater determinants, rather than; configuration state functions. The correct value of \(M_s\) is easily enforced; by fixing the number of alpha and beta electrons to be constant across all determinants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/detci.html

This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy.

However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)), the program; will typically return singlets and not triplets. However, if enough roots are sought,; higher-multiplicities may enter in. This can be avoided by ensuring that all the guess; vectors have the correct spin multiplicity, by setting CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE).; It is also possible to ask DETCI to compute roots of higher multiplicities. The desired value of spin may be; provided by setting S = \(S\). Typically, it would be a good idea in this context to also set; CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE to ensure the guess roots have the right spin. However, be advised that; seeking these higher roots may cause convergence problems, because roundoff may allow the lower-lying; roots of lower multiplicities to re-enter the computation (reducing convergence criteria may help).; For open-shell systems, the MS0 keyword is typically not relevant, and there; is no control over spin multiplicities of higher roots unless|detci__calc_s_squared| is; used.

Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\).

IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Optional arguments are minimum omega, maximum omega, molecule object; omega = ip_fitting('wb97', 0.4, 2.0, molecule=h2o). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting.

PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral. An example is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # FRAC jobs will be be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do all kinds of weird stuff; basis aug-cc-pvdz # Augmented functions are very important on the anion side; scf_type df; }. # Argument is functional.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac_traverse('wb97', molecule=h2o). The other macro is frac_nuke(), which strips several electrons out of the; system to gather information on the MSIE over a range of orbitals. The input is; identical to the above, except that the frac_traverse() call is substituted; for something like:; # Argument is the functional.; # A useful optional argument is nmax, the total number of electrons to; # strip out of the molecule, in this case, 2.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac.frac_nuke('wb97', molecule=h2o, nmax = 2).

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, STRATMANN, NAIVE,; or SBECKE.

This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{tuned-LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r} + I_{\mathrm{IP}} +; \epsilon_{\mathrm{HOMO}}\]; Note that LRC functionals with default \(\omega\) only capture the; \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r},\]; hybrid functionals only capture part of the \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Hybrid}} (r) = -; \frac{\alpha}{r},\]; and local functionals decay exponentially, resulting in completely incorrect; asymptotics,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Local}} (r) = 0\]; IP-tuned LRC functionals effectively pin the chemical potential at \(N\); electrons to the correct value determined by the ionization potential.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/dft.html

The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other.

Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBFUNCTIONAL, LIBFOCK, LIBSCF_SOLVER; Both density functional theory and Hartree–Fock theory are controlled; through the SCF module, and the SCF Introduction; section is also relevant here. Note; Starting version 1.5, the WCOMBINE option is temporarily disabled. Note; Starting version 1.4 (tag v1.4a1 in the development repository), PSI4 uses an updated and extended (to 104 elements) set; of Bragg-Slater radii. This leads to minimal deviations in absolute energies (1E-06 au) and; relative energies (below 0.002 kcal/mol for S22), depending also on the applied grid, compared; to older versions. We advise not to mix absolute energies absolute energies from before and after this change for the; calculation of relative energies. Note; After May 2017 (anytime after the v1.1 release), PSI4; switched from hand- (+Matlab) coded functionals to Libxc. Thus; many DFT results will be slightly different. Functionals more than; slightly different are B97-D, wB97X (note, not wB97X-D), SOGGA,; DFDL, and M05. Theory¶; Generalized Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) [Kohn:1965:A1133] [Parr:1989] is one of the primary; workhorses of modern computational chemistry due to its phenomenal accuracy/cost; ratio.; Pure Kohn–Sham DFT is built on the Hohenberg–Kohn theorems [Hohenberg:1964:136] which states: A) the energy is a universal; functional of the one-particle electronic density and B) there exists a set of; noninteracting quasiparticles with the same density as the true set of; electrons, with the quasiparticle states determined as eigenvectors of an; effective one-body potential encapsulating the true \(N\)-body quantum; effects.

In the; exchange hole, this manifests as the problem of Many-Electron Self-Interaction; Error (MSIE), which presents as spurious low-lying charge transfer states in; excited-state calculations, eventual metallic breakdown in extended insulators,; poor thermochemistry, and complete lack of a derivative discontinuity in the; chemical potential as integer particle numbers are crossed. On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn–Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn–Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount.

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, STRATMANN, NAIVE,; or SBECKE.

Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBFUNCTIONAL, LIBFOCK, LIBSCF_SOLVER; Both density functional theory and Hartree–Fock theory are controlled; through the SCF module, and the SCF Introduction; section is also relevant here. Note; Starting version 1.5, the WCOMBINE option is temporarily disabled. Note; Starting version 1.4 (tag v1.4a1 in the development repository), PSI4 uses an updated and extended (to 104 elements) set; of Bragg-Slater radii. This leads to minimal deviations in absolute energies (1E-06 au) and; relative energies (below 0.002 kcal/mol for S22), depending also on the applied grid, compared; to older versions. We advise not to mix absolute energies absolute energies from before and after this change for the; calculation of relative energies. Note; After May 2017 (anytime after the v1.1 release), PSI4; switched from hand- (+Matlab) coded functionals to Libxc. Thus; many DFT results will be slightly different. Functionals more than; slightly different are B97-D, wB97X (note, not wB97X-D), SOGGA,; DFDL, and M05. Theory¶; Generalized Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) [Kohn:1965:A1133] [Parr:1989] is one of the primary; workhorses of modern computational chemistry due to its phenomenal accuracy/cost; ratio.; Pure Kohn–Sham DFT is built on the Hohenberg–Kohn theorems [Hohenberg:1964:136] which states: A) the energy is a universal; functional of the one-particle electronic density and B) there exists a set of; noninteracting quasiparticles with the same density as the true set of; electrons, with the quasiparticle states determined as eigenvectors of an; effective one-body potential encapsulating the true \(N\)-body quantum; effects.

The; evaluation of these numerical integrals can be made to be linear scaling with a; reasonable amount of cleverness (mostly related to the fact that the basis; functions decay exponentially), meaning that the Coulomb and diagonalization; steps become rate limiting. This enormous potential speed gain over Hartree–Fock; with potentially exact treatment of electron correlation for “free” was one of; the primary motivations for KS-DFT’s adoption by chemists in the late 1980s and; early 1990s.; Unfortunately, local KS-DFT exhibits several spectacular failures, most of which; stem from the exponential decay of the local Kohn–Sham potential, which cannot; encapsulate long-range information in the exchange and correlation holes. In the; exchange hole, this manifests as the problem of Many-Electron Self-Interaction; Error (MSIE), which presents as spurious low-lying charge transfer states in; excited-state calculations, eventual metallic breakdown in extended insulators,; poor thermochemistry, and complete lack of a derivative discontinuity in the; chemical potential as integer particle numbers are crossed. On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn–Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn–Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount.

Don’t worry, it; will definitely NaN on you if you try to use it. Meta FunctionalsWe have recently implemented the M05 classes of meta functionals in; PSI4. Note that these functionals are not appropriate for modeling; dispersion interactions, as they lack dispersion physics. A -D functional (Such; as the much cheaper B97-D) should be used instead. Hybrid FunctionalsMany common hybrid functionals, including the ubiquitous B3LYP. PBE0 and the; B97 series are also quite good for many thermochemical problems. LRC FunctionalsLRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE. We offer a stable implementation of the Gill; association function for wS and Head-Gordon’s wB97/wB97X functionals.; Additionally, we are pleased to have recently completed a heavily conditioned; implementation of the HJS exchange-hole model, which provides an analytical form; for the short-range enhancement factor for wPBE, wPBEsol, and wB88. From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

Note that these are; only available with density-fitted, not conventional, MP2 algorithms. -D FunctionalsWe have several -D2 functionals implemented. -D3 functionls are available; with the installation of Grimme’s DFTD3 program.; For now, the pure-GGA B97-D; functional of Grimme is remarkably accurate, and the hybrid B3LYP-D; functional is also quite reliable. Note: we have made a sincere effort to rigorously test all functionals; implemented in PSI4 for correctness. If you find an error in a DFT; functional or have a request for a new functional, please let us know on our; forum or GitHub page. Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:.

This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0. Larger systems,; particularly conjugated systems, will typically have an optimized \(\omega\); between 0.1 and 0.5. Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Optional arguments are minimum omega, maximum omega, molecule object; omega = ip_fitting('wb97', 0.4, 2.0, molecule=h2o). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D. The “best-practice” input file for KS-DFT is:; memory 1 GB # As much as you've got, the DF algorithm can use. molecule {; H; H 1 0.7; }. set {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; guess sad; }. energy('b3lyp'). Advanced Functional Use and Manipulation¶; New DFT functionals can be created from scratch from within the input; file and accessed using the dft_functional keyword argument in the; energy call:; # DFT C",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.8.x/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.8.x/dft.html

Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\).

Once installed, the; dftd3/PSI4 and dftd4/PSI4 interfaces are transparent, and all corrections are; interfaced exactly alike.; The -D3 interface can use classic or simple-dftd3 programs interchangeably and will prefer the latter.; Despite different defaults in these programs when run independently,; when run through PSI4 as EmpiricalDispersion engine, each should; produce the same result. Moreover, PSI4‘s own defaults and aliases; are unchanged by the new engines, so -D continues to mean -D2,; -D3 continues to mean zero-damping without 3-body correction,; and input files should continue producing the same results. Please file; an issue if found otherwise.; Dispersion corrections are built into DFT functionals, so appending an a; posteriori correction to a computation is as simple as; energy('b2plyp-d') vs. energy('b2plyp'). For example, the; following input file computes (with much redundant work) for water a; B3LYP, a B3LYP-D2, a B3LYP-D3 (zero-damping), and a B3LYP-D4 (Becke-Johnson damping) energy.; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; energy('b3lyp'); energy('b3lyp-d'); energy('b3lyp-d3'); energy('b3lyp-d4').
