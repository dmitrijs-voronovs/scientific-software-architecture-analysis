I too suffer from lack time, so asking me to do work then walking away without even giving a single example of what is broken seems a bit rude.... Seriously, can I get one test that still fails with https://reviews.llvm.org/D33529 ?. If that cannot be done could @pcanal or @Axel-Naumann at least verify that after applying D33529 and setting `DynamicLibrary::SearchOrder = SO_LoadedFirst; // or SO_LoadedLast (don't know the problem)` 500+ tests are broken?. > I would appreciate if we can coordinate next time such breaking changes before asking for a llvm review and land patches in these particularly sensitive areas.

If so, I guess the function can indeed be simplified but the documentation needs to revise accordingly. The new code add 'GetPathInfo' and 'AccessPathName' calls to the path where DynamicPathName returned a positive answer. Can you verify that those check are not already done in DynamicPathName?
