Many MMseqs2 modules use less memory and run faster. ## Known Issues; * High sensitivity searches (higher than -s 6) with precomputed indices should fail. Pass `--db-load-mode 3` as a workaround to the MMseqs2 call. ## Breaking Changes; * Default taxonomy mode is assigning the same taxonomic label as the top hit. The previous ""approximate 2bLCA"" mode can be used with `--lca-mode 3` or the non-approximated 2bLCA with `--lca-mode 2`; * MMseqs2 will refuse to compile on compilers without OpenMP support (Use `-DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0` to force a single-threaded no OpenMP build); * The confusingly named (and probably non-functional) `--global-alignment` parameter is gone; * File names of the **latest** precompiled binaries changed.

Precomputed databases also require less overhead RAM, since only the required parts are loaded; * `easy-search`, `easy-taxonomy`, `easy-linclust` and `easy-cluster` workflows can take an",MatchSource.RELEASES,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/releases/tag/10-6d92c

It will exit with an error message on wrong input, where it would previously crash; * `kmermatcher` reports the diagonal with the most k-mer matches; * `kmermatcher` scales the number of k-mers with sequence length (`--kmer-per-seq-scale`); * `rescorediagonal` got two new rescore modes, one for global alignment scoring and one for scoring a quasi global alignment fullfilling a local window criterion ; * Peak memory usage for reading in very large databases is greatly reduced. 128GB nodes should comfortably be able to deal with up to the maximum of 4.2 billion entries ; * Parameters taking byte values support syntax with a SI suffix (e.g., `--split-memory-limit 64G`); * Nucleotide substitution matrices should be user definable ; * Taxonomy report is compatible with [Pavian](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/pavian).

More search modes like tblastx, reciprocal best hit and linsearch. New output format SAM. Support for compressed databases to reduce hard disk and memory requirements. . ## Known Issues; * Iterative search only works up to 2 iterations. ## Breaking Changes; * MMseqs2 now saves a lot on IO by not merging result datafiles; There is still a single `.index` file, but the corresponding data files are split into multiple parts (as many as threads were used previously); * MMseqs2 now uses the VTML80 [1,2] substitution matrix to speed up the prefiltering (changeable by `--seed-sub-mat`), the final alignment is still computed with the Blosum62 (still changeable by `--sub-mat`); * All databases have now a `.dbtype` file; * MMseqs2 Docker image is now based on Debian instead of Alpine; * Changed Orf header format to be more space efficent. The new format is now `orignIdentifer startPos(-/+)len flag`; * `prefilter` returns ungapped-alignment scores instead of e-values ; * `createindex` the file extention is now `.idx` instead of the previous `.[s]k[6,7]` format. ## Features; * Support for tblastx-style nucl-nucl translated searches; `mmseqs search nuclDB1 nuclDb2 aln tmp --search-mode 2`; * Support for nucleotide searches; `mmseqs search nuclDB1 nuclDb2 aln tmp --search-mode 3`; * `convertalis` has learned to return SAM formatted output (preview); * Database can be compressed by applying [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) on each entry (`--compressed 1`); * Also added `compress` and `decompress` modules; * `rbh` workflow for reciprocal best hit searches added ; * `linclust` can now cluster nucleotide sequences on both forward and reverse strand; * Added `linsearch`, a lightning fast search for proteins and nucleotide sequences (preview; easy workflow variant `easy-linsearch` also added); * `createlinindex` computes an index for `linsearch`; * `taxonomy` uses `--orf-start-mode 1` to annotate",MatchSource.RELEASES,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/releases/tag/8-fac81
