For the detailed information on the computed; transforms please refer to the FFTW manual, chapter ""What FFTW really computes"". How to use it:; 1) Create an instance of TFFTComplex - this will allocate input and output; arrays (unless an in-place transform is specified); 2) Run the Init() function with the desired flags and settings; 3) Set the data (via SetPoints(), SetPoint() or SetPointComplex() functions); 4) Run the Transform() function; 5) Get the output (via GetPoints(), GetPoint() or GetPointComplex() functions); 6) Repeat steps 3)-5) as needed. For a transform of the same size, but with different flags or sign, rerun the Init(); function and continue with steps 3)-5); NOTE: 1) running Init() function will overwrite the input array!

Note that the compression settings may be changed at any time.; The new compression settings will only apply to branches created; or attached after the setting is changed and other objects written; after the setting is changed. In case the file does not exist or is not a valid ROOT file,; it is made a Zombie. One can detect this situation with a code like:; TFile f(""file.root"");; if (f.IsZombie()) {; cout << ""Error opening file"" << endl;; exit(-1);; }. When opening the file, the system checks the validity of this directory.; If something wrong is detected, an automatic Recovery is performed. In; this case, the file is scanned sequentially reading all logical blocks; and attempting to rebuild a correct directory (see TFile::Recover).; One can disable the automatic recovery procedure when reading one; or more files by setting the environment variable ""TFile::Recover 0""; in the system.rootrc file.

The enumeration ROOT::ECompressionAlgorithm associates each; algorithm with a number. There is a utility function to help; to set the value of compress. For example,; ROOT::CompressionSettings(ROOT::kLZMA, 1); will build an integer which will set the compression to use; the LZMA algorithm and compression level 1. These are defined; in the header file Compression.h. Note that the compression settings may be changed at any time.; The new compression settings will only apply to branches created; or attached after the setting is changed and other objects written; after the setting is changed. In case the file does not exist or is not a valid ROOT file,; it is made a Zombie. One can detect this situation with a code like:; TFile f(""file.root"");; if (f.IsZombie()) {; cout << ""Error opening file"" << endl;; exit(-1);; }. When opening the file, the system checks the validity of this directory.; If something wrong is detected, an automatic Recovery is performed. In; this case, the file is scanned sequentially reading all logical blocks; and attempting to rebuild a correct directory (see TFile::Recover).; One can disable the automatic recovery procedure when reading one; or more files by setting the environment variable ""TFile::Recover 0""; in the system.rootrc file.

A caching system to speed up network I/O, i.e. when there is; no operating system caching support (like the buffer cache for; local disk I/O).

ROOT; » IO; » IO; » TFileCacheWrite. class TFileCacheWrite: public TObject. TFileCacheWrite : a cache when writing files over the network. A caching system to speed up network I/O, i.e. when there is; no operating system caching support (like the buffer cache for; local disk I/O). The cache makes sure that every I/O is done with; a (large) fixed length buffer thereby avoiding many small I/O's.; Currently the write cache system is used by the classes TNetFile,; TXNetFile and TWebFile (via TFile::WriteBuffers()). The write cache is automatically created when writing a remote file; (created in TFile::Open()). Function Members (Methods); public:.

This method invokes several other methods:. InitCells initializes memory storage for cells and begins exploration process; from the root cell. The empty cells are allocated/filled using CellFill.; The procedure Grow which loops over cells, picks up the cell with the biggest; ``driver integral'', see Comp. Phys.

Some; special care needs to be taken in the case of bins with zero content. For more; details please see the original publication cited above. An example application of this fit is given below. For a TH1* histogram; (""data"") fitted as the sum of three Monte Carlo sources (""mc""):. {; TH1F *data; //data histogram; TH1F *mc0; // first MC histogram; TH1F *mc1; // second MC histogram; TH1F *mc2; // third MC histogram; .... // retrieve histograms; TObjArray *mc = new TObjArray(3); // MC histograms are put in this array; mc->Add(mc0);; mc->Add(mc1);; mc->Add(mc2);; TFractionFitter* fit = new TFractionFitter(data, mc); // initialise; fit->Constrain(1,0.0,1.0); // constrain fraction 1 to be between 0 and 1; fit->SetRangeX(1,15); // use only the first 15 bins in the fit; Int_t status = fit->Fit(); // perform the fit; cout << ""fit status: "" << status << endl;; if (status == 0) { // check on fit status; TH1F* result = (TH1F*) fit->GetPlot();; data->Draw(""Ep"");; result->Draw(""same"");; }; }. Assumptions. A few assumptions need to be made for the fit procedure to be carried out:. (1) The total number of events in each template is not too small; (so that its Poisson uncertainty can be neglected).; (2) The number of events in each bin is much smaller than the total; number of events in each template (so that multinomial; uncertainties can be replaced with Poisson uncertainties). Biased fit uncertainties may result if these conditions are not fulfilled; (see e.g. arXiv:0803.2711). Instantiation. A fit object is instantiated through; TFractionFitter* fit = new TFractionFitter(data, mc);; A number of basic checks (intended to ensure that the template histograms; represent the same ""kind"" of distribution as the data one) are carried out.; The TVirtualFitter object is then addressed and all fit parameters (the; temp",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TFractionFitter.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TFractionFitter.html

Comm. 77 (1993) 219-228, and http://www.hep.man.ac.uk/~roger/hfrac.f). The virtue of this fit is that it takes into account both data and Monte Carlo; statistical uncertainties. The way in which this is done is through a standard; likelihood fit using Poisson statistics; however, the template (MC) predictions; are also varied within statistics, leading to additional contributions to the; overall likelihood. This leads to many more fit parameters (one per bin per; template), but the minimisation with respect to these additional parameters is; done analytically rather than introducing them as formal fit parameters. Some; special care needs to be taken in the case of bins with zero content. For more; details please see the original publication cited above. An example application of this fit is given below. For a TH1* histogram; (""data"") fitted as the sum of three Monte Carlo sources (""mc""):. {; TH1F *data; //data histogram; TH1F *mc0; // first MC histogram; TH1F *mc1; // second MC histogram; TH1F *mc2; // third MC histogram; .... // retrieve histograms; TObjArray *mc = new TObjArray(3); // MC histograms are put in this array; mc->Add(mc0);; mc->Add(mc1);; mc->Add(mc2);; TFractionFitter* fit = new TFractionFitter(data, mc); // initialise; fit->Constrain(1,0.0,1.0); // constrain fraction 1 to be between 0 and 1; fit->SetRangeX(1,15); // use only the first 15 bins in the fit; Int_t status = fit->Fit(); // perform the fit; cout << ""fit status: "" << status << endl;; if (status == 0) { // check on fit status; TH1F* result = (TH1F*) fit->GetPlot();; data->Draw(""Ep"");; result->Draw(""sam",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TFractionFitter.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TFractionFitter.html

Weights histograms. Weights histograms (for a motivation see the above publication) can be specified; for the individual MC sources through; fit->SetWeight(parameter #, pointer to weights histogram);; and unset by specifying a null pointer. Obtaining fit results. The fit is carried out through; Int_t status = fit->Fit();; where status is the code returned from the ""MINIMIZE"" command. For fits; that converged, parameter values and errors can be obtained through; fit->GetResult(parameter #, value, error);; and the histogram corresponding to the total Monte Carlo prediction (which; is not the same as a simple weighted sum of the input Monte Carlo distributions); can be obtained by; TH1* result = fit->GetPlot();. Using different histograms. It is possible to change the histogram being fitted through; fit->SetData(TH1* data);; and to change the template histogram for a given parameter number through; fit->SetMC(parameter #, TH1* MC);; This can speed up code in case of multiple data or template histograms;; however, it should be done with care as any settings are taken over from; the previous fit. In addition, neither the dimensionality nor the numbers of; bins of the histograms should change (in that case it is better to instantiate; a new TFractionFitter object). Errors. Any serious inconsistency results in an error. Function Members (Methods); public:.

(1) The total number of events in each template is not too small; (so that its Poisson uncertainty can be neglected).; (2) The number of events in each bin is much smaller than the total; number of events in each template (so that multinomial; uncertainties can be replaced with Poisson uncertainties). Biased fit uncertainties may result if these conditions are not fulfilled; (see e.g. arXiv:0803.2711). Instantiation. A fit object is instantiated through; TFractionFitter* fit = new TFractionFitter(data, mc);; A number of basic checks (intended to ensure that the template histograms; represent the same ""kind"" of distribution as the data one) are carried out.; The TVirtualFitter object is then addressed and all fit parameters (the; template fractions) declared (initially unbounded). Applying constraints. Fit parameters can be constrained through; fit->Constrain(parameter #, lower bound, upper bound);; Setting lower bound = upper bound = 0 removes the constraint (a la Minuit);; however, a function; fit->Unconstrain(parameter #); is also provided to simplify this. Setting parameter values. The function; TVirtualFitter* vFit = fit->GetFitter();; is provided for direct access to the TVirtualFitter object. This allows to; set and fix parameter values, and set step sizes directly. Restricting the fit range. The fit range can be restricted through; fit->SetRangeX(first bin #, last bin #);; and freed using; fit->ReleaseRangeX();; For 2D histograms the Y range can be similarly restricted using; fit->SetRangeY(first bin #, last bin #);; fit->ReleaseRangeY();; and for 3D histograms also; fit->SetRangeZ(first bin #, last bin #);; fit->ReleaseRangeZ();; It is also possible to exclude individual bins from the fit through; fit->ExcludeBin(bin #);; where the given bin number is assumed to follow the TH1::GetBin() numbering.; Any bins excluded in this way can be included again using the corresponding; fit->IncludeBin(bin #);.

Weights histograms. Weights histograms (for a motivation see the above publication) can be specified; for the individual MC sources through; fit->SetWeight(parameter #, pointer to weights histogram);; and unset by specifying a null pointer. Obtaining fit results. The fit is carried out through; Int_t status = fit->Fit();; where status is the code returned from the ""MINIMIZE"" command. For fits; that converged, parameter values and errors can be obtained through; fit->GetResult(parameter #, value, error);; and the histogram corresponding to the total Monte Carlo prediction (which; is not the same as a simple weighted sum of the input Monte Carlo distributions); can be obtained by; TH1* result = fit->GetPlot();. Using different histograms. It is possible to change the histogram being fitted through; fit->SetData(TH1* data);; and to change the template histogram for a given parameter number through; fit->SetMC(parameter #, TH1* MC);; This can speed up code in case of multiple data or template histograms;; however, it should be done with care as any settings are taken over from; the previous fit. In addition, neither the dimensionality nor the numbers of; bins of the histograms should change (in that case it is better to instantiate; a new TFractionFitter object). Errors.
