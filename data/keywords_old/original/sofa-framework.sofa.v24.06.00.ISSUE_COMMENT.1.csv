https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/436#issuecomment-333965790:329,Integrability,depend,dependency,329,"Great :-). Well, PIMPLs and forward declarations solve two orthogonal issues:. - forward declarations are (mostly) for types in the API defined by the class i.e. public methods; - PIMPLs are for when the implementation pulls off too many includes that are only needed by the implementation, or when you want/need to break source dependency. Typically forward declarations are best packed in a header for each plugin/module e.g. ; ```c++; #include <sofa/core/types.h>; #include <Compliant/types.h>; ```. which itself may pull forward decls from subfolders, like `#include <Compliant/mapping/types.h>`. . Of course we don't want to end up with yet another gigantic include graph, but forward includes are typically much smaller than actual includes so we should be fine io-wise. . Concerning PIMPLs, you'll need to put it behind a `std::unique_ptr` like so:. ```c++; class foo {; struct pimpl_type;; std::unique_ptr<pimpl_type> pimpl;. public:; foo();; ~foo();; };; ```; otherwise your class will have undefined `sizeof`, and you won't be able to instantiate it unless you include the PIMPL definition (which you don't want by construction). My feeling is that the general guideline should be about forward declarations: PIMPLs are seldom needed, and really put some burden on the programmer as you need to write the glue code between the pimpl and the actual class. On the contrary, forward decls are easy to setup and to implement, and *should* definitely improve build times.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/436#issuecomment-333965790

Of course we don't want to end up with yet another gigantic include graph, but forward includes are typically much smaller than actual includes so we should be fine io-wise. . Concerning PIMPLs, you'll need to put it behind a `std::unique_ptr` like so:. ```c++; class foo {; struct pimpl_type;; std::unique_ptr<pimpl_type> pimpl;. public:; foo();; ~foo();; };; ```; otherwise your class will have undefined `sizeof`, and you won't be able to instantiate it unless you include the PIMPL definition (which you don't want by construction). My feeling is that the general guideline should be about forward declarations: PIMPLs are seldom needed, and really put some burden on the programmer as you need to write the glue code between the pimpl and the actual class. On the contrary, forward decls are easy to setup and to implement, and *should* definitely improve build times.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/436#issuecomment-333965790

I just saw that the tutorials are out of the releases so I understand that the coming soon 17.12 is more important now. However, these tutorials are the direction new interns (or other new people) are given to discover Sofa.

This point reaches consensus I think. I don't see anything that can go against the merge of this PR in this topic. 2. split unit tests and functionnal tests; This is a different topic and should be discussed in a separate issue. Anyway my 2 cents about this:; - obviously this is a good idea. I cannot push forward enough this idea.; - just keep in mind that these unit-tests should remain FAST to run, since they will be run at each build. (ie. the filemonitor tests, for example, should be refactored to spend less than 10 seconds to run otherwise they will soon become a pain).

Here is what I observed during my tests (I'm working part time on this, it is entirely possible that I come back later to correct those statements of mine :) ). > you need to properly initialize/finalize sofa and core modules (see Main.cpp in the runSofa application). Yes. I'm usually leaning towards making most of the functions available and let the script use what it need. So if I'm writing a _runSofa_ like application in python, I should be able to init the components there, create/set the simulation, add the needed message handlers to the MessageDispatcher, and set the paths (plugin, config, sofa prefix) there. If this complicate too much the python script, than making optional python util scripts that set all of this for the user could be a clean option.

Having the featured re-discussed again is probably an indication that something is somehow problematic :) . As I said before there is fact two different issues...one is about mixing in the same scene object/solver with different floating point representation while the other is about having SReal mapped to float or double by default. . The current approach, despite it does not match individual preferences, makes a relative consensus: ; SReal to be switched via a define; Vec3 that is using SReal; Vec3d that is using double; Vec3f that is using float; We use vec3d or vec3f when we want to be explicit on the type or we use Vec3 if we don't. And of course life would be easier if everyone agreed to use double only code (or according to Matthieu's opinion float only) but I don't think this will happen soon ;) . To me the real problem is not there, it is in how we have implemented the mixing in the same scene object/solver with different floating point representation. Our current implement is based on instantiating templates in the factory for each types so that when the types matches the objects can work together without conversion cost. ; This design is implemented with the conditional #ifdef SOFA_FLOAT/SOFA_DOUBLE and is very intrusive (our code is harder to write/read/understand, easy to forget things and/or have 'hidden' or subtle bugs (confirmed by the quick test made by @vmagno)) while there is only very specific gain in certain limited use case. . So we are trading run-time speed for a development cost.

Taking ""16 days to merge 20 lines of code is a waste of time"" is true...and this is the consequence that no-one ever took time to handle that properly. As usual no one's concerns tend to become everyone's waste of time. . My suggestion to fix that is:; - 0) make a style sheet that matches the Sofa guideline (or change the guideline to match an automated formatter style sheet which is much easier :)); - 1) apply an automated style sheet to format the whole code base. ; - 2) when making PR, everyone should apply the provided style sheet.; - 3) when merging a PR, the automated stylesheet should be applied again. . But ho wait ! ; Some told me here is already a stylesheet for astyle (to use in qtcreator) since years in the tools/astyle ; directory. ; This may be a good starting point for (0) and (1). .

This work made me realize that it will be very hard, if not impossible, to anticipate every subtle change needed by the refactoring.; - Do we want SPM to be an all inclusive script to refactor completely SOFA? ; every refactoring is unique and needs to change SPM ; -> namespace handling ; -> includes refactoring; - Or should we prefer it to be an easy-to-use script to **bootstrap** any refactoring? ; -> very specific changes will have to be done by hand. I propose to go for solution 2 and to provide a git patch covering the work done after SPM job (fixing includes, fixing namespaces, ...). The progress of this task is **85%** since I now have to create the patch and to provide everything in the PR. ## Moving on with Sofa.Helper.Bvh; Following [the latest iteration on NG architecture](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/sofang-v3) and Damien's first draft in his [cleanTheMessStep1](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/cleanTheMessStep1/ng) branch, I started refactoring SofaFramework with Sofa.Helper.Bvh. This task needed me to heavily change/adapt SPM. It contributed to make me prefer solution 2 above. The progress of this task is **60%**. TODO:; - update the recipe with latest SPM changes (namespace handling); - adapt SPM output for smooth transition from SOFA; - create the patch; - open a PR. ## Next steps; - Finalize and merge Sofa.Component.Utils PR; - Open a new PR: Sofa.Helper.Bvh; - Continue with SofaHelper refactoring. ----------.

If yes, the headlessRecorder might be a good solution. > I know the old GUI is destined to dissapear slowly, but the issue will be the same in sofaqtquick. It would be really interesting to be able to grab a specific opengl context from a widget for instance, or directly from the sofa scene. I don´t know how the current gui works so I can´t help :/; In my opinion. it depends of QT. QGLWidget + QGLFrameBuffer might be the trick. . From your idea, I like the ""component"" design. Be able to grab opengl context from any QWidget doesn´t make sense to me.

I also think that explicit data typing is a necessary feature to override an implicit type introspection. In my plugin for instance I have some ""relatively complex"" data structures that are reduced to basic numpy arrays when passed to python, and for which type introspection from python back to cpp wouldn't give the correct type. Also, wouldn't it make sense to completely override the datatype::name() string for the python style typename, already in the sofa DataTypeInfo, not just in the python factory?; It would break scenes that explicits template types, but it would be more consistent.

If you want to provide new examples, that’s also ok! In the case of PSDEExamples/01-basic/ changing the type string in DataEngine.py from 'd' to 'int' already fixes the problem. For PSDEExamples/02-advanced/ I couldn’t find the error immediately. . - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Inputs my opinion is similar to Damien’s:. > Sure...what we want to do is to create a new data with the exact same type of the data pointed by a link. So making a clone of an existing data (to get its type) and then initialize its parent would do the trick without needed all the factory and datatypename things. . I also do think that the existing linking mechanism could be complemented by a cloning feature that creates a copy of a BaseData object. Probably just a clone()-function in BaseData. This would avoid the implementation of a “heavy-weight” factory, like Damien said. To add this data to the correct object (the PSDE) it is only necessary to set the owner, I think. Finally, linking is done by using setParent(). In this way the user can program freely in C++ without worrying about whether his newly defined compound type needs to be made available in the factory. - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Outputs my ideas are not as concrete, but maybe helpful. For me there exist two cases:. 1) The Output of the PSDE is connected to an Input of a sofa-object that has static datas, e.g., sofa-objects whose code is written in C++. An example for such an object would be MechanicalObject (MO) that always has the same data (position, velocity, force, …). 2) The Output of the PSDE is connected to a scripted sofa-object, like another PSDE or similar.

If you want to provide new examples, that’s also ok! In the case of PSDEExamples/01-basic/ changing the type string in DataEngine.py from 'd' to 'int' already fixes the problem. For PSDEExamples/02-advanced/ I couldn’t find the error immediately. . - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Inputs my opinion is similar to Damien’s:. > Sure...what we want to do is to create a new data with the exact same type of the data pointed by a link. So making a clone of an existing data (to get its type) and then initialize its parent would do the trick without needed all the factory and datatypename things. . I also do think that the existing linking mechanism could be complemented by a cloning feature that creates a copy of a BaseData object. Probably just a clone()-function in BaseData. This would avoid the implementation of a “heavy-weight” factory, like Damien said. To add this data to the correct object (the PSDE) it is only necessary to set the owner, I think. Finally, linking is done by using setParent(). In this way the user can program freely in C++ without worrying about whether his newly defined compound type needs to be made available in the factory. - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Outputs my ideas are not as concrete, but maybe helpful. For me there exist two cases:. 1) The Output of the PSDE is connected to an Input of a sofa-object that has static datas, e.g., sofa-objects whose code is written in C++. An example for such an object would be MechanicalObject (MO) that always has the same data (position, velocity, force, …). 2) The Output of the PSDE is connected to a scripted sofa-object, like another PSDE or similar.

So basically, while some people call update() in their handleEvent method, this should never be done, except in some (quite) twisted cases.; Btw, it took me quite some time to understand that.. few months ago, all my engines were calling update() in handleEvent, and I had a lot of problems because of that.. ^^. Technically, in the case of the scriptDataEngine, if you remove entirely the call to the update function in handleEvent, and if your dependency graph is well built, you should get the behavior you want",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-407008370

Do you think we should strive to preserve that behavior and unlink the triggering by an event? From my part it needs more testing to see the behavior. . Returning to the issues part of this PR:; - I've checked the examples and everything seems to work nicely. I modified one example by adding a chained PSDE, which also works (by explicitly declaring the type of the output); - I find the following syntax for declaring a vacant output a little bit confusing: ; `self.addNewOutput('average', value='0')`; I would probably leave out the 'value' altogether, because this syntax suggests that it has some integer or even string type. But this is not the main issue now.; - I think the main issue now is to get a review from the guys to see the feasibility of the concept in general and of the modifications at the level of Base.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-407380411

I made it possible to pass inputs to PythonScriptDataEngines directly through the call to createObject(), which makes it more similar to how components are created in the SceneGraph normally. the example in PSDEAverageEngine.pyscn show the behavior. There are a few downsides in the current implementation though:; - I didn't investigate the effects on error handling (creating input data fields while the field should actually be considered as an ""unused data field name"" for instance..; - I had to hack my way around, probably because I got a bit lost in the SofaPython codebase, trying to figure out how the bindings worked... so the implementation is probably not the cleanest possible.. :/; - The current implementation of the parse() function binding does not pass the BaseObjectDescription object to python, which makes it impossible to retrieve the ""unused datafields"" that we need for the automatic input bindings. Thus I added a ""datalinks"" function, called after the parse() function in python, that takes the key/values pairs of unused attributes passed to createObject, and creates new inputs from them. I chose to create a separate function for that because I didn't dare modifying the behavior of the parse function itself, but it might be worth passing the attributes directly to the python parse method instead, since it is how it's done on the C++ side of things...?.

So I understand everything is on tracks on this bug then. I guess you have a lot of job to do guys with all the issues that you have to treat, and you are doing such a great job with SOFA framework!; I am discovering it since a few days now, and I really enjoy the journey :). Is there any chance that this issue will be treated in the near future?. Anyway, I found a work around:; - I read the `.vtk` file with the `meshio` python library.; - Then I export the mesh in `.mesh` format.; - I finally import the `.mesh` file into the gmsh python API, and export it in `.msh` format, which is readable by the `MeshGmshLoader`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/652#issuecomment-2155660392

We have to wait for the creation of the component that will take the PSDE's output as a link to derive it. This means that the steps to derive an output's datatype are the following:. - in Python, in the `parse()` method, call addNewOuput, and give it a datafield name, but no type and an input value field `addNewInput(""MyName"", value="""")`; - in C++, a new datafield is created, but its datatype is void*. To know that this field has been created from a PSDE output, and is not yet properly connected, an alias is added on the data `addAlias(""psde_output"");`; - The next component is created in the scene, a c++ component this time, that knows the type of its inputs. ; - In its parse method, the link is found to the PSDE's output, but its type is incompatible (void* vs vector<Vec3d> for instance). ; - We check if the linked datafield has an alias ""psde_output"" and if so, remove that datafield and recreate it with the same field name, but this time the good datatype; - We set the newly created field as the parent of the parsed datafield in the component. Done. . To do so it was necessary to:; - Make creation of Data possible through a `getNewInstance()` method in Base; - Make BaseData removable from Sofa components in Base `removeData(BaseData*)`; - add in Binding_Base a method called from `addNewIO()` to find a data's type from its value when a link is provided (`deriveTypeFromParentValue()`) ; - Modify Base::parseField() to handle connecting to a parent value that has incompatible type when necessary; - Modify quite a bit the error handling process in addNewData() and parse() (which I hope to have done properly).

Actually, I didn't think of it immediately when you said it, but this is already what the current implementation does (kind of, the implementation is different but the concept is the same):. if the decorator `@sp.ParseInputs` is not set on the parse method, the passing of arguments through the createObject() is disabled, and the input argument will be ignored.; setting @sp.ParseInputs is kind of the equivalent to a boolean flag in the class allowing ""inline"" definitions.

I disagree about your suggestion as this PR is not about binding GeometryAlgorithm's like object. . GeometryAlgorithm is inheriting from BaseObject. To use it you need the full Scene Graph and plenty of dependency to Base/BaseObject/Data/Link/SceneGraph/..... The underlying idea is to use them in ""your scene"" as part of your scene/simulation. But if you 'just' want to test intersection between ray/plane using GeometryAlgorithmes imply a lot of boilerplate code to manage the ""scene graph"" and baseobject management. . In this PR the target is not to expose GeometryAlgorithm in python, it is more to have a low-level API that propose geometrical object (c++ object, not BaseObject) and their associated operations as well as the corresponding binding to python. The key target of that this API is to be usable with as few as possible boilerplate code and without any scene graph/base/baseobject's folks. . So the SofaGeometry module proposed in this PR can be seen as 'one' level lower in the software stack that GeometryAlgorithm. The interest of this module is that it can be used as-is (API style), in C++ or in python. Of course it is possible to go one step further (in that case I suggest to do that in a different module and in a different PR) where the c++ object implemented in SofaGeometry are exposed in the SceneGraph by inhering from BaseObject. .

Indeed, as @damienmarchal said, I wanted in this PR to remove the need to call parent init() in all BaseObject derived classes. This is more a proposal than a confident solution. . > data fields are conditionally needed when a third one is set to true/false (@damienmarchal). I think this ""true/false implying other data fields"" mechanism is a bad design and for this case no checking solution will be clean. The other data fields should be part of another Component linked to the first one or in an inherited Component. Unfortunately I guess this mechanism is already in a lot of Components... @epernod I understand and agree with your concern that each object should check it's own Datas but I'm not sure it's compatible with the idea of removing the need to call parent init(). I think we have to choose:; 1. removing the need to call parent init() but doing the check outside of the object with a Visitor; 2. doing the check inside the object but keeping the need to call parent init(). I'm open to any proposal combining the pros of 1 and 2.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/754#issuecomment-416561180

Damien,; Nota bene:; I disagree about your saying ""I think this ""true/false implying other data fields"" mechanism is a bad design and for this case no checking solution will be clean. "" .

For the syntax about Data...everything is implemented in 'Binding_Data.cpp'. ; The function SofaData_asMapping_ass_subscript is the one called when using the [aaa] = operation. ; ```cpp; static int SofaData_asMapping_ass_subscript(PyObject *o, PyObject *key, PyObject *value); {; ....; /// This line is actually calling the ""python"" part implementation because I was too lazy; /// to implement it using C-Python API. So the function is really implemented partially with python ; /// and partially with c++ :) ; if( Data_ass_subscript(o,key,value) ); return 0;; ; /// after that it is a lot of ugly c-python api code. ; ....; ```. And the corresponding cython code (in Binding_DataArray.pyx); ```python; def sliceToRange(c, end):; start = 0; stop = end; if c.start != None:; start = c.start; if c.stop != None:; stop = c.stop; return xrange(start, stop) . cdef public bool Data_ass_subscript(o,key,value):; if isinstance(key, slice):; start, stop, step = key.start, key.stop, key.step; for i in xrange(start,stop):; Data_helper(o, i, value); return True; elif callable(key):; g = key(o) ; for i in g:; Data_helper(o, i, value); return True; elif isinstance(key, tuple):; if isinstance(key[0], slice) and isinstance(key[1], slice):; igen = sliceToRange(key[0], o.shape[0]); jgen = sliceToRange(key[1], o.shape[1]); for i in igen:; for j in jgen:; Data_helper(o,(i,j),value) ; return True ; return False; ```. Mixing code to implement a single function is clearly not the way to go. But i found that implementing complete complex function using the C-python api in cython is way more easier than writing them in C.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/767#issuecomment-419024819

I'm hesitating between the following two design:. ```__getattr__``` returns a DataContainer object implementing lot of operations allowing:; ```python; root = Sofa.Node(""root""); obj = root.createObject(""MechanicalObject"", name=""test"", position=aList). np = numpy.zeros((100,3)). p.position = [[1.0,2.0,3.0]]; p.position = np; p.position += [1.0,2.0,3.0]; p.position += np; p.position += Vec3d((0.,0.0,0.0)). ## To get a numpy array view out the DataContainer it is needed to request it like that:; with p.position.array() as wa: ; wa += np ; wa *= np; # Other numpy.array operation; ```; This syntax guarantee that the beginEditPtr/endEditPtr is correctly called when the data are written. The drawback is that I have to re+implement a lot of operation on the DataContainer object (add,mul, iadd, imul, etc..etc...)which is annoying. The other approach is much lighter in term of code as it is directly a numpy.array out of the ```__getattr__``` function. This allows to do; ```python; np = numpy.zeros((100,3)). p.position = [[1.0,2.0,3.0]]; p.position = np; p.position += [1.0,2.0,3.0]; p.position += np; p.position += Vec3d((0.,0.0,0.0)). ## To get have correct management of begin/end... you should do like that:; with p.WriteAccessor(""position"") as wa:; wa += np ; # Other numpy.array operation; ```; The problem with this version is that doing:; ```; d = p.position; d += np; ```; Will change the data through numpy code without incrementing the data counter which violates the expected semantic of the DataEngine mechanismes.

Here is my understanding (don't trust my word, check what I'm saying). . During simulation the animation loop triggers visitors to traverse the scene graph and perform specific action on the nodes. ; The important thing in a visitor is to override the following function:; - processNodeTopDown(simulation::Node*) to implement a specific behavior when entering in a new node while traversing the scene graph (fwd). ; - processNodeBottomUp(Node*) to implement a specific behavior when entering in a node while traversing the graph from the leaves to the root (bwd). Let's now focus on mechanical aspects. ; In Sofa, a lot of the sofa visitors are in-heriting from BaseMechanicalVisitor. This visitor is implementing a very specific behavior in processNodeTopDown & processNodeBottomUp. ; This behavior is more or less (see in MechanicalVisitor.cpp):; ```cpp; for(s : node.solvers); fwdSolver(s); if(node.mstate !=null); if(node.mapping!=null); /// We are in a node with amechanical state and a mapping ; if(stopAtMechanicalmapping(node.mapping)); return; fwdMechanicalMapping(node.mapping,);; fwdMappedMechanicalState(node.mstate); ; else; /// We are in a node with amechanical state but without a mapping ; fwdMechanicalState(node.mstate); ...; /// plenty of other scenarios..; ...; for(constraint : node.constraints); fwdConstraintSet(constriant); for(forcefield : node.forcefield); fwdForceField(forcefield); ....; ```; The general idea in this BaseMechanicalVisitor is to implement custom behavior that are triggered wen specific scene ""patterns"" are recognized.

Since this situation was in place already in 2010, I implemented at that time (with help of @ChristianDuriez <https://github.com/ChristianDuriez>) a ""temporary"" workaround: a special forcefield, which maps the stiffness matrix from the slave node to the master node. This allowed us to use LDL solvers with mechanical mapping.

In fact the mapping was inverting the triangles because their orientation in the tetra-container was not logical to have a well oriented surface. . Let see if it breaks something.

This required some changes int the GUI and I never worked on the GUI,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/883#issuecomment-454340240

Concerning the DataCallback, it seems to me that it is a very similar to the DataTrackerFunctor class in SOFA.; Functors would allow you to trigger a call to your component's method, or any other object that you pass to your functor's ctor. You could also assign multiple functors to a single input data, just like you do with the DataCallback::addCallback() method, or assign only one functor, that then uses a vector of std::functions internally, called successively in its operator().; Sure it requires to wrap your callback method in a struct or class, but the cost is not very high IMHO, compared to adding a new Data tracking class in SOFA, where multiple tracking methods already exist, and aren't well known, nor very used by most users, as this PR, or a quick search in SOFA's codebase proves (DataTrackerCallback, DataTracker, DataTrackerDDGNode, DataTrackerEngine, DataTrackerFunctor, DataEngine.......). Maybe a better alternative would be to provide in SOFA a default functor for the DataTrackerFunctor, taking advantage of C++11's `std::function` function (as @damienmarchal mentioned) to store methods & call them in its operator()?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/911#issuecomment-460209030

I was just passing by and notice the work done by fred so thanks for the work done. .

But now this is done I wonder what are the difference with the DataCallback and the existing DataTrackerFunctor implemented in DataTracker.h ? Can you explain a bit ? . To me the differences are:; - the DataTrackerFunctor is allowing one callback and not multiple (but should be easy to change); - the DataTrackerFunctor is templated by the callback (which look not needed to me) ; - the DataTrackerFunctor is not using lambda/functional (but should be easy to change); - the DataTrackerFunctor is passing itself to the functor (which I think is a good idea to access the list of data that have changed, but...lambda are much more easy to work with.); - the DataCallback is storing the tracked data in m_data but this is also done in its parent ""inputs"" is this data duplication useful ? ; - the DataTrackerFunctor is ""hacking"" the setDirtyValue() to trigger the callback while the DataCallback is using notifyEndEdit().

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/936#issuecomment-466958911:856,Usability,simpl,simplify,856,"> Could you give us more precisions regarding the need to change from enums to strings for the integration methods?. Two reasons motivated the use of strings : ; 1) Right now when specifying the type of numerical integration method in python or xml scripts the user had to use for instance numericalIntegrationMethod=""3"" which is not descriptive at all. It is preferable to use numericalIntegrationMethod=""Tetrahedron Gauss"" for the maintenance of the code. Using OptionsGroup could solve this issue I believe. 2) Inheritance. In the plugin ""SofaHighOrder"" I specify new types of numerical integration methods on triangles. While the APi allows to add a new method, the enum class cannot be extended ( I can use a number like 4 but this creates warnings and is not satisfactory). Therefore using a string class is more versatile. . > **If** the goal is to simplify the conversion from the string (passed in XML / Python scenes) to the C++ enums, wouldn't it be best to take advangate of the OptionsGroup datatype already present in SOFA?.
