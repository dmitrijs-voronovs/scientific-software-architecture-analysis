",Availability,Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair,Reconfiguration,Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.,"The comment describes a function or method that creates a status message with an error code and a human-readable message, likely used for system feedback or logging. The use of 'status' suggests it's part of a larger system monitoring or reporting mechanism. The term 'error code' indicates that this is related to handling exceptions or errors in the application. The 'human-readable string' implies that the output is intended for end-users rather than developers, which means the message should be clear and informative. The presence of 'msg as a; human-readable string' suggests that there might be multiple parameters involved in constructing the status, possibly with different data types or formats. Overall, this comment appears to be part of a utility function that simplifies error handling and status reporting in the application."

- Defer binding: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Separate the User Interface') Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.
- Cancel: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Support User Initiative') Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- Undo: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Support User Initiative') Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- Pause/resume: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Support User Initiative') Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- Aggregate: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Support User Initiative') Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.
- Maintain task model: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Support System Initiative') Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- Maintain user model: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Support System Initiative') Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- Maintain system model: (quality attribute 'Usability', category 'Support System Initiative') Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.
- Metering: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Monitoring') Collecting data about the energy consumption of computational devices via a sensor infrastructure in real time.
- Static Classification: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Monitoring') Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- Dynamic Classification: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Monitoring') Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- Vertical Scaling: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Allocation') Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- Horizontal Scaling: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Allocation') Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- Scheduling: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Allocation') Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- Brokering: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Allocation') Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.
- Service Adaptation: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Adaptation') Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- Increase Efficiency: (quality attribute 'Energy Efficiency', category 'Resource Adaptation') Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.

""""""""Make a PNG and show it from a numpy array of dtype=np.uint8. Args:; arr: numpy array. Input array to save.; path: str. File path at which to save the image. A .png prefix is added if; the path does not already have one. Leave empty to save at /tmp/tmp.png,; which is useful when only temporarily showing the image in a Colab; notebook.; image_mode: ""RGB"" or ""L"". Leave as default=None to choose based on image; dimensions.; show: bool. Whether to display the image using IPython (for notebooks).; labels: list of str. Labels to show across the top of the image.; scale: integer. Number of pixels wide and tall to show each cell in the; array. This sizes up the image while keeping exactly the same number of; pixels for every cell in the array, preserving resolution and preventing; any interpolation or overlapping of pixels. Default None adapts to the; size of the image to multiply it up until a limit of 500 pixels, a; convenient size for use in notebooks. If saving to a file for automated; processing, scale=1 is recommended to keep output files small and simple; while still retaining all the information content. Returns:; None. Saves an image at path and optionally shows it with IPython.display.; """"""""
