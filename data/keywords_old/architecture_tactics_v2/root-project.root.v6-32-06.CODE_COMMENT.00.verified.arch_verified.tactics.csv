",Modifiability,Reduce Coupling,Use an Intermediary,Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.,"The text describes how to limit data processing in an RDataFrame by using ranges, which allow filtering and transformation operations to be applied selectively. The key points are:
1. Ranges can be specified at various stages of the data processing chain.
2. When a range is used after a filter, it only processes entries that pass the filter.
3. Multiple actions (like filters or histograms) can be executed in a single event loop by leveraging lazy evaluation.

The text provides examples on how to create ranges for specific subsets of data and demonstrates how multiple operations can be combined efficiently."

",Energy Efficiency,Resource Allocation,Scheduling,Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.,"The text discusses how shifting operations can be distributed and how this affects error terms in a computation. It mentions the use of pre(2) which likely refers to some form of pre-processing or initialization related to binary operations. The process involves manipulating variables o_h, E, and e' to reorganize the expression into a form that satisfies certain conditions, possibly for mathematical proofs or error correction. This seems to involve algebraic manipulation and understanding of how bitwise operations affect the overall computation."

The mention of 'Drag and Drag' likely refers to drag-and-drop functionality. The code allows for creating partially transparent windows, which is useful for UI elements that need a semi-transparent appearance.
