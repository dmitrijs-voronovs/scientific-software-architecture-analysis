In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The linker simply performs; a string overlap - based search (char-3grams) on named entities, comparing them with the concepts in a knowledge base; using an approximate nearest neighbours search. Currently (v2.5.0), there are 5 supported linkers:. - `umls`: Links to the [Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html), levels 0,1,2 and 9. This has ~3M concepts.; - `mesh`: Links to the [Medical Subject Headings](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html).

You can access the list of abbreviations via the `doc._.abbreviations` attribute and for a given abbreviation,; you can access it's long form (which is a `spacy.tokens.Span`) using `span._.long_form`, which will point to; another span in the document. #### Example Usage; ```python; import spacy. from scispacy.abbreviation import AbbreviationDetector. nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""). # Add the abbreviation pipe to the spacy pipeline.; nlp.add_pipe(""abbreviation_detector""). doc = nlp(""Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \; inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \; of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \; SBMA can be caused by this easily.""). print(""Abbreviation"", ""\t"", ""Definition""); for abrv in doc._.abbreviations:; 	print(f""{abrv} \t ({abrv.start}, {abrv.end}) {abrv._.long_form}""). >>> Abbreviation	 Span	 Definition; >>> SBMA 		 (33, 34) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> SBMA 	 	 (6, 7) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> AR 		 (29, 30) androgen receptor; ```. > **Note**; > If you want to be able to [serialize your `doc` objects](""
