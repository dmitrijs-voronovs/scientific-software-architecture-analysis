- Dynamic Classification: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- Vertical Scaling: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- Horizontal Scaling: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- Scheduling: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- Brokering: Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.
- Service Adaptation: Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- Increase Efficiency: Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.

",Security,Resist Attacks,Change Default Settings,Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.,"To prevent attackers from using publicly available default settings that could be exploited, such as a missing or default password, we should modify or remove default configurations. Specifically, adding a progress bar in the HTTP get functionality would alter standard defaults, encouraging users to set up their own progress bars if they choose not to use the default. This forces potential attackers to either adjust their tactics or find another point of entry, thereby reducing the system's exposure and increasing security."
