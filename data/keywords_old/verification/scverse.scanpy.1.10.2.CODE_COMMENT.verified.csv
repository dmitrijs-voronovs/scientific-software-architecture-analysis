Content: """"""\; Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells (MAGIC) API :cite:p:`vanDijk2018`. MAGIC is an algorithm for denoising and transcript recover of single cells; applied to single-cell sequencing data.

The algorithm implemented here has changed primarily in two ways; compared to the algorithm described in :cite:t:`vanDijk2018`. Firstly, we use; the adaptive kernel described in :cite:t:`Moon2019` for; improved stability. Secondly, data diffusion is applied; in the PCA space, rather than the data space, for speed and; memory improvements.

Content: ale the width of each violin.; If 'width' (the default), each violin will have the same width.; If 'area', each violin will have the same area.; If 'count', a violin’s width corresponds to the number of observations.; yticklabels; Set to true to view the y tick labels.; row_palette; Be default, median values are mapped to the violin color using a; color map (see `cmap` argument). Alternatively, a 'row_palette` can; be given to color each violin plot row using a different colors.; The value should be a valid seaborn or matplotlib palette name; (see :func:`~seaborn.color_palette`).; Alternatively, a single color name or hex value can be passed,; e.g. `'red'` or `'#cc33ff'`.; {show_save_ax}; {vminmax}; kwds; Are passed to :func:`~seaborn.violinplot`.

Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: """"""\; Makes a *dot plot* of the expression values of `var_names`. For each var_name and each `groupby` category a dot is plotted.; Each dot represents two values: mean expression within each category; (visualized by color) and fraction of cells expressing the `var_name` in the; category (visualized by the size of the dot). If `groupby` is not given,; the dotplot assumes that all data belongs to a single category. .. note::; A gene is considered expressed if the expression value in the `adata` (or; `adata.raw`) is above the specified threshold which is zero by default. An example of dotplot usage is to visualize, for multiple marker genes,; the mean value and the percentage of cells expressing the gene; across multiple clusters. This function provides a convenient interface to the :class:`~scanpy.pl.DotPlot`; class. If you need more flexibility, you should use :class:`~scanpy.pl.DotPlot`; directly. Parameters; ----------; {common_plot_args}; {groupby_plots_args}; size_title; Title for the size legend.

Content: ###############################################################################; # Calculation; ###############################################################################; # Some notes on the implementation:; # * This could be phrased as tensor multiplication. However that does not get; # parallelized, which boosts performance almost linearly with cores.; # * Due to the umap setting the default threading backend, a parallel numba; # function that calls another parallel numba function can get stuck. This; # ends up meaning code re-use will be limited until umap 0.4.; # See: https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues/306; # * There can be a fair amount of numerical instability here (big reductions),; # so data is cast to float64.
