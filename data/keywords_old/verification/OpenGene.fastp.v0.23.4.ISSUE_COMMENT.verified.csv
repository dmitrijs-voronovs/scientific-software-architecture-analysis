It is additionally crucial, in cluster/HPC environments that the number of total threads always be at most the number specified, and ideally be exactly that number for as much of the pipeline as possible.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content: Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you. Thanks!

",True,"The provided content discusses issues with Fastp and FastQC regarding adapter sequences for reads in a sequencing library. It mentions that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, leading to adapters being detected differently by each tool. This involves monitoring and handling of resource use (adapter sequences) in the context of software tools, which relates to energy efficiency as it pertains to efficient processing and resource allocation within computational workflows."

Integrability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.

Modifiability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: Just saw this. I think it would be useful to include multiple adapter feature. My colleagues are stick with Trimmomatic simply because of this. . Stephen Turner just added a collection of adapters in [this repo](https://github.com/stephenturner/adapters). May be worth implementing in the new version of fastp.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The user mentions adding adapters and refers to their implementation by Stephen Turner in a specific repository. This indicates an intention to modify the system by integrating adapter features, which aligns with modifiability as it involves adapting the system to new environments and components."

But this GC content filter, seems not commonly wanted, so I decided not to implement it to make fastp simple and easy. If you want to filter polyA, you can use the newly introduced --adapter_fasta to add polyA in a adapter FASTA file. And for GC, I suspect that they are most G, right?.

Safety,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is.

Please be noted that `--cut_front` will interfere deduplication for both PE/SE data, and `--cut_tail` will interfere deduplication for SE data, since the deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs. If you don't set window size and mean quality threshold for these function respectively, `fastp` will use the values from `-W, --cut_window_size` and `-M, --cut_mean_quality `

Usability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"".

Content: Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1.
