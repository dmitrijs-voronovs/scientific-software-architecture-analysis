Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: Several small issues came up in the forum, and this is a collection of documentation updates, a few safety checks added to roofit and more understandable warning/error messages. Further, the class RooRealProxy (kind of a pointer with extra functionality) has been replaced by a templated class, as it always requires casting when the pointed-to object is used. Since it is internal to RooFit, this should not affect users.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content discusses changes made in RooFit, such as adding safety checks and improving documentation, which relates to ensuring systems can be integrated with others smoothly. The replacement of a class with a templated one might reduce complexity and improve compatibility, contributing to integrability."

Therefore, it was a bit awkward to check if ZeroMQ had that feature. Now that it's released, we can just do a proper cmake version check. The only caveat is that ZeroMQ needs to be built with `-DENABLE_DRAFTS`; to work for `roofit_multiprocess`, which is explained in the build; options documentation. Also, move some compilation flags to specifically RooFitZMQ, where they; are needed. This PR superseeds two other PRs:; * https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13995; * https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9473

Consider the following test case:. test.c; ```cpp; #include ""TInterpreter.h""; #include ""TClass.h""; #include ""TMethod.h""; #include <iostream>; #include <boost/histogram.hpp>. int test() {; auto ns = TClass::GetClass(""boost::histogram"");; auto meth = ns->GetMethodWithPrototype(""make_histogram"", ""boost::histogram::axis::regular<>&&"");. std::cout << ""meth->GetReturnTypeName(): "" << meth->GetReturnTypeName() << std::endl;; std::cout << ""meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName(): "" << meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName() << std::endl;. auto cl = TClass::GetClass(meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName().c_str());; std::cout << ""cl: "" << cl << std::endl;. return 0;; }; ```. output:; ```; meth->GetReturnTypeName(): boost::histogram::histogram<tuple<boost::histogram::axis::regular<double,boost::use_default,boost::use_default,boost::use_default> >,boost::histogram::unlimited_storage<allocator<char> > >; meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName(): boost::histogram::histogram<tuple<regular<double,use_default,use_default,use_default> >,unlimited_storage<allocator<char> > >; cl: 0; (int) 0; ```. So note that the normalized return type is missing the ```boost::histogram``` namespace for the template arguments of the std::tuple. (and then obviously trying to lookup the type again fails). This prevents properly calling this function and other similar ones from PyROOT because the normalized return type is used e.g. here https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/4483b01b7f4bad47332f98d773dbd9b8c7f36b9d/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy-backend/clingwrapper/src/clingwrapper.cxx#L1515

",True,"The provided content discusses an issue where the Boost Histogram library functions have trouble being called from PyROOT due to name normalization problems in C++ code. It includes test cases that demonstrate how the return type of a method, after normalization, lacks the necessary namespace qualifiers (boost::histogram), causing lookup failures. This problem affects the integrability of the system as it hinders proper function calls and integration with other components, such as Python bindings. The issue involves technical challenges in ensuring compatibility and ease of combination between different systems/components, aligning with the definition of Integrability which focuses on integration complexity and interface compatibility."

As a result, the example above will now output a file like this:. ```; $ rootls -l myfile.root; TH1F Aug 21 11:00 2021 myhistoname;1 ""myhistotitle""; ```. The already present method is modified with SFINAE as well, to only be available if the type T of the template is not derived from TObject.

",True,"The content discusses issues related to how objects are written to files, specifically regarding their titles and whether they're properly set by the WriteObject method in TDirectory. This ties into the system's ability to integrate components correctly (e.g., ensuring that derived classes from TObject have proper handling). The problem is resolved by modifying the WriteObject method to use a specific overload when dealing with objects derived from TObject, thereby correctly setting their titles. This indicates that the software's integration capabilities are being addressed and improved, aligning with the Integrability quality attribute."

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: The current implementation of the PyMVA interface in `PyMethodBase` has following problem:. We are using currently a global local python namespace for **all** instances of **all** PyMVA method. So you can easily interfere with an other method running in the same factory. Most likely, this happens if you book two instances of the same method in one factory. We can solve this by introducing **private** local python namespaces. In this version, we are sharing the global namespaces with all instances of a PyMVA method (and ofc the running python instance), but create a seperate local namespace for each instance. So you can do whatever you want in your method/instance and you don't interfere with others.

Indeed, there are error messages when a PDF is not; extendible, but it would be better to throw an exception because this is; an error that will certainly break your model. This change is inspired by the following forum post:; https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/roofftconvpdf-not-working-in-product-with-rooaddpdf-even-in-new-root-versions/51442. One user error that resulted in the post was using the no-coefficient constructor with non-extendible PDFs, which would have been prevented by throwing an error as suggested in this PR.

Currently, just parses the user arguments in the `__init__` method and stores the needed attributes. My idea is that in the end we'll only need to store `npartitions` and `tree` (which are always needed) plus `defaultbranches` and `friendinfo` as ""optional"" class attributes (meaning they are initialized to `None` and changed if some conditions apply). . For simplicity, in this PR I still leave `treename` and `inputfiles` attributes which are needed in the `Ranges.get_clusters` function. The next PRs will address:; * The assumption we only have one unique treename in the RDataFrame; * Change in `Ranges.get_clusters` to accept a `TTree` instance as argument, pairing it with new C++ functions in `ROOT::Internal::TreeUtils` to retrieve a vector of clusters (plus some other metadata) depending if it's a TTree or TChain. If the logic for this PR is approved I'll add more docs and commit messages
