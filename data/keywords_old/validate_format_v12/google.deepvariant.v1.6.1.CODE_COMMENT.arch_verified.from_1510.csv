You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:

- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).

 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

For `TFRecord` files, ending in a '.gz' suffix causes the file to be treated as; compressed with gzip. Notes on using CRAM with SamReader; --------------------------------. Nucleus supports reading from CRAM files using the same API as for SAM/BAM:. ```python; from third_party.nucleus.io import sam. with sam.SamReader(""/path/to/sample.cram"") as reader:; for read in reader:; print(read); ```. There is one type of CRAM file, though, that has a slightly more complicated; API. If the CRAM file uses read sequence compression with an external reference; file, and this reference file is no longer accessible in the location specified; by the CRAM file's ""UR"" tag and cannot be found in the local genome cache, its; location must be passed to SamReader via the ref_path parameter:. ```python; from third_party.nucleus.io import sam. cram_path = ""/path/to/sample.cram""; ref_path = ""/path/to/genome.fasta""; with sam.SamReader(cram_path, ref_path=ref_path) as reader:; for read in reader:; print(read); ```. Unfortunately, htslib is unable to load the ref_path from anything other than a; POSIX filesystem. (htslib plugin filesystems like S3 or GCS buckets won't work).; For that reason, we don't recommend the use of CRAM files with external; reference files, but instead suggest using read sequence compression with; embedded reference data. (This has a minor impact on file size, but; significantly improves file access simplicity and safety.).

cord` file is assumed and attempted to be; read or written. Otherwise, the filename is treated as a true SAM/BAM/CRAM file. For `TFRecord` files, ending in a '.gz' suffix causes the file to be treated as; compressed with gzip. Notes on using CRAM with SamReader; --------------------------------. Nucleus supports reading from CRAM files using the same API as for SAM/BAM:. ```python; from third_party.nucleus.io import sam. with sam.SamReader(""/path/to/sample.cram"") as reader:; for read in reader:; print(read); ```. There is one type of CRAM file, though, that has a slightly more complicated; API. If the CRAM file uses read sequence compression with an external reference; file, and this reference file is no longer accessible in the location specified; by the CRAM file's ""UR"" tag and cannot be found in the local genome cache, its; location must be passed to SamReader via the ref_path parameter:. ```python; from third_party.nucleus.io import sam. cram_path = ""/path/to/sample.cram""; ref_path = ""/path/to/genome.fasta""; with sam.SamReader(cram_path, ref_path=ref_path) as reader:; for read in reader:; print(read); ```. Unfortunately, htslib is unable to load the ref_path from anything other than a; POSIX filesystem. (htslib plugin filesystems like S3 or GCS buckets won't work).; For that reason, we don't recommend the use of CRAM files with external; reference files, but instead suggest using read sequence compression with; embedded reference data. (This has a minor impact on file size, but; significantly improves file access simplicity and safety.). For more information about CRAM, see:; * The `samtools` documentation at http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html; * The ""Global Options"" section of the samtools docs at http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#GLOBAL_OPTIONS; * How reference sequences are encoded in CRAM at http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html#REFERENCE_SEQUENCES; * Finally, benchmarking of different CRAM options http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/CRAM.html; """"""

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**
ts up; those lists into groups that respect the requirements of the max_group_size; and max_separation arguments. This is necessary because the labeling algorithm; is very expensive as a function of the number of input variants, so to avoid; excessive runtime we break up our potentially large list of candidate and; truth variants into smaller groups (max number controlled by max_group_size); based on a maximum distance allowed between the closest variants within the; group. The current algorithm is a simple greedy one; we effectively merge the two; variant lists together, make groups greedily on that list until either the; maximum number of elements of a specific type (i.e., max_group_size of 2; implies we can have up to two candidate variants or truth variants within a; group) or we encounter a variant further away from the closest variant within; the current group than allowed by max_separation. Args:; candidates: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of candidate variants; on the same chromosome.; truths: list[nucleus.proto.Variant]. A sorted list of truth variants on the; same chromosome.; max_group_size: int >= 0. The maximum number of variants of a specific type; allowed within a group.; max_separation: int >= 0. The maximum distance, in basepairs, allowed; between the closest variants within a group.; max_gt_options_product: int >= 0. The maximum number of combinations of; genotypes (product of all genotypes in the group).; force_group_within_bp: int >= 0. Variants within this many bps will be; forced to be put in the same group. This is to ensure that we do not; decouple candidates and truths in variant-dense regions. This value can be; set to -1 for unit-test purposes. Setting -1 will not force any grouping; of variants. Returns:; A list of grouped variants in 2-tuples, such as:. [(candidates1, truth_variants1), ...]. where each tuple contains the candidate and truth variants for that group.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted

reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.
