You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

**Content to evaluate:**
sure, we’ll talk in 10 days or so, after my holidays 😄. except if you want to earlier, then we can skype or so. > One could think about renaming the ""data"" subdirectory to something like ""data_cache"" or so to make evident that this only stores cache files, which can simply be deleted, and everything else stores ""AnnData backing files"" = ""result files"" or exported files... definitely. > But I agree true cache files might be better placed in a tmp directory. no, as i said: cache directory, not temp directory. both have (overridable) standard locations on all OSs. e.g. on linux:. - `$TMPDIR` or `/tmp/`: temporary means that the files are only to be read during the same function/script execution, and deleted after. temp files forgotten by the application that created them are deleted after `$TMPTIME` and on reboot. (on linux now usually because `/tmp/` is a ramdisk and RAM contents don’t survive a reboot). ```py; # python gives you a context manager that deletes the file after its block; with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as fp:; use(fp); # fp and the file are gone now; ```. - `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `~/.cache/`: cache files are permanent until the user or OS cleans up or the application decides it no longer needs them (i think e.g. browsers clear out the parts of their cache periodically). since scanpy has a notion of a project directory, putting the cache there is OK as well. the advantage is visibility, but that only works if the user knows what the directory/ies are for. using `cache` in the name of the cache directory would certainly help to signify that the stuff can be safely deleted.

Usability,"t: `adata[:, adata.var_names[0]].X` to be one dimensional?. This used to be the behaviour, but it got confusing quickly. Suddenly, `adata.X` could be a different shape from `adata`. I would recommend reading the issues that were opened about this on `anndata` for more context. Here's one of the main ones: https://github.com/theislab/anndata/issues/145. Another issue is that `scipy.sparse` has no such thing as a 1-dimensional sparse array. This is a long standing problem, which I'll write a bit more about in the context of xarray. ### 3. .var_vector doesn't return a Series. I remeber thinking about this as a possibility. IIRC I decided against this because I just as frequently wanted some other column, like `""gene_symbols""` as the index. I could see adding this as an option via a keyword argument now. But maybe you just want to use `sc.get.obs_df`?. ### 4. Clusters as categories creates confusing scatterplots. Well, there is no order to the categories, so I guess I see why `matplotlib` wouldn't plot those in sorted order, but agree it's a little counter intuitive. Seems like more of a matplotlib issue to me though. ### 5. Cannot pass clusters to c parameter in plt.scatter. Use one of these?. ```python; sc.pl.scatter(pbmc, x=pbmc.var_names[0], y=pbmc.var_names[1], color=""leiden"") . import seaborn as sns; sns.scatterplot(pbmc.X[:, 0], pbmc.X[:, 0], hue=pbmc.obs[""leiden""]); ```. Categorical values for scatter plots are a known issue for matplotlib, as I linked to above. Their current behaviour if you pass a numeric valued categorical (regardless of whether it's ordered) is to use a continuous color palette, which in my opinion is easily misleading. ### 6. Clusters as categories frustrate subclustering. We've used a different convention for subclustering, which is actually the reason we use strings. We're assuming you're breaking a cluster or set of clusters into smaller ones, so the new id is appended to the old one. I believe there's a tutorial with this somewhere.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

Otherwise, it would be `sc.experimental.pp.pearson_deviant_genes ` -> `sc.pp.highly_variable_genes` , which I don't think it is a smooth transition. ; If/when we eventually refactor `highly_variable_genes`, it wouldn't matter (there would be changes in function name anyway), but then again we'd have to consider backward compatibility as well. Furthermore, as it is now, it is true that it's the same `highly_variable_genes` API, but it belongs to the experimental module. Therefore, users would/should not assume the same functionality.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You could potentially keep all the default parameters as you have now in scanpy (even though I would not recommend it, see below). However, what I said about using pre-build kNN graph requires some thinking. T-SNE uses perplexity=30 by default and uses kNN graph with k=3*perplexity, so that's 90 by default. UMAP uses k=15 and that's what you use in scanpy by default too. I can see three options here:. i) Let openTSNE do its own thing and ignore the kNN graph built in scanpy. Advantage: that's what you do now. Disadvantage: not very consistent architecture IMHO. . ii) Use the kNN graph built in scanpy and query() it to get 90 neighbors. Disadvantage: can be a bit slow. But I think it's better than (i). iii) Run t-SNE using 15 neighbors. Turns out, t-SNE with uniform affinities across 15 neigbours is *extremely* similar to t-SNE with perplexity 30. Evidence: https://twitter.com/hippopedoid/status/1232698023253303298. So you could run this version of t-SNE with uniform kernel. This will be very fast. Regarding default parameters: learning rate = 1000 that you use by default is simply not enough for large data (sample size in millions), as shown in that Nat Comms paper in detail. If you want to keep it for compatibility reasons, that's your choice, but be aware that you are getting suboptimal tSNE embeddings.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts intended mainly for machines or formal structure.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, critiques, or explanations of implementation/optimization strategies.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized (e.g., detailed explanations of model architecture, reasoning behind design choices, analysis of outcomes).
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, string literals in config files, documentation sections within code) **as long as the natural language prose component is substantial and provides meaningful human-readable context or explanation.**

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking significant natural language explanation or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations, pure boolean logic like `if (x > 5) { y = 1; }` without explanation).
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces:** Content generated by programs (like build tools, compilers, runtime environments) for diagnostic or reporting purposes, characterized by structured formats, timestamps, error codes, etc., and **distinguished by the absence of substantial human-authored explanations or narrative.**
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data structures, simple Makefile rules, compiler flags lists without descriptive text).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, merge conflict markers, simple file path changes without a descriptive commit message).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions without accompanying prose** (e.g., `def my_function(param1: int) -> str:` without a docstring explaining *what* the function does or *why*).

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures, which are diagnostic artifacts, not human-readable prose explaining a concept.

### Example 2
**Content:** recision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Primarily a formal technical specification of syntax with only minimal natural language labeling, not a substantial explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

### Example 6
**Content:** # Configure the learning rate using an exponential decay.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Although formatted as a code comment, the content is natural language providing a meaningful explanation of a technical strategy and its purpose.
