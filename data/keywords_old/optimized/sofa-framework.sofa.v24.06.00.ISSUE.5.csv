Security,"3 scenes were displaying an error following the PR #2465 . After some investigations, it appeared that those 3 scenes were not working for a while (and the PR merely showed that statement), and the culprit was that GridMeshCreator was not calling its doLoad() method.; doLoad() in MeshLoader components is triggered when d_filename is set.; But GridMeshCreator is procedural and does not any filename at all. Therefore doLoad() was never called.; This PR forcefully set the data d_filename to dirty to force-trigger the callback. Moreover, insertTriangle and insertQuad were using beginEdit()/endEdit() which were triggering also a doLoad() (resulting in a lot of useless edges/triangles); This PR uses WriteOnlyAccessor to avoid this problem.

Security,"A new DataEngine is introduced: `FillReducingOrdering`. A DataEngine to reorder the degrees of freedom in a mesh in order to reduce fill-in in sparse matrix factorization. In other terms, the algorithm minimizes the number of non-zeros entries in the factorization of the sparse matrix of a FEM problem by reordering the degrees of freedom. The implementation is based on METIS. Note: some of the direct linear solvers embed such a reordering internally (e.g. SparseLDLSolver), but not all of them (e.g SparseLUSolver, SparseCholeskySolver etc). An example is also introduced (`examples/Components/engine/FillReducingOrdering.scn`).; Here is the comparison of the two system matrices:. Initial matrix:; ![initial_matrix00001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10572752/143068764-2cbd09b4-906b-4bc1-b3c6-03cd3034a1ab.jpg).

It improves a lot the performances when the linear solver does not embed a fill-in reducing reordering. This is the case of the `SparseLUSolver` in the example scene.; Rough framerate without reordering: **2.5 FPS**; Rough framerate with reordering: **25 FPS**; ______________________________________________________.

Security,"Add two types in sofa: only header files that are not (yet) used by other components. ; The DataCallback allows to call a specific function after any modification of a data. in the declaration of the class ; ```; Data<double> d_data; DataCallback c_data; // I usually prefix with c_; ```. At the initialization of the constructor:; ```; : d_diff(initData(&d_diff, ""name"", ""desc"")); , c_diff(d_diff) // listen to d_diff data. The constructor of the DataCallback takes a data as reference; ```. Then anywhere (usually in the constructor body); ```; c_diff.addCallback(this,&MyComponent::myfunction1); ; c_diff.addCallback(this,&MyComponent::myfunction2); ; ```. The main difference with an existing type in sofa if the possibility to attach several functions and more importantly to specify the component on which the callback will be called. This allows to define callbacks as member functions of the component, which simplify access to parameters. Additional test are added allowing to modify the data while the callback is called (in order to avoid cyclic calls). This is usefull for linked data i.e. The callback receives a modification from the parent, the callback is then called and it is allowed to modify the data in the callback which will automatically call update of childs of the data. . The second type introduced in this PR is a wrapper allowing to easily associate a widget with a specific types of data. It can be used as follows: . in a cpp file; `sofa::helper::Creator<sofa::gui::qt::DataWidgetFactory, GenericDataWidget< Data<bool>, QtDataBoxEdit > >	DWClass_bool(""bool"",true);`. QtDataBoxEdit is a Qwidget class defined by the user that needs to define usual functions needed in sofa widgets : ; ```; void readFromData(const Data<bool>& data);; void writeToData(Data<bool>& data);; ```. And constructor must take as parameter the parent and the data as follows :; `QtDataBoxEdit(sofa::gui::qt::DataWidget* parent,const sofa::core::objectmodel::Data<bool> & data) : QCheckBox(parent)",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/911:926,access,access,926,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/911,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"An example is introduced for SquareMapping. In this scene, the goal was to verify that two methods are equivalent:; 1) A SquaredDistanceMapping is used to transform the DOFs from the 3d space to a 1d space (representing the squared distances between the DOFs). Then a spring acts in the 1d space; 2) A combination of two mappings: DistanceMapping and SquareMapping. It also transforms the 3d space to a 1d space where a spring is added. A unit test is added to check both methods are equivalent. However, we can observe that if the simulation runs long enough, both objects diverge.

Security,"Based on #2043. A new component is introduced: `ParallelBVHNarrowPhase`. As the name suggests, it is the parallel implementation of `BVHNarrowPhase`. ## Details. The broad phase provides a list of pairs of collision models. In the initial `BVHNarrowPhase` component, the list was processed sequentially. In `ParallelBVHNarrowPhase` each pair is processed in a task, which is given to a thread pool. Note that the traversal of the bounding volume hierarchy is not parallel. It is still single threaded. Due to race conditions, some operations must be done prior to the parallel tasks: . 1. Detection output creation. This operation is very time consuming (see #2047). If #2047 is merged, we can expect better results.; 2. Topology initialization. ## Results. The tested scene is `applications/plugins/MultiThreading/examples/ParallelBruteForceBroadPhase.scn` during 500 time steps.

It would require to duplicate code from the base class. Hence a refactoring is needed for a proper implementation (in another PR). Note that `addForce` is usually not the bottleneck. Quick benchmarks show performances improvement on the provided example. I think there is still room for improvement in `addDForce`. But it would require a few changes in the base class. Instead of having a force vector for each task, I suggest to store only the force on the DoFs that have been visited during the task. I am not sure if it will bring more perfs improvements.

The conversion gets triplets and detects duplicates and does the compression. Therefore, all the work to build a matrix is done in the conversion. This work is not required during the accumulation as it is done later in any case. I propose to accumulate all the matrix entries in a simple list. This accumulation does nothing else than inserting a new element in the vector. This should be faster than using a `CompressedRowSparseMatrix`. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"Based on https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3548. In the `addDForce` method, the parallel algorithm consists in computing a thread-specific `dF` and then combine them all in the main `dF`. It requires a synchronisation mechanism as it may create race conditions. This PR introduce an alternative method which is lock-free. It divides the model into smaller subdomains that can be solved in parallel without synchronization. Since the domains are visited sequentially (it's the elements of each domain that are visited in parallel), it comes with an overhead. Therefore, this method is particularly suited for large models where the overhead can be amortized. I have the following results on the provided example:. ```; 1000 steps ; 17775 elements (hexa). domain decomposition:; 35.1703 s ( 28.4331 FPS). naive:; 76.5666 s ( 13.0605 FPS). sequential:; 192.688 s ( 5.18974 FPS).; ```.

Security,"Currently in Sofa we aren't catching any exceptions. . The consequence is that every exception propagates to the top level exception handler halting the application. ; Un-handled exception are useful to detect bugs but this is a non-sense to use such top level handler to process possible application errors like failure to load a plugin or a scene. . A good approach should be that any exception that can be fixed without editting the source code (ie. but by editting the scene or changing some system configuration and so on) should ends with a gracefull error message indicating to the user how to fix the error cause. To implement this I suggest to:; - add a close to top-level try/catch block around simulations/plugin actions; - add a SofaSimulationException that has an error message, the component that emitted it and can have a backtrace as well as a top level reactions to do (eg: set componentstate to invalid and stop simulation). We should also use this SofaSimulationException at any place we are using msg_error(). ; (Actually it could even make sense to replace the msg_error macro by throwing the exception). ______________________________________________________.

But after one year I think our approach also tend to favor trivial ""micro changes"" against complex things. . Because they are hard to read, or review, or because they may eventually break something, big PRs are often rejected. This is a drama and I think that we should make en effort to facilitate much more these one because they contains real work (ie...an engineer spends several days or week that he (and is employer) is willing to offer to the community). Loosing those contributions is just a raw loss for the community. .

There is no need to be super pinchy on two or three micro-details of a 50h PR. (reviewers should instead contribute to the PR by fixing that details); - reviewers should be willing and adapt their reviewing time to the size of the PR.

As you know, one of our main objectives is currently to propose a major evolution of SOFA: this is the project ""SOFA-NG"", standing for Next Gen. ; Let us give you some insight about the final plan and the steps to reach these objectives. Any feedback is welcome. ## Objectives. The final objective of SOFA-NG is to refactorize the current (non-core) modules and components by moving them into plugins. It will permit to:; - compile and load only the necessary modules; - clean all dependencies in SOFA; - help focusing the work of validation/verification/doc/test on specific codes; - improve the packaging of codes; - ease understanding the API of SOFA for new users. ## Steps of implementation. Our concerns; - Focus on non-core components only; - Make the transition as smooth as possible; - Keep the history. Steps to follow; - Propose an architecture and a folder structure; - Decide a place for each component (incrementally); - Create the folder structure in SOFA plugins directory; - Pluginize one by one the components towards their new place. Note that this project; - will be documented, scripts will be provided to help the transition in plugins; - is compatible (can be run in parallel) with the deprecation task. ## Proposed structure. ~~https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/sofang-v0~~; EDIT: latest proposal: https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/sofang-v3.

This is efficient in term of memory but it has the side effect of changing the indices order in the data. ; --> My question is, *is that what we want ?* Do we prefer memory/time efficiency over order coherency for this data ?

The goal of this PR is to remove *TopologyContainer dependencies in TopologyData mechanism.; TopologyHanderData has direct dependencies on *TopologyContainer because it wants to link their specific Data(d_edges, d_triangles, etc) into a list of engines handled by itself.; It should not know how a topology is managing its data IMO.; So this PR:; - is abstracting the function to add a Data to list of engines ; - change the way how the engine lists is managed: each Subclass was setting its engine list (edgeset and then triangleset and then....), now the base class is storing a vector of list of engines (indexed on the type of topology); - removes the direct dependency on TopologyContainer in TopologyHandlerData.inl. After this PR, all Topology*Data mechanism will be moved in to Sofa.Core, along Topology* class (sofa::core::topology).

The replacement of the usage of the GeometryAlgorithms had the unattended consequence that there was not information anymore about the geometry itself (it was hidden before by the geometryAlgorithms having a pointer on the topology before).; Now if one wants to define a geometry type different of the type of the associated state, it can be done by giving a third template (called GeometricalTypes). This template is equal to DataTypes by default if omitted (as it was before). It should fix the scene failing since #2436 (about the diffusion, which is having a geometrical type (Vec3d) different of its associated state (Vec1d).

A base class for TopologicalMapping is introduced (BaseTopologicalMapping). It has no link to topologies. SubsetMultiMapping is now a BaseTopologicalMapping and has MultiLinks for input topologies and output topologies.; The consequence is that SubsetMultiMapping gets the propagation of the topological changes through the visitor `TopologyChangeVisitor`. It does not need any callback and subscribe to any topology. Note that `TopologyChangeVisitor` is now called on the root, rather than on the Node of the topology undergoing changes.

Instead of just reverting to the classical static init, I have put all those inline static to constexpr members, leading to the fact that fixed_array's default constructor was not constexpr (forgotten 😗); Anyway, now everything is constexpr and the inline static initialization is correct now....

The final objective of SOFA-NG is to refactorize the current (non-core) modules and components by moving them into plugins. It will permit to:; - compile and load only the modules we want; - clean all dependencies in SOFA; - help focusing the work of validation/verification/doc/test on specific codes; - improve the packaging of codes; - ease understanding the API of SOFA for new users; - cleaning the applications/plugins repository. ## Tasks. Here are the main steps of the project.; Tasks NG1 and NG2 can be done in parallel if we work ""bottom->top"" in NG1 and ""top->bottom"" in NG2.; Task NG3 can also be started in parallel. We need to iterate on the architecture proposal to refine it as much as possible before steps NG1 and NG2 are over.; Task NG4 cleaning the applications/plugins repository in order to better handle code lifecycle. ### NG1: Simplify headers dependency graph by removing un-needed includes. 1.

Security,"Here, I propose a raw version of Force Field for solving FEM model of Reissner-Mindlin Flat Shell Element (quad element, 5 degrees of freedom). ; Note that, at this current stage, I assume that 2 degrees of freedom related to rotational displacements of a node in x and y-axis (z is the normal axis of the element) are ignored for the purpose of my project. However, I also want to include these components in the calculation but have no clue. Furthermore, only the small displacement method is considered, I just wonder whether we can apply the co-rotational method to this type of element. Since I am not an expert in FEM, the calculation process and coding flow are inspired by many online materials and the TriangularFEMForceField, respectively.

Security,"Hi!. When building plugins as standalone projects, the SofaFramework package doesn't expose the cmake config options used to build SOFA.; In the SoftRobots plugin (among others), tests are performed to know if SOFA has been built using the required options (such as SOFA_BUILD_METIS, MODULE_SOFASPARSESOLVER, PLUGIN_SOFAPYTHON, SOFA_BUILD_TESTS etc.) and out-of-tree configurations require to re-specify those options, even though they are only defined in the SOFA build. I've modified the SofaFrameworkConfig.cmake.in to expose those options to whoever does a find_package(SofaFramework), although that might not be the smartest way to do it (the list is non exhausive and it would be best if options were added in a smarter way.; I think that modules such as SOFASPARSESOLVER should export the MODULE_SOFASPARSESOLVER themselves for instance, and so should the plugins.; But then there's also a long list of options that would be worth exposing, such as:; - SOFA_BUILD_TESTS; - SOFA_BUILD_METIS; - SOFA_BUILD_TUTORIALS; - SOFA_WITH_DEPRECATED_COMPONENTS; - SOFA_WITH_THREADING; - SOFA_WITH_DEVTOOLS; - SOFA_USE_MASK; - ....

Handle cases of several grid cells having the same h index. In such case, the distance between two points, that have the same h index, should be computed only if the points are in the same grid cell. This PR add this implementation. Each element is now stored in the hash table with its corresponding grid cell indices. 2. The nearest point, in a shared grid cell, may not be the global nearest point. To improve that, we detect when neighboring cells may contain a better solution, and do the check.

In any case, whatever the library we choose, we must use openSSL (we request a https). This is the main concern about this PR. In terms of installation, I think Ubuntu and macOS are straightforward because there are packages. But Windows is bit more tricky. The pre-built binaries are not available on the openSSL website. I found them here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html. After installation, I had to define `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`, and add the `bin` folder to my path. In this PR, the newly introduced module is linked only in Sofa.GUI.Qt and the version checker is called at init (for test). A later contribution will use the introduced function to show the latest version in the GUI. Output example:; ```; [INFO] [VersionChecker] You are using the latest version (24.06.99). {272.525 ms}; ```. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"I propose a more readable code for the component BruteForceDetection. It is a crucial component, used in many Sofa scenes, and yet it is hard to understand what it does.; Among the changes I propose:; - Split giant functions into multiple smaller functions; - Give meaningful names to functions, variables and types; - Merge simple operations which was hard to read into simple expressions; - Add a lot of comments. The algorithm stays the same. Note the number of lines is larger than before. It is the price for readability. It is mainly due to the several functions I added.

I chose to rely on Qt because otherwise it requires a new lib for the http request, and Qt is already here. But having Qt is not enough. I have an error related to ssl (similar error to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53805704/tls-initialization-failed-on-get-request). It requires additional components in the Qt installation. I did not try it myself because it changes the installation process of SOFA. So before going further, we need to conclude that this feature is desirable (and is not a gadget). If it is, we can decide to rely on Qt and its additional component, or to go with a simpler C++ library (https://github.com/JosephP91/curlcpp for example).

(If you like coding & navigating through SOFA's codebase without having QtCreator transforming your laptop into an airplane, you should try it, it's great!) ; Anyway, I'd like to suggest adding some stuff to the .gitignore file:. * emacs auto-generates autosave files that have the following formats: `#*` and `~*` ; * When running emacs as an IDE, an emacs package called `projectile` creates a file called `.dir-locals.el`, containing project configuration, compilation, and running instructions for emacs in the project's root folder.; * Finally, Emacs uses `clangd` or `ccls` as its language servers. these programs store their index (LSP data for the project's codebase) in `.cache/` and `.ccls-cache/` respectively. clangd & ccls both require cmake to generate a `compile_commands.json` file, which we also don't want to be committed in the git repository.

Security,"In a mapped state, force fields and masses contribute to the global system matrix via a projection provided by mappings. The term $m M+ k K$ is assembled locally (association with the mapped state), and then the product $J^T (m M+ k K) J$.; However, in most cases, $M$ is constant. In addition, in some cases $J$ is also constant. If we fulfill the conditions so that both $M$ and $J$ are constants, we can extract the product $J^T M J$ and pre-compute it once at the beginning of the simulation. This is what this PR does. In addition to the pre-computation, there is a cache invalidation mechanism on masses to track when $M$ is subject to changes. For example, changes in the mass parameter by the user. This pre-computation is the most efficient when there is a difference of sparsity between $M$ and $K$. And this is the case when hyper-reduction is involved. $K$ is super sparse (only a few elements are considered), while $M$ gets contributions from all the nodes of the detailed mesh.

Security,"In order to implement damping behavior on a system, we can use rayleigh damping or we can use a more powerful feature, the dissipation potentials. These potentials implement a force that depends on the velocity. . https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10092361; http://gmrv.es/Publications/2018/SO18/EGauthorGuidelines-sca2018-sub.pdf. The first paper specifies how should these potentials be integrated into an optimization solver and the second one specifies how these potential should be to correctly damp the desired deformation modes. . In particular, we need to compute the dissipation rate, measures as the `dt * R(x, v)`. We also need to compute the damping forces (dR/dv) and the damping hessians (d2R/dvdx and d2R/dv2). With the current implementation of the ForceFields, we can implement the forces and the hessians, but we can't implement the dissipation rate because we don't have access to dt. . The `MechanicalParams` that is passed into the getPotentialEnergy function is the default instance, and that one doesn't have the dt set. . My proposal is to add a getDissipationRate function to the ForceField so we can pass the dt and separate the computation of the potential energy and the dissipation rate.",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2335:890,access,access,890,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2335,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"In the `getValuePtr` methods, a buffer on vector data is obtained by actually returning a reference to the vector first element. However the case where the method is called on an empty (but valid) vector is not handled. This may lead to an execution error, for instance when using SofaPython3 to assign values to a component's Data dynamically. This specific scenario is the object of a second PR in SofaPython3 [(link to the PR)](https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/318). To change this, we propose to use the `std::vector.data()` method, which handles the case when the vector is actually empty (however returning a pointer that may or may not be null). All unit tests work on my setup with this modification. However I don't fully understand the consequences of a change at this depth in SOFA's core, so additional opinions would be useful. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"In this PR, `map_ptr_stable_compare` is preferred over `unordered_map`, as it allows reproducible contact response. However, `unordered_map` is still a lot faster. #2047 leads to a crash in `examples/Components/collision/RayTraceCollision.scn`. I suspect the cause of this crash existed before #2047, and that #2047 revealed the crash by processing the contacts in a non-deterministic order. With the non-deterministic order, I can see that the crash does not happen always at the same current time step. It even happened that there was no crash. Currently, I am not able to fix the crash. But I will continue investigating. As a workaround I restore the stable map to have deterministic contacts. IMO, it hides the cause of the crash.

Security,"Investigation from the problem I got with regression, which was that the sofa::component::init(); In GCC, it was crashing, whereas on clang/msvc it was not. After debugging, it appears that there was a infinite loop when calling all the init() of the submodules.; E.g Sofa.Component calls sofa::component::collision::init() which calls initExternalModule of Sofa.Component.Collision. ; But with gcc, it was not calling initExternalModule() of Sofa.Component.Collision but the one of Sofa.Component. and then tries to call again init() etc. I suspect problems with demangling the function name in the binary (extern ""C"") and stuff like that, but I did not go further.; The solution anyway is to put the call of the initialization in init() and not in initExternalModule() (and not vice versa). ______________________________________________________.

Introduces to regroup all these operations instead of having *GeometricAlgorithms etc. **Not linked to any topology**. It is mostly empty for the moment.; - Sofa.Topology: defining how is define an Element (triangle, etc). ; Historically in SOFA, elements are defined as a vector of Indices. So this module regroups mainly what was in core/Topology.h and set each Element its own files (h/cpp). I suppose this is where *TopologyAlgorithms will lie in the future. ## Breaking; Nope, or nothing that I am aware of. ## Discussion; - Naming: both of those module (and namespace) has a Triangle/Edge/etc: e.g sofa::geometry::Triangle and sofa::topology::Triangle.; This may be confusing, especially without the namespace.; - See in the future how to link these modules with the much awaited [Caribou ](https://github.com/jnbrunet/caribou) plugin. ## Thanks; - @epernod ; - @jnbrunet ; ______________________________________________________.

Security,"It is preferable to force the `constexpr` context:. ```cpp; static constexpr ResolutionMethod NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient(""NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient"");; if (d_resolutionMethod.getValue() != NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient); {; ```. The compiler may not choose to use `constexpr` in:. ```cpp; if (d_resolutionMethod.getValue() != ResolutionMethod(""NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient"")); {; ```. Therefore, no `constexpr` check if `NonsmoothNonlinearConjugateGradient` is not in the list. There is a runtime check though. The type allows to deprecate a key if desired (I am thinking about the Data `method` in the FEM force fields). There is also a description of each key. And the whole list (key + description) can be added easily in the description of the Data, hence in the documentation. The major problem is about the GUI. More particularly, when a Data is read to be displayed in the GUI. Here, each of the `SelectableItem` is a new strong type. So there is no `DataTypeName`, `DataTypeInfo` etc for the new type. I tried to factorize with a common base class (`BaseSelectableItem`) but without success. I tried to define `DataTypeName`, `DataTypeInfo` etc for `SelectedItem` but without success. The consequence is that I cannot specialize a widget for this type of Data. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"Most of the components in `Sofa.Core/behavior` work by accessing one or more mechanical states, in order to access state variables, such as position, force etc. They all manage their own way to store, find and manage their link to one or more mechanical states. Instead, I suggest to factorize this access using intermediate classes. It comes with the following features:. - All components inherit from `StateAccessor`, which contains a dynamic list of `BaseMechanicalState`; - Components having access to only one mechanical state inherit from `SingleStateAccessor`. It is templated on `DataTypes`, with a link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes>`.; - Components having access to 2 mechanical states inherit from `PairStateAccessor`. It is templated on `DataTypes1` and `DataTypes2`, with a link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes1>` and a second link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes2>`.; - Components inheriting from `SingleStateAccessor` or `PairStateAccessor` fill the dynamic list contained in the `StateAccessor` implementation.; - It does not break the previous accesses, variable names etc. The goal is that all the components accessing a `BaseMechanicalState` can provide a list of them in a generic way. For example, `BaseInteractionForceField` supposed only 2 mechanical states. Since it inherits now from `StateAccessor`, it can have links to more than 2 (note that none of the interaction force field I found work with more than 2). Another example: `BaseForceField` did not have any reference to a mechanical state, but all the force fields inherits from `ForceField` which has a link to a mechanical state. Therefore, we couldn't have access to a mechanical state from a `BaseForceField`. I also cleaned the files:; - Concatenate nested namespaces; - Use `#pragma once`; - Some private and non-defined copy constructors and `operator=` are marked `delete`.; - Move methods in cpp; - Removed unnecessary `init()` implementations.

Security,"Remove damping correction to the RHS because it is already added in the computeForce. In a Euler implicit integration scheme, the right hand side expression only contains terms coming for the internal and external forces taken at the begining of the timestep, and an inertial term constituted of the stiffness matrix, but no term coming from the constitutive damping. (see [Christian Duriez HDR](https://theses.hal.science/tel-00785118) for ref). The contribution of the damping forcefield is already taken into account through the `computeForce` call line 126, so the `b` coefficient should be put to 0 here otherwise the behavior is not correct. . This can bee reproduced by launching the scene `examples/Component/SolidMechanics/FEM/DampingForceField.scn` and putting the data `implicit` of the damping forcefield to true. This data might have been introduced to fix this error, because here we are in an implicit scheme, and setting this parameter to true when the `b` coef is equal to 1 changes the behavior. .

Security,"TaskScheduler was doing several things:; - A base class for task schedulers; - A factory to register and create task schedulers.

I refactored a bit how the factory works:; Before, it was like there could be only one TaskScheduler at a time. Everytime a new TaskScheduler was created, the previous one is destroyed. It prevents the use of multiple TaskScheduler with different type (derived class). Instead, the task schedulers are now stored in a map. ; The only issue is related to the task allocator. The task allocator is used every time a task is created. The task allocator is supposed to depend on the TaskScheduler where the task will be added.

Security,"The PSDE works similar to a function block in Simulink or comparable software. The user can define a block (a PSDE) declaring its Inputs, Outputs (I/Os) and its behavior using Python alone. It has some similarities with the ""PythonScriptController"" (PSC). The two main differences are:. - PSDE-objects are not triggered by events (not conceptually at least). Rather, the functionality should be implemented in the update() function of the associated script, which is called once per simulation frame. ; - I/Os can be added directly to the object inside the parse() function of the PSDE-object. Linking using the '@'-syntax also works. Therefore, the PSDE-object behaves like any other object that has I/Os (or Data in general). Inside the script these newly defined I/Os can be accessed as members of the object, providing an easy syntax. You can think of the PSDE as a possibility of subclassing the Sofa 'DataEngine' in a scripted way.

Security,"The actual implementation to store parentData is weird because it stores two times the same object. One is in the base class (parentBaseData) and one in its child class; (parentData). . The rational behind the current implementation is that we wanted to access the data without abstraction cost, ie. accessing the object with its true type (eg: Data<T>) instead of its parent type (BaseData) and at the same time having an abstraction to manipulate BaseData. . Duplicating the same obect/point is in general a code smell indicating that something is wrong in the implementation. In general duplication complexify the implementation and error prone (because you have to garantee that the different copies are kept synchronized and interact together in a seamlessness way. . So, in this PR I addresse this duplication problem by removing the lowest type and relying on a dynamic_cast when it is needed. There is an abstraction cost...but it is on a on a very rarerly used method (actually only used for fast copy of data field...and in that context...the cost of the dynamic cast against one of copying millions of Dofs is totally neglectible). . A different pattern was initially used with a child-delegation to expose the abstraction to its parent but it appears it would have made the PR breaking. The difference is that the selected pattern allows one data to be parented to a data of different type while the pattern with child-delegation restrict the parenting to be of exactly the same time. . I personally prefer to have parent only on same type (so that data conversion must be added manually and becomes explicit) but this was not done previously in Sofa and thus breaks some scenes (somes of them are actually really funny....and probably work only by side effect). . ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] ",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490:254,access,access,254,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490,2,['access'],"['access', 'accessing']"

Instead, their equivalent are available as free functions. Indeed, the content did not need to be in a class and `DAGSimulation` did not override them.; - `sofa::simulation::setSimulation` is deprecated. The global variable `Simulation` is set once and for all in the initialization of the `Sofa.Simulation.Graph` module. ⚠️ If `new` is used to provide a new `Simulation`, it results in a memory leak, because `setSimulation` now does nothing. In summary, the type `Simulation` is now only useful to create `Node` instantiations. This feature can be done out of the Simulation class thanks to a refactoring of modules. It will be done later in another PR. Once it is done, the type could be deprecated.

The functions introduced in this pull request allow to apply a function to a range in parallel.; Unit tests are provided.; The newly added functions are used as example in two places:; - GenericConstraintSolver: the code is unique for both sequential and parallel execution; - ParallelHexahedronFEMForceField: no ambiguity: the code is only for parallel execution. But nothing prevent to have a code supporting both sequential and parallel execution. But the component is not totally ready for a merge with HexahedronFEMForceField. Note that it avoids a lot of boilerplate code, hence reducing the complexity of the file. I think this will allow us to write more multithreaded code. In the back, the parallel loop uses a task scheduler and divides the number of elements in `n` ranges, where `n` corresponds to the number of threads in the task scheduler. This is to execute exactly `n` tasks, instead of `m`, if `m` is the number of elements. It avoids the overhead of creating a task for each element. It is more efficient when the number of elements is large. Benchmarks are yet to perform. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"The never-ending quest of eradicating implicit type conversion. This PR contains two things:. 1) Introduction of a user-defined literal for SReal constants.; 2) Avoid implicit conversions. **Introduction of a user-defined literal for SReal constants**. When dealing with constants that should be SReal, I saw the the following behavior in the SOFA code base:. - The `SReal` type is ignored and the constant is considered either as a double or a float, or any other primitive type. Example: `Vector3(1.f, 1.f, 1.f)`, `Vector3(1., 1., 1.)`, or `Vector3(1,1,1)`.; - The constant is C-style cast. Example: `Vector3( (SReal)1, (SReal)1, (SReal)1)`; - The constant is `static_cast`. Example: `Vector3( static_cast<SReal>(1), static_cast<SReal>(1), static_cast<SReal>(1))`. The first option is what we want to avoid. The second option has some problems that the third can solve. However, the third option is ugly, long and can be complex to read. To simplify such expressions, I introduced a user-defined literal. Example: `Vector3(1_sreal, 1_sreal, 1_sreal)`. This PR also fixes some implicit conversions that can be avoided.; ______________________________________________________.

Security,"The usual pattern of component classes is the following:. - A generic method is defined in the base class of the component. Since it is generic, it does not know the type of the `DataTypes` (it's not templated). Instead, it acts on `VecId`.; - In a second base class, inheriting from the first one, the `DataTypes` is known (the class is templated). Therefore, the methods can be defined to work on the right type.; - In this class, the generic method calls the template-specific one. IMO, the template-specific method should not be public. In this PR, they are moved to protected. I think also, that the generic methods can be final, but this is breaking, so I am not sure that it is a good idea to keep the final keyword. The PR starts with the `final` keyword to study the consequence on the CI. Those changes force the user to call only the generic methods. I took the opportunity to add a check on the component state in the generic methods. If the final keyword is used, it would ensure that the component state is called before each call of the public API. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"There were only a few tests on NameDecoder in `SofaKernel/modules/SofaCore/SofaCore_test/objectmodel/BaseClass_test.cpp`. I created a dedicated file to test the main functions in NameDecoder. It required changes in some of the algorithms to comply with the added test:. - Support of nested classes; - Spaces are processed in the first pass of the algorithm, instead of adding a second pass just for spaces. This is also to detect when spaces must be skipped or not (always skipped before). For example, it must not be skipped in `unsigned int`.; - Returned string get a balanced number of opening chevrons and closing chevrons. Note: Anonymous namespaces are not supported (yet?).; Note 2: The algorithms in `NameDecoder` are complicated to read. It is hard to anticipate the result. IMO, it's due to the fact that it is written to be executed in a single pass. I think allowing multiple passes would help to read and debug these functions. `decodeTemplateName` was never called.

Loading these meshes sequentially along time, using a python controller, is equivalent to impose a displacement to the underlying mesh during the simulation.

Security,"This PR aims to handle in a more ""contained"" way the components implemented in different plugins to avoid having everything mixed into the ObjectFactory. . The PR is composed of two aspects. 1) **Registering components by ""plugin.classname"" instead of ""classname"" in the ObjectFactory**. The factory currently access component by their classname only causing collision when two component have the same name/template. To avoid this, the PR add the plugin name as a prefix for the Factory'key. As an exemple, a component created with *<OglModel>* in the past is now referenced as *<SofaOpenglVisual.OglModel>*. Backward compatbility is possible by adding into the factory registration an alias mapping between ; new names and old name;; Eg:; ```; ""OglModel"" => ""SofaOpenglVisual.OglModel""; ```. 2) **Importing plugin and component *à la* python**; A new component called *FromComponent* is added to handle the loading of plugin and the import of object. . Examples of use:; ```; 	 # To make only <OglModel> accessible in the scene; 	<From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""OglModel""/>; 	<OglModel/>. 	# To add ""custom"" name in a scene ; 	<From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""OglModel"" as=""RenderingModel""/>; 	<RenderingModel/>. 	# To be a super lazy man and import everything; 	<From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""*""/>; ```. I didn't implemented multiple object imports so currently it is necessary to do ; ```; <From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""OglModel""/>; <From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""GlslShader""/>; ```; But we could as in python with:; ```; <From plugin=""SofaOpenglVisual"" import=""OglModel, GlslShader""/>; ```. ______________________________________________________.

Since there's not reason to create a separated target for PythonLibs anyway, I removed it, and simply linked PythonLibs as you would do for any other lib. It should not cause any issue to plugins using SofaPython, since PythonLibs' headers / lib are exposed publicly through the SofaPython target anyway. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings.; - [ ] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [ ] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/891:125,expose,expose,125,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/891,2,['expose'],"['expose', 'exposed']"

Security,"This PR shows how to replace sofa::type::Mat with Eigen::Matrix. The goal was to minimize the amount of code change in the code base. Several difficulties arise:; - `sofa::type::Mat` initializes the values, but `Eigen::Matrix` don't; - `sofa::type::Mat` relies on the [] operators from `fixed_array`. I tried to add the [] operators in `Eigen::Matrix`, but too much cases makes it difficult. Maybe not impossible.; - `sofa::type::Vec` must also be a `Eigen::Vector`, but `Eigen::Vector` is a `Eigen::Matrix`, so all the methods we add in `Eigen::Matrix` are also available in `Eigen::Vector`, but sometimes it does not make sense. So conditions must be added on the availability of those methods. Because of those difficulties, the replacement is not simple. This PR is not finished.

Security,"This is a fix for a very specific situation. Here is what happens:. 1. A `msg_warning` is called in a component from a thread different from the main thread. It could be also `msg_error` or `msg_info`, as long as the message count of the element changes. It could be a change of name as well.; 2. The `ObjectStateListener` associated to the component updates the associated `QTreeWidgetItem` (this class is not a `QObject`).; 3. The icon is updated, so it warns the `QTreeWidget` (this class is a QObject) through a signal.; 4. Since the call happens in a thread different from the main thread, the queued connection is used. For that, all signals/slots parameters must be known to Qt's meta-object system. This PR registers the class `QVector<int>`, so it can be used in the queued connection. It partially fixes https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/3610. The warning is no longer triggered by Qt. Therefore, the mutex is locked only once in one thread. I say it solves partially, because any other Qt error would trigger the same crash. ______________________________________________________.

Security,This is an open discussion: ; We have a lot of warning due to 'size_t' to 'unsigned int' / 'int' conversion.; For example: ; ```unsigned int nbdof = this->mstate->getSize();```; or; ``` for (int i=0; i<buffer.size(); ++i) ```. getSize() return a size_t which can be a:; typedef unsigned __int64 size_t; . and not a 32bit unsigned or signed int. So my question is: . Do we really need that sofa::helper::vector getSize return an _int64_ and thus we change to _size_t_ everywhere we access this method?; This means turning a lot of _int_ / _uint_ into _int64_ / _uint64_. Or do we stick to size in _int32_ ; Maybe this has not a big impact in nowadays computer? ; I'm not an expert in software memory optimization. . Or maybe another solution?. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"Warns the user when a non-symmetric matrix is produced by a non-linear mapping while a symmetric linear solver is used. The message looks like:; ```; [ERROR] [RigidMapping(RigidMapping1)] The geometric stiffness of this mapping is a non-symmetric matrix. It means a linear solver supporting non-symmetric matrices must be used, but it is not the case here. To fix your scene, you have two options: 1) Use a linear solver supporting non-symmetric matrices, 2) stabilize the geometric stiffness with the Data 'geometricStiffness' set to 'Stabilized'; ```.

Security,"We got this error many times in the past, and I never had the chance to dig into the issue. There was actually two issues:. 1. SOFA was unable to find some GL extensions on Intel drivers with the Qt viewer while they were supposed to be there (they were correctly found when using the qglviewer); 2. When no extensions at all were found by Glew, SOFA tried to convert a null pointer to a std::string, which created a segmentation fault. This PR fixes both of these issues. It first make sure that the pointer returned by Glew isn't null before converting it to a std::string. It also asks Qt to enable deprecated functions, which are used by SOFA. In addition, I've removed the part of the Qt viewer that was forcing the environment variable `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` on Linux. I've also remove the error when this environment variable wasn't set with Intel driver (which was never the case because we were forcing it...) and added a warning instead (Qt viewer works fine on Intel drivers, maybe this was an old bug?). .

So, instead of writing. ```cpp; template<class T2> struct rebind; {; typedef vector< T2,CPUMemoryManager<T2> > other;; };; ```; I propose to write:; ```cpp; template<class T2>; using rebind_to = vector< T2, CPUMemoryManager<T2> >;; ```. To define `VecTriangleInfo`, we would write:. ```cpp; using VecTriangleInfo = typename VecCoord::template rebind_to<TriangleInfo>;; ```. IMO, it is a bit more readable. But we can do better. I introduced convenience aliases in Rebind.h. With that, I can define `VecTriangleInfo` with:; ```cpp; using VecTriangleInfo = sofa::type::rebind_to<VecCoord, TriangleInfo>;; ```. `sofa::type::rebind_to` works with types having a `rebind_to` typedef (such that the one I introduced in vector_T.h), or on types having one template parameter.

Security,"[ci-depends-on https://github.com/sofa-framework/Regression/pull/56]; [ci-depends-on https://github.com/sofa-framework/BeamAdapter/pull/125]. This PR is based on [PR #56](https://github.com/sofa-framework/Regression/pull/56) of Regression. . This PR fixes the problem of running regression tests in plugins when their references are inside of the plugin and not Regression (e.g. BeamAdapter). The idea is to have a stand alone `*.regression.tests` file that also includes the relative path of the reference folder. This is meant to be placed at the top of the reference file in a relative manne. This allows two things : ; 1. Having a stand alone file ease the process of finding the reference folder for any new comer; 2. Having a stand alone file ease the process of automatizing the retrieval of new regression test along with their reference folder without the need of modifying anything in the CI script. . Tested on my side : only two remaining regression test failing from SofaSPH. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"`SpringForceField` is updated to handle topological changes properly. It now uses callbacks.; A scene example is introduced to test topological changes on a `SpringForceField`. To make the example working, point removal was needed but not implemented. That is why I had to implement `PointSetTopologyModifier::removeItems`, and added the support of points in `TopologicalChangeProcessor`. The use of callbacks fixes the application of the topological changes in `SpringForceField`. Before the use of callbacks, the topological changes were not applied because the force field was not in the same Node than the topology. The new code also supports a change in both input topologies. Previously, changes only in the second topology were possible. Without having testing it, I think the previous code did not handle properly multiple springs connected on a single DoF.

Also there are header files missing which are relevant for using the provided libQGLViewer in external projects/plugins. This is caused by the now modified ```Sofa/GUI/Qt/libQGLViewer/QGLViewer/CMakeLists.txt```:; - The last argument for the ```sofa_create_package_with_targets``` macro adds too many ```/${PROJECT_NAME}``` causing the long install path (line 118); - For some reason the ```sofa_create_package_with_targets``` macro does not copy the ```MOC_HEADER_FILES``` (line 21 ff.). ## Solution:; This PR shortens the output path and copies the contents of ```MOC_HEADER_FILES``` to the ""normal"" ```HEADER_FILES``` which causes them to be copied to the install/include directory. This does not affect the build but ensures that all headers are copied. This was tested on Windows and two different Linux installations.

Security,"a broad phase, but the code is located in its base class: `BruteForceBroadPhase`.; The narrow phase code has been extracted and put in a new component: `DirectSAPNarrowPhase`. `DirectSAP` inherits from `DirectSAPNarrowPhase`.; In the narrow phase, the result of the broad phase is used to skip the boxes which have been totally ignored in the broad phase. Initially, the `DirectSAP` component did not perform any discrimination in its broad phase. Now it performs a `BruteForceBroadPhase`. It is not yet clear if it is always a good choice regarding the performances. In the case of the caduceus scene, the performances are slightly better. I guess if the broad phase takes a lot of time (many objects), it is better to avoid it. `DirectSAP` would not be the best choice. I would use a more performant broad phase, or no broad phase, when used with `DirectSAPNarrowPhase`. From now, the user can decide to design its scene with two different ways resulting to the same behavior:; ```; <DirectSAP/>; ```; or; ```; <BruteForceBroadPhase/>; <DirectSAPNarrowPhase/>; ```; In the second option, it will be possible to change the combination of broad phase/narrow phase.; Note: I kept the component `DirectSAP`, but I don't think its name is meaningful.

Security,"and _bwd_* functions, because of the boilerplate code. In a nutshell, there are race conditions which can be avoided if the derived class can execute only the code they are designed to execute, and nothing more. ### Proposition. I added boolean variables named `applyFwd*` and `applyBwd*`, each corresponding to the `fwd*` and `bwd*` functions. They are all set to false by default.; For example, if `applyFwdMechanicalState` is true, then the code related to `fwdMechanicalState` is executed. Remember that previously, the boilerplate code related to `fwdMechanicalState` was executed even if `fwdMechanicalState` does nothing. To change that, the derived class must set the right variables to true, so the right code is executed. For example, if a derived class wants to execute `fwdMechanicalState`, it must set `applyFwdMechanicalState` first, usually in its constructor. ### Pros. - Avoid unnecessary race conditions; - Does not execute unnecessary boilerplate code; - Simple to understand. ### Cons. - Breaks all classes derived from `BaseMechanicalVisitor`; - Forces the developers of classes derived from `BaseMechanicalVisitor` to tune booleans according the goal of the visitor.; - Runtime check of the variables.

In WarpPreconditioner, an additional Data is introduced to request matrix assembly at a given frequency. This is to minimize the cost of matrix assembly. Instead of assembling the matrix, the old one is used, taking into account the rotations compared to the previous time step. The same mechanism exists in ShewchukPCGLinearSolver.

Security,"e anything. It's time for refactoring!. My focus was the refactoring of the unit tests. Before the PR, a unique class tested the 3 components using a series of `if`. I refactored the 3 classes in order to reduce the specific processing in the unit test, i.e. reduce the number of `if`. - The 3 classes now inherit from a common base class `BaseLinearElasticityFEMForceField`. I moved everything that was common (only regarding the unit test. More common code is remaining) in this class. It includes:; - A common `Data` for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. This way, they share type, the same default value, and the same description. Note that Young's modulus in `FastTetrahedralCorotationalForceField` and `TetrahedralCorotationalFEMForceField` was a scalar, and now it's a vector of scalars. This requires to add a common way to access the Young's modulus of the i-th element. This is also a breaking change. This allows to define a typed unit test for all 3 classes. The particularities of the classes are defined in a derived class of the unit test. To me, a great advantage, is that we identify clearly that there are unit tests for the 3 components, because there a file for each class. It was not obvious before.

This is because the simulation is no longer deterministic (because of #2047). . Conclusion: #2047 revealed this crash, but was not the cause. It means that a non-deterministic simulation is not a source of crash. ## Fix; The crash is fixed also by updating the values of the map, similarly to the freeze fix. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"ents having access to 2 mechanical states inherit from `PairStateAccessor`. It is templated on `DataTypes1` and `DataTypes2`, with a link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes1>` and a second link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes2>`.; - Components inheriting from `SingleStateAccessor` or `PairStateAccessor` fill the dynamic list contained in the `StateAccessor` implementation.; - It does not break the previous accesses, variable names etc. The goal is that all the components accessing a `BaseMechanicalState` can provide a list of them in a generic way. For example, `BaseInteractionForceField` supposed only 2 mechanical states. Since it inherits now from `StateAccessor`, it can have links to more than 2 (note that none of the interaction force field I found work with more than 2). Another example: `BaseForceField` did not have any reference to a mechanical state, but all the force fields inherits from `ForceField` which has a link to a mechanical state. Therefore, we couldn't have access to a mechanical state from a `BaseForceField`. I also cleaned the files:; - Concatenate nested namespaces; - Use `#pragma once`; - Some private and non-defined copy constructors and `operator=` are marked `delete`.; - Move methods in cpp; - Removed unnecessary `init()` implementations.

Security,"ers. . In this PR I implemented a mecanism to do that. ; The basic idea is to have in scene a component that specify for which version of Sofa the scene have been tested. Here is how it looks in the scene:; ```xml; <APIVersion level='17.06'/>; ```; If the scene does not have this component the level is automatically set to 17.06 so existing scene will just work as they should. Now what happens if a scene with a given level is loaded in a sofa that have a different level (eg: '17.12'). In this case dedicated messages are printed to warn user things may go wrong. . Here is an example of what happen when loading a scene at level '17.06' on runSofa at level '17.12' (our master branch) with a BoxStiffSpringForceField (that could behave differently because of PR #290); ```; [INFO] [SceneChecker] The 'APIVersion' directive is missing in the current scene. ; Switching to the APIVersion level '17.06' ; [INFO] [SceneChecker] Validating a scene: ; - APIVersion checking: 1 ; - RequiredPlugin checking: 1; [WARNING] [BoxStiffSpringForceField(Spring)] BoxStiffSpringForceField have changed since 17.06. To use the old behavior you need to set parameter 'forceOldBehavior=true'; ```. The nice thing with the approach is that we can write custom condition to rise those messages. Here is a simple example (to handle PR315 & an imaginary deprecation of a component):; ```cpp; addHookInChangeSet(""17.06"", [](Base* o){; if(o->getClassName() == ""RestShapeSpringsForceField"" && o->findData(""external_rest_shape"")->isSet()); msg_warning(o) << ""RestShapeSpringsForceField have changed since 17.06.

Security,"ery Data that we manipulate in sofa can return type informations. ; This can be done in two ways:; - the first solution rely on type_traits with the specialization of the DataTypeInfo class. A DefaultDataTypeInfo is provided as a fallback scenario while fully defined information can be provided by providing a specialization for DataTypeInfo<>. ; - the second solution is a runtime approach were the typeinfo is inherited from AbstractTypeInfo. ; To *ease* the implementation the runtime solution is generated by ""reusing"" the static one. This is done with VirtualTypeInfo<StaticDataTypeInfo>. This VirtualTypeInfo inherits from AbstractTypeInfo but wrap and forward all the method call to the StaticDataTypeInfo passed in the template parameter. . This is actually an interesting design gears provided fast/efficient API and an abstract one with lower performance. Nevertheless there is actually one problem with the existing implementation, the problem is that by default access to the static version (so the one that need the full inclusion of involved data types) to generate the dynamic one in the VirtualTypeInfo::get() method. As this function is needed to implement Data<T>::getAbstractTypeInfo it means that the complete static version is needed everytime and everywhere we manipulate a Data<>. To be sure the code does not fall back to DefaultTypeInfo... most of the specilization are made visible in DataTypeInfo.h where a lot of data types ""vector, rigid, map, vec, quat"". All these includes are just there to insure that in Sofa no-one will never fallback on the default dehavior. But static type info is kind of ""expert"" feature that is only usefull in few rare use cases. So polluting the complete dependency tree (and compilation unit) for a rarely use case is problematic. . So I tried to reverse all to implement an opt-in solution ... by default and for most of our code base, dynamic typeinfo (aka the one following the AbstractTypeInfo interface) are available because they only",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1552:1153,access,access,1153,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1552,1,['access'],['access']

While here, this also setup some CI for this packaging, mostly to detect early:; - if anything new in the repo would break the nix packaging; - if any update from a dependency in upstream [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) would break sofa. But also, a nix binary cache can be set up with eg. https://www.cachix.org/, so that once a commit is build in CI, users & developers can directly use that cache instead of compiling themselves.; (it is also true in the other way: developers with write access to the cache can send their build result to it so that the CI will be instantaneous cache hit).

This GUI is launchable with the standard runSofa (with the parameter ""-g glfw""), or can be used with a (provided) stand-alone executable (which needs much less dependencies than runSofa). Lastly, this GUI was designed to support multiple windows in the same time and multiple simulations. So when multiple simulations is possible is the future, it should be easy to modify the code to support this feature.; And multiple windows could be based on the fact having multiple Camera in the scene (feature not implemented yet). ______________________________________________________.

Security,"lementation is that we wanted to access the data without abstraction cost, ie. accessing the object with its true type (eg: Data<T>) instead of its parent type (BaseData) and at the same time having an abstraction to manipulate BaseData. . Duplicating the same obect/point is in general a code smell indicating that something is wrong in the implementation. In general duplication complexify the implementation and error prone (because you have to garantee that the different copies are kept synchronized and interact together in a seamlessness way. . So, in this PR I addresse this duplication problem by removing the lowest type and relying on a dynamic_cast when it is needed. There is an abstraction cost...but it is on a on a very rarerly used method (actually only used for fast copy of data field...and in that context...the cost of the dynamic cast against one of copying millions of Dofs is totally neglectible). . A different pattern was initially used with a child-delegation to expose the abstraction to its parent but it appears it would have made the PR breaking. The difference is that the selected pattern allows one data to be parented to a data of different type while the pattern with child-delegation restrict the parenting to be of exactly the same time. . I personally prefer to have parent only on same type (so that data conversion must be added manually and becomes explicit) but this was not done previously in Sofa and thus breaks some scenes (somes of them are actually really funny....and probably work only by side effect). . ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [x] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [x] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only i",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490:1211,expose,expose,1211,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1490,1,['expose'],['expose']

It's time for refactoring!. My focus was the refactoring of the unit tests. Before the PR, a unique class tested the 3 components using a series of `if`. I refactored the 3 classes in order to reduce the specific processing in the unit test, i.e. reduce the number of `if`. - The 3 classes now inherit from a common base class `BaseLinearElasticityFEMForceField`. I moved everything that was common (only regarding the unit test. More common code is remaining) in this class. It includes:; - A common `Data` for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. This way, they share type, the same default value, and the same description. Note that Young's modulus in `FastTetrahedralCorotationalForceField` and `TetrahedralCorotationalFEMForceField` was a scalar, and now it's a vector of scalars. This requires to add a common way to access the Young's modulus of the i-th element. This is also a breaking change. This allows to define a typed unit test for all 3 classes. The particularities of the classes are defined in a derived class of the unit test. To me, a great advantage, is that we identify clearly that there are unit tests for the 3 components, because there a file for each class. It was not obvious before.

Example scene which show triangle refining.; Creation of Binding_BaseTopologyObject common to PointSetTopologyModifier and TriangleSetTopologyModifier.; Add a getObjects() method to python BaseContext interface. Allow selection of objects based on type and name.

Moreover the search direction can now optionally be passed to BaseContext_getObjects() (default is 'Local').; Binding_Data expose fullPath read only parameter for BaseData that derive from DataFileName, which as the name suggests, returns the fullPath to the file pointed by that data. Returns None otherwise. ### Bugfixes; If the data to be gotten using the bind is a vector of type 'unknown' then the text of the data is returned as a whole.; Fix compilation and warnings with gcc.; Fix SofaPython build on linux.; Fix undefined behaviour and potential crash in Python BaseContext.getObjects() due to PyList accessed out of bounds. ; Fix a memory leak which happens whenever an object is transferred from C++ to Python. _______________________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings nor unit test failures.; - [x] does not break existing scenes.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [x] has been reviewed and agreed to be transitional.; - [x] is more than 1 week old. **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/171:1653,access,accessed,1653,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/171,1,['access'],['accessed']

Security,"ompile-time, and it is not possible to use runtime polymorphism. Therefore, it was not possible to uncouple the solver itself from the ordering method. To comply with the new design, I introduced a factory that can be enriched in the new Metis plugin. This factory is able to register types and use runtime polymorphism using a few C++ tricks. The only concern is that the solvers in the factory will not use the algorithms from the `BaseOrderingMethod`. Instead, they use a simple string (defined in a `BaseOrderingMethod`), and its mapping to a type. This has to be registered in the initialization of the module. I tried hard to use the intelligence of the component instead of relying on a string and a factory, but the design of Eigen is not compatible. In order to not force the users to add an ordering method in their scenes, a default one is created automatically by the linear solver. It instantiates `MetisOrderingMethod` if it can find it, otherwise it's `AMDOrderingMethod`. Here are the tasks in a future PR:. 1. Create a plugin for Metis; 2. Move `MetisOrderingMethod` into this plugin; 3. Move some unit tests in this plugin; 4. Update the regression references; 5. Update `FillReducingOrdering`; 6. Remove METIS dependency in `LinearSolver.Direct`; 7. Create a new plugin for Scotch. ______________________________________________________.

So I tried to reverse all to implement an opt-in solution ... by default and for most of our code base, dynamic typeinfo (aka the one following the AbstractTypeInfo interface) are available because they only requires opaque data types.

Bying abstract by default ...make that the dependencies is reduced a lot. . This PR:; - add DataTypeId<xxxx> so we can have an unique id per data type. This unique id is statically allocated and is used a way to access the DataTypeInfoRegistry in an efficiant way. ; - add a unique storage repository (DataTypeInfoRegistry). This storage is holding all the typeinfo use in Sofa. There is two way ; to be registered in the repository, the first one consist consist in explcitly adding a typeinfo instance in the storage. This is what to do when we want to be sure the fully defined data type is registered. ; - the other was implemented to mimick at best the the existing behavior in Sofa while fixing some of its error. It works the following way... when a Data<Type> is used this automatically trigs the setting of the typeinfo in the repository.

To cut into the dependency tree I introduce opaque function for the most commonly used in .h; The choosen convention was to use a namespace that is symetric to the class name. ; So the opaque version of ```sofa::core::BaseContext::getDt()``` is ```sofa::core::objectmodel::basecontext::getDt(BaseContext*);``` . For the moment, all the opaque function are added in the per namespace fwd.h.; The following ones has been introduced.; In sofa/simulation/fwd.h; ```cpp; Node* sofa::simulation::node::getNodeFrom(BaseContext*);; Node* sofa::simulation::node::getNodeFrom(Base*);; Base* sofa::simulation::node::toBase(Node*);; BaseContext* sofa::simulation::node::toBaseContext(Node*);; ```. In sofa/core/fwd.h; ```; sofa::core::objectmodel::basecontext::getDt(BaseContext*); ; sofa::core::objectmodel::basecontext::getTime(BaseContext*); ; ```. NB: it is possible if the use of these opaque function generalize to move the definition of these ones into more narrow file eg:; sofa/core/objectmodel/node-c-api.h.

Example scene which show triangle refining.; Creation of Binding_BaseTopologyObject common to PointSetTopologyModifier and TriangleSetTopologyModifier.; Add a getObjects() method to python BaseContext interface. Allow selection of objects based on type and name. May be extended to include more search options later. ### Improvements; SendScriptEvent should only be applied on a specified node, not on root !; WARNING: may affect python script behavior.; Allow to get the value of a data as a string when its type is not handle by the binding.; Object and type names are now both optional when calling BaseContext_getObjects(). Moreover the search direction can now optionally be passed to BaseContext_getObjects() (default is 'Local').; Binding_Data expose fullPath read only parameter for BaseData that derive from DataFileName, which as the name suggests, returns the fullPath to the file pointed by that data. Returns None otherwise. ### Bugfixes; If the data to be gotten using the bind is a vector of type 'unknown' then the text of the data is returned as a whole.; Fix compilation and warnings with gcc.; Fix SofaPython build on linux.; Fix undefined behaviour and potential crash in Python BaseContext.getObjects() due to PyList accessed out of bounds. ; Fix a memory leak which happens whenever an object is transferred from C++ to Python. _______________________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings nor unit test failures.; - [x] does not break existing scenes.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [x] has been reviewed and agreed to be transitional.; - [x] is more than 1 week old. **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.*",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/171:1166,expose,expose,1166,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/171,1,['expose'],['expose']

Security,"sing one or more mechanical states, in order to access state variables, such as position, force etc. They all manage their own way to store, find and manage their link to one or more mechanical states. Instead, I suggest to factorize this access using intermediate classes. It comes with the following features:. - All components inherit from `StateAccessor`, which contains a dynamic list of `BaseMechanicalState`; - Components having access to only one mechanical state inherit from `SingleStateAccessor`. It is templated on `DataTypes`, with a link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes>`.; - Components having access to 2 mechanical states inherit from `PairStateAccessor`. It is templated on `DataTypes1` and `DataTypes2`, with a link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes1>` and a second link to a `MechanicalState<DataTypes2>`.; - Components inheriting from `SingleStateAccessor` or `PairStateAccessor` fill the dynamic list contained in the `StateAccessor` implementation.; - It does not break the previous accesses, variable names etc. The goal is that all the components accessing a `BaseMechanicalState` can provide a list of them in a generic way. For example, `BaseInteractionForceField` supposed only 2 mechanical states. Since it inherits now from `StateAccessor`, it can have links to more than 2 (note that none of the interaction force field I found work with more than 2). Another example: `BaseForceField` did not have any reference to a mechanical state, but all the force fields inherits from `ForceField` which has a link to a mechanical state. Therefore, we couldn't have access to a mechanical state from a `BaseForceField`. I also cleaned the files:; - Concatenate nested namespaces; - Use `#pragma once`; - Some private and non-defined copy constructors and `operator=` are marked `delete`.; - Move methods in cpp; - Removed unnecessary `init()` implementations. They only called their base class `init()`.; - `Constraint ` has a link to the mechanical state instead of a raw pointer.;",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2438:1063,access,accesses,1063,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2438,1,['access'],['accesses']

Security,"ted with each of the mapping parent dofs. - ContactMappers : It is (very) questionable to let contact mappers propagate the unconstrained dynamics solution vector towards contact dofs by calling `updateXfree()` since it will induce inconsistencies in mapping linearisation if the contact mappers are non linear, since contact mappings will therefore be linearised around the free motion configuration, and the rest being linearised around the configuration at the beginning of the time step. This PR does not address this problem which is left for future work. It arises only with non linear contact mappers (like the `RigidContactMapper` for instance), but this should be kept in mind. - LinearSolver API : As a general note, I believe the LinearSolver API is a bloated with virtual methods which are difficult to understand since they are not directly related to the computation / factorisation of a positive definite matrix, and are mostly optional especially for non assembled solver like CG. Most of the methods should reside in the ConstraintCorrection API, and concrete instance of ConstraintCorrection should be templated on the type of LinearSolver in my opinion, since it is the only objects that actually make use of these methods, and really what you want is to have access to the concrete type of Matrix and Vector used by the solver. Also from my understanding only `LinearSolver` instances that derive from `MatrixLinearSolver` implement these kind of methods, so maybe a first step would be to move them here. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings.; - [ ] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [ ] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/459:8311,access,access,8311,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/459,1,['access'],['access']

If TopologyHandler has well been added to the list manged by the Container, a internal bool m_isRegisterd is set to true.; 3. When the TopologyHandler is deleted (meaning its component owner is deleted). If m_isRegisterd == true, the TopologyHandler will unregister itself.; 4. When the TopologyContainer is deleted, it will go through each TopologyHandler it is managing and turn m_isRegisted to false. And then clear the list without deleting the Handler. The bool m_isRegisterd is used because to unregister itself, the handler need to access the topologyContainer which could have already been destroyed (depending on the graph order). But the TopologyHandler doesn't now the container is null. That's why if the TopologyContainer is deleted first it sets all its topologyHander as unregistered. ### Linked issues; Based on PR #3271 ; Fixes #3370 #3202. ______________________________________________________.

Security,"ting from `BruteForceBroadPhase` instead of `BroadPhaseDetection`. This is what I did in `RayTraceDetection`. Doing that, I could remove all the broad phase code from `RayTraceDetection`. # What comes next. It is also my intention to inherit from `BruteForceBroadPhase` in `BruteForceDetection`, and remove all the broad phase code from `BruteForceDetection`. The broad phase code from `BruteForceDetection` and `RayTraceDetection` would be shared from `BruteForceBroadPhase`. However, I expect complex conflicts because of #1999. I'll do that if #1999 is accepted and merged. It is also my intention to extract the narrow phase from `BruteForceDetection` and put it in another component which would inherit from `NarrowPhaseDetection`. The narrow phase in `BruteForceDetection` is not brute force, and should be named with a clearer and more meaningful name. It will be the case with the new component. I also believe SAP can be implemented as a broad phase only component. We would have the choice between `BruteForceBroadPhase` and `SAPBroadPhase`. Any narrow phase would work with both broad phases (`BruteForceBroadPhase` and `SAPBroadPhase`). Finally, with all those changes, we can consider more modularity on the collision detection and choose any combination of broad phase and narrow phase. ______________________________________________________.

For example, setting an absolute displacement norm of 1e-5 might seem enough for a liver mesh set in millimetres, but is definitely not adequate for the same liver using this time a mesh scaled in metres. This is a source of user error, and is probably why many FEM software will use relative convergence criteria. The two additional criteria are:. 1. The relative residual norm |R|/|R0| where |R| is the norm of the force vector after the last Newton iteration, and |R0| is the norm of the force vector after the first Newton iteration.; 2. The relative displacement norm |dx|/|U| where |dx| is the norm of the latest solution vector, and |U| is the norm of the sum over all previous solution vectors of the current time step. To remove any confusion between absolute and relative criteria, the convergence data field ""correction_tolerance_threshold"" and ""residual_tolerance_threshold"" were renamed for ""absolute_correction_tolerance_threshold"" and ""absolute_residual_tolerance_threshold"", respectively. Note that to keep a compatibility layer with older scene files, these old data field names are still available, but a deprecated warning is shown to the user, inviting him to update its scene.

So I set the partial solving API in an interface (crudely called PartialLinearSolver, name can be gladly changed), and is implemented only by BTDLinearSolver.; As for LinearSolverConstraintCorrection, it will check at construction if the given linearsolver is able to handle partialsolving (by dynamic_cast sadly) and if not, can warn the user that the linear solver is not usable and will be in ""incorrect"" state afterwards, instead of printing ""partial_solve not implemented"" while simulating.... A nice side-effect is that linear solvers libs will be slightly smaller, as all instanciations of all linear solvers (except btd then) do not contain init_partial_solve() and partial_solve() functions anymore. EDIT: it is even worse, linear solvers not implementing partial_solve does a ""msg_info()"" so w/o printLog off, users wont even know why the ConstraintSolver/ConstraintCorrections is not doing its job....; See unit tests on LCPForceFieldback, it is using SparseLDLSolver (not implementing partial_solve) and the tests do not throw any warning, even if it is using LCPConstraintSolver and LinearSolverConstraintCorrection. ______________________________________________________.

Testability," #1527. ## What; SofaHelper, SofaDefaulttype, SofaCore and SofaSimulationCore does not respect the new naming convention (following namespace, etc). So this PR renames those 4 modules:; - SofaHelper ▶ Sofa.Helper; - SofaDefaulttype ▶ Sofa.Defaulttype; - SofaCore ▶ Sofa.Core; - SofaSimulationCore ▶ Sofa.SimulationCore (this one will need more work for the namespaces etc). This PR does not rename physically the folders, I preferred split the renaming in two steps (and have a less chaotic git history). ## Breaking?; Nope, thanks to the Alias system in CMake (I would have not bet on that at the beginning 😗); I could compile SofaPy3 out-of-tree without changing anything. I added some compatibility for the previous cmake macro/variables in the config.h (e.g SOFAHELPER_HAVE_BOOST instead of the new variable SOFA_HELPER_HAVE_BOOST).; These variables are not used at all in the code base of SOFA but some users might use them in their external plugins?. Actually, it could break projects using directly SofaHelper(&co) directly, i.e not handling CMake target but library names directly. (but people should not do that 🤥). Tested with an out-of-tree build of SofaPy3. ## After; Once everything is done, and once things are calming down in the SofaFramework, the folders themselves can be renamed. . ______________________________________________________.

Testability," - Minor cleaning such as namespace concatenation, ... # Fix absence of collision response with stationary object; The contact with stationary objects are supposed to be handled by the collision pipeline before creating groups with the group manager.

Actually, the collision pipeline check if an object is stationary based on the value of `isSimulated()`. It means it's up to the user to set this Data. If it not done, the object is considered moving and goes to the group manager.

It is undeniable that `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` are faster than `sofa::helper::map_ptr_stable_compare`. However, I don't know how crucial it is to have this kind of map with a dedicated comparator. Is this feature necessary? If not, I am in favour of using `std::unordered_map` wherever `sofa::helper::map_ptr_stable_compare` is used, for performances reasons. Overall, we won't get a huge gain of fps, but still it has an impact on the peformances of `NarrowPhaseDetection`. Initially, I wondered why `NarrowPhaseDetection` took so much time for so simple instructions. ______________________________________________________.

CompressedRowSparseMatrixMat3x3d is faster because it manipulates blocks of 3x3, which is the best strategy in this case. Unfortunately, Eigen manipulates scalars only.; To be fair, EigenSparseMatrixd must be compared to CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. We notice a slight speed up with EigenSparseMatrixd . I wanted to use Eigen::BlockSparseMatrix to have blocks of 3x3, but as an unsupported module, it does not compile with Eigen 3.4. I increased the resolution of the grid: MBKBuild becomes slower than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd, and MBKSolve stays faster than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. Due to the slow down in MBKBuild, EigenSparseMatrixd is not very interesting in this example. I'll continue my investigations on the use of these wrappers. ______________________________________________________.

The speed up is quite disappointing. But the benchmarks explain it. The speed up depends on the size of the matrix, the sparsity and overall on the size of the intersection.; Yet, there is a speedup. And compared to the reference timings before the series of optimizations (https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2362), `MechanicalMatrixMapper` is about twice faster (in the example). Some notes:. - I added a skeleton to also support product of `CompressedRowSparseMatrix`, but it is not implemented yet. In `MechanicalMatrixMapper`, a `CompressedRowSparseMatrix` is converted to Eigen to do the product. It is not clear yet if the copy to Eigen is required if we are able to perform the fast product on a `CompressedRowSparseMatrix`. So, an implementation of the fast product of `CompressedRowSparseMatrix` may be introduced in the future. Otherwise, I'll remove the files.; - This work has been started by @Esther-R during her internship; - Contrary to the regular product, the product using the intersection can be parallelized for more speed up.; - More speed up in `MechanicalMatrixMapper` using multithreading can be considered. ______________________________________________________.

Testability," CompressedRowSparseMatrix . I renamed all the **bloc** words to **block** as well. The previous CRSMatrix could be used as a BaseMatrix (solvers), ConstraintMatrix (iterations) and as a pure CRS itself.; This new CRSMatrix is decomposed in several types:; - CRSGeneric (name to be changed maybe): the pure CRS structure; - CRSMechanical: inheriting/implementing BaseMatrix; - (in a next PR) CRSConstraintMatrix, with the same API as the old CRSMatrix used for ConstraintMatrices (for iterating). Different purposes need different traits (some case would prefer autocompression, etc), so a lot of compile-time options are present. They are called policy.; I needed to change some flags from the Insimo's version to have the same behavior for the tests. So in the future, it could be interesting to see if those changes should be integrated later for more performance (but the tests would need to be changed). For compatibility reasons, the old ""CRSMatrix"" type is an alias on CRSMechanical. In this PR, no change of performance is noted (neither regression or upgrade).

Testability," Now, `x`, `y`, `z` and `w` are compiled conditionally. Other methods, such as `Identity`, `transpose` etc, are also concerned for squared matrices. The `static_assert` are therefore no longer useful. . `Identity` has been changed so it is `static constexpr` and it returns a reference. So there is no need to compute the identity matrix each time it is called. `s_identity` is now deprecated. The static variable is now included in the `Identity` method. It is better for static initialization fiasco and required for a `constexpr` context. Also, `s_identity` does not make sense for rectangular matrices. Since it is not possible to conditionally add a class member, it is hidden in the conditionally compiled method `Identity`. In `fixed_array`, the `operator<` is moved out of the class. This allows to compile this operator only when used, and not in explicit instantiations. This is necessary because the operator on `fixed_array<Vec3>` is not implemented (and does not make sense). The 3x3 matrix product and the `multTranspose` operation are specialized for a speedup. https://github.com/alxbilger/SofaBenchmark was used. Results show that this implementation is closer to the Eigen implementation. Unit tests are added.

Testability," an existing ""Intersection"", e.g MinProximityIntersection and MeshMinProximityIntersection, which add triangles, etc methods to MinProximityIntersection. Note that even if it is called ""Intersection"" it is not a ""Intersection"" 🤪; There is kind of mechanism with a IntersectorCreator/IntersectorFactory which does the ""plugin"" automatically.; The problem is that the intersector gets a pointer to its intersection at the load-time (when the dll is loaded).; The intersector needs the intersection to get alarm/contact distance (defined for all Intersection) or custom parameters (useSurfaceNormal for MinProximityIntersection). **Consequence:** if there are multiple simulation (in multiple thread) in the same time, a different thread will get a pointer to an other Intersection while doing its intersect code. In the end, this PR modifies all the intersect/canIntersect functions to get the intersection method (as if they were static functions in reality) and avoid race conditions. The pipeline needs also to be modified.

Testability," everywhere in the core, and it is difficult to bypass it if you dont need it (typically for batch mode or headless system).; The macro **SOFA_NO_OPENGL** is a really Quick and Dirty solution to this problem.; For example, people include sofa/helper/system/gl.h (or any gl-related header), even without needing OpenGL actually. ; And in this header, **SOFA_NO_OPENGL** does include (or not) the good gl.h header according to your OS.

Testability," have similarities (even duplicated code), but don't share anything. It's time for refactoring!. My focus was the refactoring of the unit tests. Before the PR, a unique class tested the 3 components using a series of `if`. I refactored the 3 classes in order to reduce the specific processing in the unit test, i.e. reduce the number of `if`. - The 3 classes now inherit from a common base class `BaseLinearElasticityFEMForceField`. I moved everything that was common (only regarding the unit test. More common code is remaining) in this class. It includes:; - A common `Data` for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. This way, they share type, the same default value, and the same description. Note that Young's modulus in `FastTetrahedralCorotationalForceField` and `TetrahedralCorotationalFEMForceField` was a scalar, and now it's a vector of scalars. This requires to add a common way to access the Young's modulus of the i-th element. This is also a breaking change. This allows to define a typed unit test for all 3 classes. The particularities of the classes are defined in a derived class of the unit test. To me, a great advantage, is that we identify clearly that there are unit tests for the 3 components, because there a file for each class. It was not obvious before.

Testability," implicitly keep track of all the operations thanks to the newly introduced scalar types.; 2. Because of the new method, `SparseMatrixStorageOrder` is no longer useful. It can be removed later; 3. Unit tests are extensive. They test all possible configuration of storage of LHS, RHS and Result. They are required because a condition on the storage type is required to swap the indices after the matrix product.; 4. A parallel version of the algorithm is introduced; 5. Benchmarks: https://github.com/alxbilger/SofaBenchmark/pull/39. Analysis of the results of the benchmarks:; - The best configuration storage for the fast matrix product seems to be ColColCol; - The fast matrix product is always faster than the regular product, except for a matrix of size 1000 and sparsity of 15%. This probably indicates that the method is adapted for very sparse matrices; - The parallel fast matrix product algorithm is always faster than the sequential algorithm, except for very small matrices where the overhead of parallelism is not negligible. However, the speed up is not linear with the number of cores and can be disappointing.; - The parallel fast matrix product is always faster than the regular product even for the matrix of size 1000 and sparsity of 15%, but not for very small matrices (overhead). ______________________________________________________.

Testability," on templates without any knowledge of the inner layout of the template type. I'm not 100% sure that I found all instances of those calls in Sofa's core, but it seems like it is *exclusively* used with TDataType::Coord and TDataType::Deriv (which are either VecX or RigidCoord/RigidDeriv). In conclusion the usage of DataTypeInfo in BaseData justifies its existence to me. Maybe some features could be isolated in a separate API, but that would only mean maintaining 2 APIs instead of one. I think that instead of trying to remove it from SOFA, we should investigate how to make the API better:; 1. size() / byteSize() / size(void* data) are really unclear (hence the shitty doc on those methods I guess, and it is really hard to know which of these methods serves what purpose. If we base ourselves on the terminology of another data abstraction tool (say numpy), we will still not be able to easily cover complex data types such as sparse matrices easily, but we at least will have a way clearer API to dig into: len, size, shape, ndim...; 2. just like SimpleLayout, we could add a dedicated flag for specific types, to simplify conversions in bindings (Keep the Container flag but maybe add additional ""Matrix"", ""Vector"", and ""Complex"" flags to further discriminate, maybe a SparseMatrix too...; 3. We could add extra pre-filled specializations of DataTypeInfo with clear names to simplify writing new ones (so that we don't have to fill up every flags ourselves everytime); 3. @jnbrunet @damienmarchal what do you think?. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings.; - [ ] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [ ] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1385:4050,test,test,4050,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1385,2,['test'],['test']

Testability," rely on SingleLink. . It is questionnable if the iterable list of typed sofa object should be stored in link instead of a a much simpler container. They are not using any of specific feature of SingleLink (like path read/writing which is actually invalid behavior as the content of the container is fully defined by the node and cannot be filled with user specified component). . At that time the sole puprose of using SingleLink seems to able to expose the content of these container in the GUI. If this is the case a much simpler code architecture should be used to avoid bloating the Node.h and API. In this PR we replace the Node::Single by the combination of two objects:; - NodeContainerSingle which only handle the ""container"" specific part of the SingleLink; - LinkeableContainer which wrap a container to expose it as a BaseLink. . The advantage of this design is twofold:; - only NodeContainerSingle is needed in Node.h and has a much reduce code-generation compared to SingleLink. ; - NodeContainerSingle can operate with forward declaration (which is not the case of SingleLink which helps to keep clean the inclusion tree.; - there is a clear separation between the Container and the Link part which lead to a very readable code.

Testability," the calls of `debug_write_state_before` and `debug_write_state_after`, instead of the functions themselves. Doing that, it allows to actually compile the debug content of both function. And I noticed that they had compilation errors (we could not detect it as SOFA_VERBOSE_TRAVERSAL is never defined). My concerns:. 1. I wanted to use `Visitor::runVisitorTask` in other visitors than BaseMechanicalVisitor. But the logic is not the same. BaseMechanialVisitor is the only visitor checking the tags. Should we always check the tags? Also, the debug boilerplate code is not consistent over all the visitors.; 2. `Visitor::for_each` returns only the result of the last call in the loop. In another loop on the solvers at the beginning of `BaseMechanicalVisitor::processNodeTopDown`, we check the intermediate values. It is not consistent. I suspect that `Visitor::for_each` must also check intermediate values.; 3. In `BaseMechanicalVisitor::processNodeTopDown`, between the process of `mechanicalMapping` and `mechanicalState`, we don't check if `res == RESULT_PRUNE`. It means we do the process of `mechanicalState` even if the process of `mechanicalMapping` returned `RESULT_PRUNE`. It's not consistent with the rest of the code.; 4. It is not possible to define SOFA_VERBOSE_TRAVERSAL through cmake. ______________________________________________________.

Testability," the component; - **reinit pythonBinding / the Qt GUI's ModifyObject** calls reinit, and that call is wrapped the same MessageHandling mechanism to set or unset the Valid / Invalid flag. _**LIMITATIONS**_; There is a weak link in this approach:; reinit() will NOT unset the Invalid flag from a component if it is called from elsewhere than the GUI's ModifyObject api. This can happen often: when calling reinit from a c++ program that doesn't use runSofa's GUI for instance.; In order to guarantee that the state is set properly on reinit(), reinit should be a delegate method nested in a method performing the check on the msg_error, and setting the Valid / Invalid flag appropriately. This would be a **VERY** breaking, and time consuming task. calling the state updating mechanisms from the python bindings, visitors & GUI is kind of QuickNDirty but should reveal all components that aren't implementing properly their init / reinit / bwdInit methods properly, and show at the component level a hint at how often components stay in a ""Dirty' state. TODO: ; - Create a StateCheckerVisitor and run it at the end of the DefaultAnimationLoop's step function; - Use the StateCheckerVisitor to either ; - show a warning message if a component is in an Invalid / Unspecified state; - run init() / reinit() on the components whose states are invalid or unspecified; - display a warning icon in runSofa's Scene graph to reflect the component's state. @damienmarchal do you see a non-intrusive solution to the reinit() problem...? ; ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings.; - [ ] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [ ] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/823:3349,test,test,3349,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/823,2,['test'],['test']
Testability," the old symbol, which is strange and certainly made the compat layer break is used because often the two types where completely unrelated but `setParent` isn't templated so.... ; 2. This compat layer only works for `Data<T>` every types that inherits from it, will only see the original `Data<T>` methods taken into account in the compact layer. This was the case here for `DataFileName` and all `TopologicalData`. . I've decided to adopt two different strategy : ; 1. For `DataFileName` I didn't put my component and still usef the 'setParent' strategy. This is because, a priori, we won't chage a filename data during execution, this is often a given parameter, but we often use methods specific to `DataFileName`. ; 2. For the topological one, usually topological mechanisms are used in very specific classes to handle topological changes. But in a user perspective, it is often used as a classical `Data<vector<Index>>`. So What I did is use `RenamedData` on those, allowing the compat on the `Data<T>` level, but not for the topological methods which are not working anymore on the old symbol (and will create a compilation error if used)... ; ; To make it cleaner we might need to create new `RenamedData` class for all classes inheriting from `Data<T>`. Which is not the purpose of this PR. . ______________________________________________________.

Testability,"""Fix"" the dreaded test UtilsTest.string_to_widestring_to_string; which pass only if the test has been launched with a UTF-8 locale. I tried setting TemporaryLocale to UTF-8 but it was still not working. ; (same with `setlocale(LC_ALL, ""en_US.UTF-8"");` coming directly from an example of cppreference). Last try was to simply avoid running the test if we detect the system is not UTF-8. Related to #2290. ______________________________________________________.
