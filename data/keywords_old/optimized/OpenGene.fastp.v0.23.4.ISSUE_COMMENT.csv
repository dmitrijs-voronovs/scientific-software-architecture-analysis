Availability,"> Hi @bamorim-bio I have the same warning. Did you figure this out?. Hi! I did. So I figure that this error occurred with samples that had different number of sequences in the different reads. So for example, I had sample A that had 1.7M seqs of reads 1 and 1M of reads 2. I had to find a way to fix this as the error kept persisting with my downstream analysis (even if I found other software like fastp that could run with these unequal lengths, when aligning with BWA I had also had errors). . What ended up working for me was repairing reads with [bbtools](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/repair-guide/). repair.sh -Xmx14g in1=SampleA_R1.fastq.gz in2=SampleA_R2.fastq.gz out1=SampleA_R1_repaired.fastq.gz out2=SampleA_R2_repaired.fastq.gz outs=/SampleA_single.fastq.gz repair.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is.

Integrability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

Integrability,"Hi,; I think global trimming is just removing a fixed number of bases from either end of the reads. And for trimming by quality, both Naive and Phred algorithms use quality scores (http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=144154&postcount=17), but naive takes the quality score as an integer without taking into account the error probability it represents unlike the Phred algorithm.; The reason I mentioned adapter trimming is because it outperforms `bbduk.sh` from `BBTools` in that particular task, however `bbduk.sh` uses the PHRED algorithm to trim by quality which makes it better suited for the trimming. At the end, I am looking forward to simplify my pre-processing of the reads ideally using a single program.; By the way, I really like the format of the reports, is a really good idea.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/159#issuecomment-497727543:411,adapter,adapter,411,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/159#issuecomment-497727543,1,['adapter'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

Modifiability,"Hi,; I think global trimming is just removing a fixed number of bases from either end of the reads. And for trimming by quality, both Naive and Phred algorithms use quality scores (http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=144154&postcount=17), but naive takes the quality score as an integer without taking into account the error probability it represents unlike the Phred algorithm.; The reason I mentioned adapter trimming is because it outperforms `bbduk.sh` from `BBTools` in that particular task, however `bbduk.sh` uses the PHRED algorithm to trim by quality which makes it better suited for the trimming. At the end, I am looking forward to simplify my pre-processing of the reads ideally using a single program.; By the way, I really like the format of the reports, is a really good idea.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/159#issuecomment-497727543:411,adapt,adapter,411,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/159#issuecomment-497727543,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"I refactored the `cut by quality` features to make it more clear, now the document is:. `fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window. From `v0.19.6`, `fastp` supports 3 different operations, and you enable one or all of them:; * `-5, --cut_front` move a sliding window from front (5') to tail, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The leading N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_front_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_front_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `LEADING` method.; * `-3, --cut_tail` move a sliding window from tail (3') to front, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The trailing N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_tail_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_tail_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `TRAILING` method.; * `-r, --cut_right` move a sliding window from front to tail, if meet one window with mean quality < threshold, drop the bases in the window and the right part, and then stop. Use `cut_right_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_right_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. This is similar as the Trimmomatic `SLIDINGWINDOW` method. ***WARNING: all these three operations will interfere deduplication for SE data, and `--cut_front` or `--cut_right` may also interfere deduplication for PE data. The deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.***. If `--cut_right` is enabled, then there is no need to enable `--cut_tail`, since the former is more aggressive.

Run the following commands to add the channels:; ```; conda config --add channels bioconda; conda config --add channels conda-forge; ```. 2. Create a new `conda` environment (I specified `python=3.9`, not sure if it is necessary); ```; conda create -n my_env python=3.9; ```. 3. All packages should be installed from the `conda-forge` channel, but just to make sure activate the environment and run; ```; conda update --all; ```. 4. Install `fastp` and it should give you version `0.23.2` by simply doing; ```; conda install fastp; ```. Hopefully it will also work for you!

Safety,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

Usability,"Hi, ; sry for bothering ;-) that's a solid point and I totally agree with you that tools should not be too complicated! . But i guess there isn't so much of additional complexity involved here... Fastp knows when it deals with PE data due to the `-i <input-1-file>` / `-I <input-2-file>` parameters; - If the user wants the paired unmerged files, this could simply be implicitly specified by `-o <output-1-file>` / `-O <output-2-file>`; - If merged reads are wanted, this is currently specified by `-m`. All you need to add is a related argument, so it would become `-m <merged-output-file>`; - If residual unpaired and unmerged reads are desired, just go for `-s <residual-output-file>`. So everything that needs to be changed would be a new argument to the `-m` parameter... ...and in addition, a new **optional** (and distinct from the merged read functionality) parameter/argument `-s <residual-output-file>` could be added. . I see that at least the second one can't be implemented right away and might take a while. But I would love to see this on the agenda because, by fulfilling these requirements, **fastp** would make a giant leap in terms your **an ultra-fast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor** credo.

Usability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

Usability,"Hi,; I think global trimming is just removing a fixed number of bases from either end of the reads. And for trimming by quality, both Naive and Phred algorithms use quality scores (http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=144154&postcount=17), but naive takes the quality score as an integer without taking into account the error probability it represents unlike the Phred algorithm.; The reason I mentioned adapter trimming is because it outperforms `bbduk.sh` from `BBTools` in that particular task, however `bbduk.sh` uses the PHRED algorithm to trim by quality which makes it better suited for the trimming. At the end, I am looking forward to simplify my pre-processing of the reads ideally using a single program.; By the way, I really like the format of the reports, is a really good idea.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/159#issuecomment-497727543:651,simpl,simplify,651,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/159#issuecomment-497727543,1,['simpl'],['simplify']

Usability,"I refactored the `cut by quality` features to make it more clear, now the document is:. `fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window. From `v0.19.6`, `fastp` supports 3 different operations, and you enable one or all of them:; * `-5, --cut_front` move a sliding window from front (5') to tail, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The leading N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_front_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_front_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `LEADING` method.; * `-3, --cut_tail` move a sliding window from tail (3') to front, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The trailing N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_tail_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_tail_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `TRAILING` method.; * `-r, --cut_right` move a sliding window from front to tail, if meet one window with mean quality < threshold, drop the bases in the window and the right part, and then stop. Use `cut_right_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_right_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. This is similar as the Trimmomatic `SLIDINGWINDOW` method. ***WARNING: all these three operations will interfere deduplication for SE data, and `--cut_front` or `--cut_right` may also interfere deduplication for PE data. The deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.***. If `--cut_right` is enabled, then there is no need to enable `--cut_tail`, since the former is more aggressive.
