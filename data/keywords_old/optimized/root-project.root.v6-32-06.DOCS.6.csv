Unallocated stack space is expected to match the Address Tag of; SP; this allows to skip tagging of any variable when memory safety can; be statically proven. Allocating a truly random tag for each stack variable in a large; function may incur significant code size overhead, because it means; that each variable's address is an independent, non-rematerializable; value; thus a function with N local variables will have extra N live; values to keep through most of its life time. For this reason MemTagSanitizer generates at most one random tag per; function, called a ""base tag"". Other stack variables, if there are; any, are assigned tags at a fixed offset from the base.

One method of building the libraries in step 2. is to build them ""stand-alone"".; A stand-alone build doesn't involve the rest of the LLVM tree. The steps are:. * ``cd build-dir``; * ``cmake -DLLVM_PATH=<path to llvm checkout e.g. /llvm-project/> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install path> <other options> <path to project e.g. /llvm-project/libcxxabi>``; * ``<make program e.g. ninja>``; * ``<make program> install``.

Common CMake configuration options:; -----------------------------------. * ``-D_LIBCPP_ABI_FORCE_ITANIUM'``. Tell the libc++ headers that the Itanium C++ ABI is being used. * ``-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-lmsvcrt -llegacy_stdio_definitions -D_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE""``. Supply CRT definitions including stdio definitions that have been removed from the MS VS CRT.; We don't want the stdio functions declared inline as they will cause multiple definition; errors when the same symbols are pulled in from legacy_stdio_definitions.ib. * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install path>``. Where to install the library and headers. Building libunwind:; -------------------. * ``-DLIBUNWIND_ENABLE_SHARED=ON``; * ``-DLIBUNWIND_ENABLE_STATIC=OFF``. libunwind can be built as a DLL. It is not dependent on other projects. * ``-DLIBUNWIND_USE_COMPILER_RT=OFF``. We use the MS runtime.

Fixed the dictionary generation in the case of class inside a namespace; marked inlined. Added mechanisms to stop the dictionary generation while parsing the XML and while selecting in presence of duplicates. Fix [ROOT-7760] : fully allow the usage of the dylib extension on OSx. Fix [ROOT-7723] : allow IOCtors to have as argument a ref to a type called __void__. We added a dictionary for map<string,string> as part of the default STL dictionary. We added support for template parameter packs in class name involved in the I/O. ### Thread safety and thread awareness. We added the function `TMethodCall::GetCallFunc` to allow direct access to the function wrapper. We reduced thread serialization in `TClass::GetCheckSum`, `TClass::GetBaseClassOffset` and `TClass::Property`. `TObjArray::Delete` was updated to allow its caller to explicitly avoid costly checks (extra RecursiveRemove and lock). We removed the need to create a TThread object per thread in a multi-threaded application. Now ROOT can be used with any threading model (e.g. OpenMP, STL threads, TBB) transparently. All the internal synchronisation mechanisms of ROOT are activated by a single call: `ROOT::EnableThreadSafety()` which is the successor of the existing `TThread::Initialize`. This call must take place if ROOT needs to be used in a thread safe manner. The implementation of TSemaphore was redone based on C++11 thread primitive in order to prevent cases where some of request post were lost. ### TDirectory::TContext. We added a default constructor to `TDirectory::TContext` which record the current directory; and will restore it at destruction time and does not change the current directory. The constructor for `TDirectory::TContext` that takes a single TDirectory pointer as; an argument was changed to set `gDirectory` to zero when being passed a null",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md:2312,update,updated,2312,README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"hod, for example, the; current LLVM tool will pop up a window containing the CFG for the function where; each basic block is a node in the graph, and each node contains the instructions; in the block. Similarly, there also exists ``Function::viewCFGOnly()`` (does; not include the instructions), the ``MachineFunction::viewCFG()`` and; ``MachineFunction::viewCFGOnly()``, and the ``SelectionDAG::viewGraph()``; methods. Within GDB, for example, you can usually use something like ``call; DAG.viewGraph()`` to pop up a window. Alternatively, you can sprinkle calls to; these functions in your code in places you want to debug. Getting this to work requires a small amount of setup.

The programs need not be present when configuring, building or; running LLVM and can simply be installed when needed during an active debug; session. ``SelectionDAG`` has been extended to make it easier to locate *interesting*; nodes in large complex graphs. From gdb, if you ``call DAG.setGraphColor(node,; ""color"")``, then the next ``call DAG.viewGraph()`` would highlight the node in; the specified color (choices of colors can be found at `colors; <http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/colors.html>`_.)

We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address [ROOT-5078]. It can be controlled from the `TTreeCloner`, `TTree::CopyEntries` or `hadd` interfaces.

Finally,; after about four months we had a histogramming package that was faster; and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based HBOOK; histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new; technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born; ROOT. Since its first public release at the end of 1995, ROOT has; enjoyed an ever-increasing popularity. Currently it is being used in; all major High Energy and Nuclear Physics laboratories around the; world to monitor, to store and to analyse data. In the other sciences; as well as the medical and financial industries, many people are using; ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several thousand; people. In 1997, Eric Raymond analysed in his paper ""The Cathedral and; the Bazaar"" the development method that makes Linux such a success.; The essence of that method is: ""release early, release often and; listen to your customers"". This is precisely how ROOT is being; developed. Over the last five years, many of our ""customers"" became; co-developers. Here we would like to thank our main co-developers and; contributors:. **Masaharu Goto** wrote the C++ interpreter CINT that was an; essential part of ROOT before ROOT 6.

A retainable object pointer is either a :arc-term:`null pointer` or a pointer; to a valid object. Furthermore, if it has block pointer type and is not; ``null`` then it must actually be a pointer to a block object, and if it has; ``Class`` type (possibly protocol-qualified) then it must actually be a pointer; to a class object. Otherwise ARC does not enforce the Objective-C type system; as long as the implementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that objec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:13249,release,release,13249,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['release'],['release']

It's usually easy to tell: just look for; redirection or piping of the ``FileCheck`` call's stdout or stderr. .. _Test-specific substitutions:. **Test-specific substitutions:**. Additional substitutions can be defined as follows:. - Lit configuration files (e.g., ``lit.cfg`` or ``lit.local.cfg``) can define; substitutions for all tests in a test directory. They do so by extending the; substitution list, ``config.substitutions``. Each item in the list is a tuple; consisting of a pattern and its replacement, which lit applies using python's; ``re.sub`` function.; - To define substitutions within a single test file, lit supports the; ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives, described in detail below. So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-version=51 %{cflags} \; ; DEFINE: -emit-llvm -o - %s | \; ; DEFINE: FileCheck %{fcflags} %s. Alternatively, the above substitutions can be defined in a lit configuration; file to be shared with other test files. Either way, the test file can then; specify directives like the following to redefine the parameter substitutions as; desired before each use of ``%{check}`` in a ``RUN:`` line:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; REDEFINE: %{cflags} = -triple x86_64-apple-darwin10.6.0 -fopenmp-simd; ; REDEFINE: %{fcflags} = -check-prefix=SIMD; ; RUN: %{che",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:29242,configurat,configuration,29242,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

These result in edges from; the ``U*`` commits to their corresponding rewritten ``L*1`` commits.; The ``L*2`` commits did not do any merges from upstream. Note that the merge from ``U2`` to ``Lclang1`` appears redundant, but; if, say, ``U3`` changed some files in upstream clang, the ``Lclang1``; commit appearing after the ``Llld1`` commit would actually represent a; clang tree *earlier* in the upstream clang history. We want the; ``local/zip`` branch to accurately represent the state of our umbrella; history and so the edge ``U2 -> Lclang1`` is a visual reminder of what; clang's tree actually looks like in ``Lclang1``. Even so, the edge ``U3 -> Llld1`` could be problematic for future; merges from upstream. git will think that we've already merged from; ``U3``, and we have, except for the state of the clang tree. One; possible mitigation strategy is to manually diff clang between ``U2``; and ``U3`` and apply those updates to ``local/zip``. Another,; possibly simpler strategy is to freeze local work on downstream; branches and merge all submodules from the latest upstream before; running ``zip-downstream-fork.py``. If downstream merged each project; from upstream in lockstep without any intervening local commits, then; things should be fine without any special action. We anticipate this; to be the common case. The tree for ``Lclang1`` outside of clang will represent the state of; things at ``U3`` since all of the upstream projects not participating; in the umbrella history should be in a state respecting the commit; ``U3``. The trees for llvm and lld should correctly represent commits; ``Lllvm1`` and ``Llld1``, respectively. Commit ``UM3`` changed files not related to submodules and we need; somewhere to put them.

Many, many bugs have been fixed; thanks to everyone who has reported them!. #### Cling. Cling is now using a new just-in-time compilation engine called OrcJIT, a development based on MCJIT. It enables interpretation of inline assembly and exceptions; it will hopefully in the near future also support interpreting thread local storage (but doesn't at the moment). Thanks to the new JIT, cling also comes with debug symbols for interpreted code; you can enable them with "".debug"". #### Function evaluation. Function calls through TMethodCall etc have been accelerated. #### llvm / clang. llvm / clang were updated to r227800. This includes everything from the clang 3.6 release. ### Dictionary Generation. Detect usage of #pragma once for inlined headers. Turn on verbosity of genreflex if the VERBOSE environment variable is defined. Optimise forward declarations in rootmap files in order to make their interpretation faster. Propagate attributes specified in xml selection files to selected classes even when selected through typedefs. Optimise selection procedure caching selected declarations in the selection rules, therewith avoiding to query the AST twice. Include in the PCH all the STL and C headers to guarantee portability of binaries from SLC6 to CC7. ## I/O Libraries. ### I/O New functionalities. - Support for forward_list and I/O of unordered stl containers.; - Support for std::complex. ### I/O Behavior change. - The I/O now properly skip the content of base class onfile that have been removed from the in-memory class layout. - The scheduling the I/O customization rules within a StreamerInfo is now as soon as possible, i.e. after all sources have bee",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md:7846,release,release,7846,README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,1,['release'],['release']

It can now tolerate a few failed fits when conducting hypothesis tests.; This is relevant when a few points in a parameter scan don't converge due to numerical or model instabilities.; These points will be skipped, and HypoTestInverter can continue.; - Tweak pull / residual plots. ROOT automatically zoomed out a bit when a pull / residual plot is created. Now, the; axis range of the original plot is transferred to the residual plot, so the pulls can be drawn below the main plot. ### Massive speed up of RooFit's `BatchMode` on CPUs with vector extensions. RooFit's [`BatchMode`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8) has been around; [since ROOT 6.20](https://root.cern/doc/v620/release-notes.html#fast-function-evaluation-and-vectorisation), but to; fully use vector extensions of modern CPUs, a manual compilation of ROOT was necessary, setting the required compiler flags. Now, RooFit comes with dedicated computation libraries, each compiled for a specific CPU architecture. When RooFit is loaded for the; first time, ROOT inspects the CPU capabilities, and loads the fastest supported version of this computation library.; This means that RooFit can now use vector extensions such as AVX2 without being recompiled, which enables a speed up of up to 4x for certain computations.; Combined with better data access patterns (~3x speed up, ROOT 6.20), computations with optimised PDFs speed up between 4x and 16x. The fast `BatchMode` now also works in combination with multi processing (`NumCPU`) and with binned data (`RooDataHist`).

Deployability,"iant.load and TBAA's constant flags. Pass Ordering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One of the most common mistakes made by new language frontend projects is to; use the existing -O2 or -O3 pass pipelines as is. These pass pipelines make a; good starting point for an optimizing compiler for any language, but they have; been carefully tuned for C and C++, not your target language. You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order. I Still Can't Find What I'm Looking For; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you didn't find what you were looking for above, consider proposing a piece; of metadata which provides the optimization hint you need. Such extensions are; relatively common and are generally well received by the community. You will; need to ensure that your proposal is sufficiently general so that it benefits; others if you wish to contribute it upstream. You should also consider describing the problem you're facing on `Discourse; <https://discourse.llvm.org>`_ and asking for advice.; It's entirely possible someone has encountered your problem before and can; give good advice. If there are multiple interested parties, that also; increases the chances that a metadata extension would be well received by the; community as a whole.

Deployability,"ic Libraries; =========================. All libraries that you compile as part of your build will be; cross-compiled to your target, and your build system will probably; find them in the right place. But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during build time, not configure time. Also, finding the libraries for your target are not as easy; as for your host machine. There aren't many cross-libraries available; as packages to most OS's, so you'll have to either cross-compile them; from source, or download the package for your target platform,; extract the libraries and headers, put them in specific directories; and add ``-I`` and ``-L`` pointing to them. Also, some libraries have different dependencies on different targets,; so configuration tools to find dependencies in the host can get the; list wrong for the target platform. This means that the configuration; of your build can get things wrong when setting their own library; paths, and you'll have to augment it via additional flags (configure,; Make, CMake, etc). Multilibs; ---------. When you want to cross-compile to more than one configuration, for; example hard-float-ARM and soft-float-ARM, you'll have to have multiple; copies of your libraries and (possibly) headers. Some Linux distributions have support for Multilib, which handle that; for you in an easier way, but if you're not careful and, for instance,; forget to specify ``-ccc-gcc-name armv7l-linux-gnueabihf-gcc`` (which; uses hard-float), Clang will pick the ``armv7l-linux-gnueabi-ld``; (which uses soft-float) and linker errors will happen.

One of them is in the MathCore library while the other is in the MathMore wrapping an integration function from the GSL library.; * RichardsonDerivator: Implements the Richardson method for numerical integration. It can calculate up to the third derivative of a function.; * GSLDerivator of *MathMore* based on GSL. ## Numerical Minimization. The algorithms provided by ROOT for numerical integration are implemented following the hierarchy shown in the next image. The left branch of classes are used for one dimensional minimization, while; the right one is used for multidimensional minimization. In the case of multidimensional minimization we have also the classes `TMinuitMinimizer` implemented using `TMinuit`, `TFumiliMinimizer`; implemented using `TFumili` for least square or likelihood minimizations.; We encourage the use of the GSL algorithms for one dimensional minimization and `Minuit2` (or the old version`Minuit`) for multi dimensional minimization. ![Numerical Minimization classes](pictures/Minimization.png). ### One-Dimensional Minimization. These algorithms are for finding the minimum of a one-dimensional minimization function.; The function to minimize must be given to the class implementing the algorithm as a; `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim` object.; The algorithms supported are only bracketing algorithm which do not use derivatives information.

Deployability,"ice element could also capture the source locations of the branches that; lead us to the corresponding program point. Diagnostics would use this; information to show a sample buggy code path to the user. ## Example: refactoring raw pointers to `unique_ptr`. Modern idiomatic C++ uses smart pointers to express memory ownership, however in; pre-C++11 code one can often find raw pointers that own heap memory blocks. Imagine that we would like to refactor raw pointers that own memory to; `unique_ptr`. There are multiple ways to design a data flow analysis for this; problem; let's look at one way to do it. For example, we would like to refactor the following code that uses raw; pointers:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; int *pi = new int;; if (...) {; Borrow(pi);; delete pi;; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi);; }; }; ```. into code that uses `unique_ptr`:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; auto pi = std::make_unique<int>();; if (...) {; Borrow(pi.get());; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi.release());; }; }; ```. This problem can be solved with a lattice in form of map from value declarations; to pointer states:. ![Lattice that identifies candidates for unique_ptr refactoring](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/UniquePtrLattice.svg). We can perform the refactoring if at the exit of a function `pi` is; `Compatible`. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership1() {; int *pi; // pi is Compatible; pi = new int; // pi is Defined; if (...) {; Borrow(pi); // pi is Defined; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; } else {; TakeOwnership(pi); // pi is Compatible; }; // pi is Compatible; }; ```. Let's look at an example where the raw pointer owns two different memory blocks:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership2() {; int *pi = new int; // pi is Defined; Borrow(pi);; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; if (smth) {; pi = new int; // pi is Defined; Borrow(pi);; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; }; // pi is Compatible; }; ```.

Deployability,"ict how you use it.; In particular, it is possible to use the clang preprocessor and parser to build; an extremely quick and light-weight on-the-fly code generator (similar to TCC); that does not build an AST at all. As an intermediate step, clang supports; using the current AST generation and semantic analysis code and having a code; generation client free the AST for each function after code generation. Finally,; clang provides support for building and retaining fully-fledged ASTs, and even; supports writing them out to disk.; Designing the libraries with clean and simple APIs allows these high-level; policy decisions to be determined in the client, instead of forcing ""one true; way"" in the implementation of any of these libraries. Getting this right is; hard, and we don't always get it right the first time, but we fix any problems; when we realize we made a mistake. Integration with IDEs. We believe that Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) are a great way; to pull together various pieces of the development puzzle, and aim to make clang; work well in such an environment. The chief advantage of an IDE is that they; typically have visibility across your entire project and are long-lived; processes, whereas stand-alone compiler tools are typically invoked on each; individual file in the project, and thus have limited scope.; There are many implications of this difference, but a significant one has to; do with efficiency and caching: sharing an address space across different files; in a project, means that you can use intelligent caching and other techniques to; dramatically reduce analysis/compilation time.; A further difference between IDEs and batch compiler is that they often; impose very different requirements on the front-end: they depend on high; performance in order to provide a ""snappy"" experience, and thus really want; techniques like ""incremental compilation"", ""fuzzy parsing"", etc. Finally, IDEs; often have very different requirements than code gener",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html:9157,Integrat,Integrated,9157,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,1,['Integrat'],['Integrated']
Deployability,"icularly important when; using clang as a compiler, since the clang compiler does not support; anywhere near all the options that gcc does, and we want to make sure; users know which ones are being used. To support this, the driver maintains a bit associated with each; argument of whether it has been used (at all) during the compilation.; This bit usually doesn't need to be set by hand, as the key ArgList; accessors will set it automatically. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks the bit and emits an ""unused argument"" warning for any arguments; which were never accessed. This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice. The upside is that the clang driver is more efficient and does little; extra work to support universal builds. It also provides better error; reporting and UI consistency. - **Specs**. The clang driver has no direct correspondent for ""specs"". The; majority of the functionality that is embedded in specs is in the; Tool specific argument translation routines. The parts of specs which; control the compilation pipeline are generally part of the *Pipeline*; stage. - **Too",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:15293,integrat,integrated,15293,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

There are also less commonly used components, as: 3D Graphics,; Parallel Processing (PROOF), Run Time Type Identification (RTTI),; Socket and Network Communication, Threads. #### Advantages of Frameworks. The benefits of frameworks can be summarized as follows:. - Less code to write - the programmer should be able to use and; reuse the majority of the existing code. Basic functionality, such; as fitting and histogramming are implemented and ready to use and; customize. - More reliable and robust code - the code inherited from a; framework has already been tested and integrated with the rest of; the framework. - More consistent and modular code - the code reuse provides; consistency and common capabilities between programs, no matter; who writes them. Frameworks make it easier to break programs into; smaller pieces. - More focus on areas of expertise - users can concentrate on their; particular problem domain. They do not have to be experts at; writing user interfaces, graphics, or networking to use the; frameworks that provide those services. ### Why Object-Oriented?. Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to; Procedure-Oriented Programming:. - Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity; for reuse. - Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify; objects. - Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide; a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the; relationships among them. - Complexity is reduced because there is ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:7487,integrat,integrated,7487,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

Please note that value of ``n`` used to create the upper; bound is ``10``, not ``100``, in this case because ``10`` is the actual length; of ``vla``, the value of ``n`` at the time when the array is being allocated. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void) {; int n = 10;; int vla[n];; n = 100;; int *p = vla; // { .ptr: &vla[0], .upper: &vla[10], .lower: &vla[0] }; // it's `&vla[10]` because the value of `n` was 10 at the; // time when the array is actually allocated.; // ...; }. By promoting array references to ``__bidi_indexable``, all array accesses are; bounds checked in ``-fbounds-safety``, just as ``__bidi_indexable`` pointers; are. Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations; ---------------------------------------------. ``-fbounds-safety`` maintains correctness of bounds annotations by performing; additional checks when a pointer object and/or its related value containing the; bounds information is updated. For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them.

Deployability,"iew Policy and Practices; =====================================. LLVM's code-review policy and practices help maintain high code quality across; the project. Specifically, our code review process aims to:. * Improve readability and maintainability.; * Improve robustness and prevent the introduction of defects.; * Best leverage the experience of other contributors for each proposed change.; * Help grow and develop new contributors, through mentorship by community leaders. It is important for all contributors to understand our code-review; practices and participate in the code-review process. General Policies; ================. What Code Should Be Reviewed?; -----------------------------. All developers are required to have significant changes reviewed before they; are committed to the repository. Must Code Be Reviewed Prior to Being Committed?; -----------------------------------------------. Code can be reviewed either before it is committed or after. We expect; significant patches to be reviewed before being committed. Smaller patches; (or patches where the developer owns the component) that meet; likely-community-consensus requirements (as apply to all patch approvals) can; be committed prior to an explicit review. In situations where there is any; uncertainty, a patch should be reviewed prior to being committed. Please note that the developer responsible for a patch is also; responsible for making all necessary review-related changes, including; those requested during any post-commit review. .. _post_commit_review:. Can Code Be Reviewed After It Is Committed?; -------------------------------------------. Post-commit review is encouraged, and can be accomplished using any of the; tools detailed below. There is a strong expectation that authors respond; promptly to post-commit feedback and address it. Failure to do so is cause for; the patch to be :ref:`reverted <revert_policy>`.

If you do this, you must squash and merge before landing the PR and; you must use the pull request title and description as the commit message.; You can do this manually with an interactive git rebase or with GitHub's; built-in tool. See the section about landing your fix below. When pushing to your branch, make sure you push to the correct fork. Check your; remotes with:. ::. git remote -v. And make sure you push to the remote that's pointing to your fork. Rebasing Pull Requests and Force Pushes; ---------------------------------------; In general, you should avoid rebasing a Pull Request and force pushing to the; branch that's the root of the Pull Request during the review. This action will; make the context of the old changes and comments harder to find and read. Sometimes, a rebase might be needed to update your branch with a fix for a test; or in some dependent code. After your PR is reviewed and accepted, you want to rebase your branch to ensure; you won't encounter merge conflicts when landing the PR. Landing your change; -------------------; When your PR has been accepted you can use the web interface to land your change.; If you have created multiple commits to address feedback at this point you need; to consolidate those commits into one commit. There are two different ways to; do this:. `Interactive rebase <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode>`_; with fixup's. This is the recommended method since you can control the final; commit message and inspect that the final commit looks as you expect. When; your local state is correct, remember to force-push to your branch and press; the merge button afterwards. Use the button `Squash and merge` in GitHub's web interface, if you do this; remember to review the commit message when prompted. Afterwards you can select the option `Del",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GitHub.rst:4552,update,update,4552,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GitHub.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GitHub.rst,1,['update'],['update']

To match all files in a directory, use e.g. ``foo/bar/*``. To match all files in; the directory of the ``.clang-format-ignore`` file, use ``*``.; Multiple ``.clang-format-ignore`` files are supported similar to the; ``.clang-format`` files, with a lower directory level file voiding the higher; level ones. Vim Integration; ===============. There is an integration for :program:`vim` which lets you run the; :program:`clang-format` standalone tool on your current buffer, optionally; selecting regions to reformat. The integration has the form of a `python`-file; which can be found under `clang/tools/clang-format/clang-format.py`. This can be integrated by adding the following to your `.vimrc`:. .. code-block:: vim. if has('python'); map <C-K> :pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; imap <C-K> <c-o>:pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; elseif has('python3'); map <C-K> :py3f <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; imap <C-K> <c-o>:py3f <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; endif. The first line enables :program:`clang-format` for NORMAL and VISUAL mode, the; second line adds support for INSERT mode. Change ""C-K"" to another binding if; you need :program:`clang-format` on a different key (C-K stands for Ctrl+k). With this integration you can press the bound key and clang-format will; format the current line in NORMAL and INSERT mode or the selected region in; VISUAL mode.

As our change is fairly simple, we'll add the cfe-commits mailing list; as a subscriber; anyone who works on clang can likely pick up the; review. (For changes outside clang, llvm-commits is the usual list. See; `http://lists.llvm.org/ <http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo>`__ for; all the \*-commits mailing lists). Uploading a change for review; -----------------------------. LLVM code reviews happen through pull-request on GitHub, see; :ref:`GitHub <github-reviews>` documentation for how to open; a pull-request on GitHub. Review process; --------------. When you open a pull-request, some automation will add a comment and; notify different member of the projects depending on the component you; changed.; Within a few days, someone should start the review. They may add; themselves as a reviewer, or simply start leaving comments. You'll get; another email any time the review is updated. The details are in the; `https://llvm.org/docs/CodeReview/ <https://llvm.org/docs/CodeReview.html>`__. Comments; ~~~~~~~~. The reviewer can leave comments on the change, and you can reply. Some; comments are attached to specific lines, and appear interleaved with the; code. You can either reply to these, or address them and mark them as; ""done"". Note that in-line replies are **not** sent straight away! They; become ""draft"" comments and you must click ""Submit"" at the bottom of the; page. Updating your change; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. If you make changes in response to a reviewer's comments, simply update; your branch with more commits and push to your fork. It may be a good; idea to answer the comments from the reviewer explicitly. Accepting a revision; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. When the reviewer is happy with the change, they will **Accept** the; revision. They may leave some more minor comments that you should; address, but at this point the review is complete.

Usually `Xlib` is not thread safe. This means that calls to the X could; fail, when it receives X-messages from different threads. The actual; result depends strongly on which version of `Xlib` has been installed on; your system.

The ``__has_feature`` macro can be used to query if certain standard language; features are enabled. The ``__has_extension`` macro can be used to query if; language features are available as an extension when compiling for a standard; which does not provide them. The features which can be tested are listed here. Since Clang 3.4, the C++ SD-6 feature test macros are also supported.; These are macros with names of the form ``__cpp_<feature_name>``, and are; intended to be a portable way to query the supported features of the compiler.; See `the C++ status page <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#ts>`_ for; information on the version of SD-6 supported by each Clang release, and the; macros provided by that revision of the recommendations. C++98; -----. The features listed below are part of the C++98 standard. These features are; enabled by default when compiling C++ code. C++ exceptions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Use ``__has_feature(cxx_exceptions)`` to determine if C++ exceptions have been; enabled. For example, compiling code with ``-fno-exceptions`` disables C++; exceptions. C++ RTTI; ^^^^^^^^. Use ``__has_feature(cxx_rtti)`` to determine if C++ RTTI has been enabled. For; example, compiling code with ``-fno-rtti`` disables the use of RTTI. C++11; -----. The features listed below are part of the C++11 standard. As a result, all; these features are enabled with the ``-std=c++11`` or ``-std=gnu++11`` option; when compiling C++ code.

If no integration rule; 	 is passed, the 31 points rule is used as default. * 	 `ROOT::Math::Integration::kADAPTIVESINGULAR`: based on `gsl_integration_qags`. It is an integration type which can be used in the case of the presence of singularities.It uses the; Gauss-Kronrod 21-point integration rule. This is the default algorithm. Note that when using the common `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDIm` class the enumeration type defining the algorithm must be defined in the namespace `ROOT::Math::IntegrationOneDim` (to distinguish from; the multi-dimensional case) and the rule enumeration (or its corresponding integer) can be passed in the constructor of the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDIm`. ### Multi-dimensional Integration. The multi-dimensional integration algorithm should be applied to functions with dimension larger than one.; Adaptive multi-dimensional integration works for low function dimension, while MC integration can be applied to higher dimensions. #### Using `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim`. Here is a code example on how to use the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` class; (note that the class is defined in the header file `Math/Integrator.h`).

That is not very user friendly and a bit more effort is; expected, but no promises are made. C API Changes; -------------. * Stability Guarantees: The C API is, in general, a ""best effort"" for stability.; This means that we make every attempt to keep the C API stable, but that; stability will be limited by the abstractness of the interface and the; stability of the C++ API that it wraps. In practice, this means that things; like ""create debug info"" or ""create this type of instruction"" are likely to be; less stable than ""take this IR file and JIT it for my current machine"". * Release stability: We won't break the C API on the release branch with patches; that go on that branch, with the exception that we will fix an unintentional; C API break that will keep the release consistent with both the previous and; next release. * Testing: Patches to the C API are expected to come with tests just like any; other patch. * Including new things into the API: If an LLVM subcomponent has a C API already; included, then expanding that C API is acceptable. Adding C API for; subcomponents that don't currently have one needs to be discussed on the; `LLVM Discourse forums`_ for design and maintainability feedback prior to implementation. * Documentation: Any changes to the C API are required to be documented in the; release notes so that it's clear to external users who do not follow the; project how the C API is changing and evolving. .. _toolchain:.

The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this ROOT version, then re-configure ROOT to enable ; VecGeom and Vc support, using the flags -Dvc=ON -Dvecgeom=on; ; This has been implemented by Mihaela Gheata <Mihaela.Gheata@cern.ch>. ## Database Libraries. * Fix `TPgSQLStatement::SetBinary` to actually handle binary data (previous limited to ascii). ## Networking Libraries. * When seeing too many requested ranges, Apache 2.4 now simply sends the whole file; (MaxRanges configuration parameter).

The pass ``-transform-warning`` (``WarnMissedTransformationsPass``); emits such warnings. It should be placed after the last transformation; pass. The current pass pipeline has a fixed order in which transformations; passes are executed. A transformation can be in the followup of a pass; that is executed later and thus leftover. For instance, a loop nest; cannot be distributed and then interchanged with the current pass; pipeline. The loop distribution will execute, but there is no loop; interchange pass following such that any loop interchange metadata will; be ignored.

Deployability,"imization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described. The heart of the explicit approach is to construct (or rewrite) the IR in a; manner where the possible updates performed by the garbage collector are; explicitly visible in the IR. Doing so requires that we:. #. create a new SSA value for each potentially relocated pointer, and; ensure that no uses of the original (non relocated) value is; reachable after the safepoint,; #. specify the relocation in a way which is opaque to the compiler to; ensure that the optimizer can not introduce new uses of an; unrelocated value after a statepoint. This prevents the optimizer; from performing unsound optimizations.; #. recording a mapping of live pointers (and the allocation they're; associated with) for each statepoint. At the most abstract level, inserting a safepoint can be thought of as; replacing a call instruction with a call to a multiple return value; function which both calls the original target of the call, returns; its result, and returns updated values for any live pointers to; garbage collected objects. Note that the task of identifying all live pointers to garbage; collected values, transforming the IR to expose a pointer giving the; base object for every such live pointer, and inserting all the; intrinsics correctly is explicitly out of scope for this document.; The recommended approach is to use the :ref:`utility passes; <statepoint-utilities>` described below. This abstract function call is concretely represented by a sequence of; intrinsic calls known collectively as a ""statepoint relocation sequence"".

All of this is better explained in the ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` header. Basic Mode; ----------. XRay supports a basic logging mode which will trace the application's; execution, and periodically append to a single log. This mode can be; installed/enabled by setting ``xray_mode=xray-basic`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS``; environment variable.

The current major users of TableGen are :doc:`The LLVM Target-Independent; Code Generator <../CodeGenerator>` and the `Clang diagnostics and attributes; <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-errors-and-warnings>`_.

It is not installed in the system (or where; your sysroot is set to), since it has no use beyond LLVM's build process. Running TableGen; ----------------. TableGen runs just like any other LLVM tool. The first (optional) argument; specifies the file to read. If a filename is not specified, ``llvm-tblgen``; reads from standard input. To be useful, one of the `backends`_ must be used. These backends are; selectable on the command line (type '``llvm-tblgen -help``' for a list).

The original patch; author, for example, might no longer be an active contributor to the project. What Tools Are Used for Code Review?; ------------------------------------. Pre-commit code reviews are conducted on GitHub with Pull Requests. See; :ref:`GitHub <github-reviews>` documentation. When Is an RFC Required?; ------------------------. Some changes are too significant for just a code review. Changes that should; change the LLVM Language Reference (e.g., adding new target-independent; intrinsics), adding language extensions in Clang, and so on, require an RFC; (Request for Comment) email on the project's ``*-dev`` mailing list first. For; changes that promise significant impact on users and/or downstream code bases,; reviewers can request an RFC achieving consensus before proceeding with code; review. That having been said, posting initial patches can help with; discussions on an RFC. Code-Review Workflow; ====================. Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is; ready to be committed. Specifically, once a patch is sent out for review, it; needs an explicit approval before it is committed. Do not assume silent; approval, or solicit objections to a patch with a deadline. Acknowledge All Reviewer Feedback; ---------------------------------. All comments by reviewers should be acknowledged by the patch author. It is; generally expected that suggested changes will be incorporated into a future; revision of the patch unless the author and/or other reviewers can articulate a; good reason to do otherwise (and then the reviewers must agree). If a new patch; does not address all outstanding feedback, the author should explicitly state; that when providing the updated patch.

The missing pieces are a) integration with rewriting (RS4GC) from the; abstract machine model and b) support for optionally decomposing on stack; objects so as not to require heap maps for them. The later is required; for ease of integration with some collectors. Lowering Quality and Representation Overhead; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The current statepoint lowering is known to be somewhat poor. In the very; long term, we'd like to integrate statepoints with the register allocator;; in the near term this is unlikely to happen. We've found the quality of; lowering to be relatively unimportant as hot-statepoints are almost always; inliner bugs. Concerns have been raised that the statepoint representation results in a; large amount of IR being produced for some examples and that this; contributes to higher than expected memory usage and compile times. There's; no immediate plans to make changes due to this, but alternate models may be; explored in the future. Relocations Along Exceptional Edges; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Relocations along exceptional paths are currently broken in ToT. In; particular, there is current no way to represent a rethrow on a path which; also has relocations.

SCOPED_CAPABILITY; -----------------. *Previously*: ``SCOPED_LOCKABLE``. ``SCOPED_CAPABILITY`` is an attribute on classes that implement RAII-style; locking, in which a capability is acquired in the constructor, and released in; the destructor. Such classes require special handling because the constructor; and destructor refer to the capability via different names; see the; ``MutexLocker`` class in :ref:`mutexheader`, below. Scoped capabilities are treated as capabilities that are implicitly acquired; on construction and released on destruction. They are associated with; the set of (regular) capabilities named in thread safety attributes on the; constructor or function returning them by value (using C++17 guaranteed copy; elision). Acquire-type attributes on other member functions are treated as; applying to that set of associated capabilities, while ``RELEASE`` implies that; a function releases all associated capabilities in whatever mode they're held. TRY_ACQUIRE(<bool>, ...), TRY_ACQUIRE_SHARED(<bool>, ...); ---------------------------------------------------------. *Previously:* ``EXCLUSIVE_TRYLOCK_FUNCTION``, ``SHARED_TRYLOCK_FUNCTION``. These are attributes on a function or method that tries to acquire the given; capability, and returns a boolean value indicating success or failure.; The first argument must be ``true`` or ``false``, to specify which return value; indicates success, and the remaining arguments are interpreted in the same way; as ``ACQUIRE``. See :ref:`mutexheader`, below, for example uses. Because the analysis doesn't support conditional locking, a capability is; treated as acquired after the first branch on the return value of a try-acquire; function. .. code-block:: c++.

Deployability,"ing old iterators might slow it down by 5 to 10%. Iterators in key classes have been updated, such that many workflows in RooFit are 10 - 20% faster. #### Legacy iterators; The (three kinds) of legacy iterators in RooFit are still supported, such that old code will not break, but they are slower than `begin(), end()` and range-based for loops. **Important caveat**:; The old RooFit collections could be modified while iterating. The STL-like iterators do not support this (as for a *e.g.* std::vector)! Using the legacy iterators with the new collections (*i.e.* in existing code), mutating the collection is still possible in the following cases:; - Inserting/deleting elements **after** the current iterator.; - Changing an element at a position **other than** the current iterator; - **But not** inserting/deleting before/at the current iterator position. With a debug build (with assertions), the legacy iterators will check that the collection is not mutated. In a release build, elements might be skipped or be iterated twice. #### Moving away from the slower iterators; The legacy iterators have been flagged with a special deprecation macro that can be used help the user use the recommended ROOT interface. Defining one of the [deprecation macros](#preprocessor-deprecation-macros) (either in a single translation unit or in the build system), and creating a legacy iterator will trigger a compiler warning such as:; ```; <path>/RooChebychev.cxx:66:34: warning: 'createIterator' is deprecated: There is a superior alternative: begin(), end() and range-based for loops.

Deployability,"ing which; is currently required to link correctly. However, if that limitation is removed; then there are no other known issues with using link.exe. Currently, there is a lack of a usable Windows compiler driver for Windows Itanium.; A reasonable work-around is to build clang with a windows-msvc default target and; then override the triple with e.g. ""-Xclang -triple -Xclang x86_64-unknown-windows-itanium"".; The linker can be specified with: ""-fuse-ld=lld"". In the Itanium C++ ABI the first member of an object is a pointer to the vtable; for its class. The vtable is often emitted into the object file with the key function; and must be imported for classes marked dllimport. The pointers must be globally; unique. Unfortunately, the COFF/PE file format does not provide a mechanism to; store a runtime address from another DLL into this pointer (although runtime; addresses are patched into the IAT). Therefore, the compiler must emit some code,; that runs after IAT patching but before anything that might use the vtable pointers,; and sets the vtable pointer to the address from the IAT. For the special case of; the references to vtables for __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info from typeinto objects; there is no declaration available to the compiler so this can't be done. To allow; programs to link we currently rely on the -auto-import switch in LLD to auto-import; references to __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info pointers (see: https://reviews.llvm.org/D43184; for a related discussion). This allows for linking; but, code that actually uses; such fields will not work as they these will not be fixed up at runtime. See; _pei386_runtime_relocator which handles the runtime component of the autoimporting; scheme used for mingw and comments in https://reviews.llvm.org/D43184 and; https://reviews.llvm.org/D89518 for more.

Intrinsics; ==========. The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling. Each instance of one of these intrinsics generates a stack map record; in the :ref:`stackmap-section`. The record includes an ID, allowing; the runtime to uniquely identify the stack map, and the offset within; the code from the beginning of the enclosing function.

Deployability,"instruction sequence at run time. Patch points look; much like calls to LLVM. They take arguments that follow a calling; convention and may return a value. They also imply stack map; generation, which allows the runtime to locate the patchpoint and; find the location of ``live values`` at that point. Motivation; ==========. This functionality is currently experimental but is potentially useful; in a variety of settings, the most obvious being a runtime (JIT); compiler. Example applications of the patchpoint intrinsics are; implementing an inline call cache for polymorphic method dispatch or; optimizing the retrieval of properties in dynamically typed languages; such as JavaScript. The intrinsics documented here are currently used by the JavaScript; compiler within the open source WebKit project, see the `FTL JIT; <https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT>`_, but they are designed to be; used whenever stack maps or code patching are needed. Because the; intrinsics have experimental status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed. The stack map functionality described in this document is separate; from the functionality described in; :ref:`stack-map`. `GCFunctionMetadata` provides the location of; pointers into a collected heap captured by the `GCRoot` intrinsic,; which can also be considered a ""stack map"". Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack map. The stack maps described here could potentially provide; richer information to a garbage collecting runtime, but that usage; will not be discussed in this document. Intrinsics; ==========.

See the discussion in the section about; :ref:`merging locations<WhenToMergeLocation>` for examples of when the rule for; dropping locations applies. Rules for updating debug values; ===============================. Deleting an IR-level Instruction; --------------------------------. When an ``Instruction`` is deleted, its debug uses change to ``undef``. This is; a loss of debug info: the value of one or more source variables becomes; unavailable, starting with the ``llvm.dbg.value(undef, ...)``. When there is no; way to reconstitute the value of the lost instruction, this is the best; possible outcome. However, it's often possible to do better:. * If the dying instruction can be RAUW'd, do so. The; ``Value::replaceAllUsesWith`` API transparently updates debug uses of the; dying instruction to point to the replacement value. * If the dying instruction cannot be RAUW'd, call ``llvm::salvageDebugInfo`` on; it. This makes a best-effort attempt to rewrite debug uses of the dying; instruction by describing its effect as a ``DIExpression``. * If one of the **operands** of a dying instruction would become trivially; dead, use ``llvm::replaceAllDbgUsesWith`` to rewrite the debug uses of that; operand. Consider the following example function:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i16 @foo(i16 %a) {; %b = sext i16 %a to i32; %c = and i32 %b, 15; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %c, ...); %d = trunc i32 %c to i16; ret i16 %d; }.

This guide will hopefully lay the ground for more complex; applications in your future scientific work building on a modern,; state-of the art tool for data analysis. This guide in form of a tutorial is intended to introduce you quickly to the; ROOT package. This goal will be accomplished using concrete examples, according; to the ""learning by doing"" principle. Also because of this reason, this guide; cannot cover all the complexity of the ROOT package.

Deployability,"interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack maps. Direct Stack Map Entries; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As shown in :ref:`stackmap-section`, a Direct stack map location; records the address of frame index.

The actual floating point; precision of double precision (32–bit or 64–bit) is platform dependent; and can even vary on the same platform, depending on whether a floating; point number is read from memory a CPU register. The argument of the user's implementation of FCNBase::operator() is; therefore a std:vector$<$double$>$. M expects that the calculations; inside $\mbox{FCN}$ will be performed approximately to the same; accuracy. The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors.

Deployability,"ion Plan; ========================. Step #1 : Before The Move; -------------------------. 1. Update docs to mention the move, so people are aware of what is going on.; 2. Set up a read-only version of the GitHub project, mirroring our current SVN; repository.; 3. Add the required bots to implement the commit emails, as well as the; umbrella repository update (if the multirepo is selected) or the read-only; Git views for the sub-projects (if the monorepo is selected). Step #2 : Git Move; ------------------. 4. Update the buildbots to pick up updates and commits from the GitHub; repository. Not all bots have to migrate at this point, but it'll help; provide infrastructure testing.; 5. Update Phabricator to pick up commits from the GitHub repository.; 6. LNT and llvmlab have to be updated: they rely on unique monotonically; increasing integer across branch [MatthewsRevNum]_.; 7. Instruct downstream integrators to pick up commits from the GitHub; repository.; 8. Review and prepare an update for the LLVM documentation. Until this point nothing has changed for developers, it will just; boil down to a lot of work for buildbot and other infrastructure; owners. The migration will pause here until all dependencies have cleared, and all; problems have been solved. Step #3: Write Access Move; --------------------------. 9. Collect developers' GitHub account information, and add them to the project.; 10. Switch the SVN repository to read-only and allow pushes to the GitHub repository.; 11. Update the documentation.; 12. Mirror Git to SVN. Step #4 : Post Move; -------------------. 13. Archive the SVN repository.; 14. Update links on the LLVM website pointing to viewvc/klaus/phab etc. to; point to GitHub instead.

Instead, they are only the; values that the runtime requires to be live at this point. For; example, they may be the values the runtime will need to resume; program execution at that point independent of the compiled function; containing the stack map. LLVM emits stack map data into the object code within a designated; :ref:`stackmap-section`. This stack map data contains a record for; each stack map. The record stores the stack map's instruction address; and contains an entry for each mapped value. Each entry encodes a; value's location as a register, stack offset, or constant. A patch point is an instruction address at which space is reserved for; patching a new instruction sequence at run time. Patch points look; much like calls to LLVM. They take arguments that follow a calling; convention and may return a value. They also imply stack map; generation, which allows the runtime to locate the patchpoint and; find the location of ``live values`` at that point. Motivation; ==========. This functionality is currently experimental but is potentially useful; in a variety of settings, the most obvious being a runtime (JIT); compiler. Example applications of the patchpoint intrinsics are; implementing an inline call cache for polymorphic method dispatch or; optimizing the retrieval of properties in dynamically typed languages; such as JavaScript. The intrinsics documented here are currently used by the JavaScript; compiler within the open source WebKit project, see the `FTL JIT; <https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT>`_, but they are designed to be; used whenever stack maps or code patching are needed. Because the; intrinsics have experimental status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed. The stack map functionality described in this document is separate; from the functionality described in; :ref:`stack-map`. `GCFunctionMetadata` provides the location of; poin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:1435,patch,patchpoint,1435,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['patch'],['patchpoint']

If both variants are present, the default configuration; files are loaded first. The command line option ``--config=`` can be used to specify explicit; configuration files in a Clang invocation. If the option is used multiple times,; all specified files are loaded, in order. For example:. ::. clang --config=/home/user/cfgs/testing.txt; clang --config=debug.cfg --config=runtimes.cfg. If the provided argument contains a directory separator, it is considered as; a file path, and options are read from that file. Otherwise the argument is; treated as a file name and is searched for sequentially in the directories:. - user directory,; - system directory,; - the directory where Clang executable resides. Both user and system directories for configuration files are specified during; clang build using CMake parameters, ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_USER_DIR`` and; ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_SYSTEM_DIR`` respectively. The first file found is used.; It is an error if the required file cannot be found. The default configuration files are searched for in the same directories; following the rules described in the next paragraphs. Loading default; configuration files can be disabled entirely via passing; the ``--no-default-config`` flag. First, the algorithm searches for a configuration file named; ``<triple>-<driver>.cfg`` where `triple` is the triple for the target being; built for, and `driver` is the name of the currently used driver. The algorithm; first attempts to use the canonical name for the driver used, then falls back; to the one found in the executable name.

Note that, currently, `RVecs` written e.g. in a `TTree` cannot be read back; using certain ROOT interfaces (e.g. `TTreeReaderArray`, `RDataFrame` and the experimental `RNTuple`).

This causes the; constructor to automatically insert the new block into the end of the; specified function. The other two blocks are created, but aren't yet; inserted into the function. Once the blocks are created, we can emit the conditional branch that; chooses between them. Note that creating new blocks does not implicitly; affect the IRBuilder, so it is still inserting into the block that the; condition went into. Also note that it is creating a branch to the; ""then"" block and the ""else"" block, even though the ""else"" block isn't; inserted into the function yet. This is all ok: it is the standard way; that LLVM supports forward references. .. code-block:: c++. // Emit then value.; Builder->SetInsertPoint(ThenBB);. Value *ThenV = Then->codegen();; if (!ThenV); return nullptr;. Builder->CreateBr(MergeBB);; // Codegen of 'Then' can change the current block, update ThenBB for the PHI.; ThenBB = Builder->GetInsertBlock();. After the conditional branch is inserted, we move the builder to start; inserting into the ""then"" block. Strictly speaking, this call moves the; insertion point to be at the end of the specified block. However, since; the ""then"" block is empty, it also starts out by inserting at the; beginning of the block. :). Once the insertion point is set, we recursively codegen the ""then""; expression from the AST. To finish off the ""then"" block, we create an; unconditional branch to the merge block. One interesting (and very; important) aspect of the LLVM IR is that it :ref:`requires all basic; blocks to be ""terminated"" <functionstructure>` with a :ref:`control; flow instruction <terminators>` such as return or branch.

This header fits within 8 bytes on all platforms supported, and contributes to a; small overhead for each allocation. The checksum is computed using a CRC32 (made faster with hardware support); of the global secret, the chunk pointer itself, and the 8 bytes of header with; the checksum field zeroed out.

Randomness; ----------; Randomness is a critical factor to the additional security provided by the; allocator. The allocator trusts the memory mapping primitives of the OS to; provide pages at (mostly) non-predictable locations in memory, as well as the; binaries to be compiled with ASLR. In the event one of those assumptions is; incorrect, the security will be greatly reduced. Scudo further randomizes how; blocks are allocated in the Primary, can randomize how caches are assigned to; threads. Memory reclaiming; -----------------; Primary and Secondary allocators have different behaviors with regard to; reclaiming. While Secondary mapped allocations can be unmapped on deallocation,; it isn't the case for the Primary, which could lead to a steady growth of the; RSS of a process.

We will also emit diagnostics in Clang to prevent the use of; non-streaming(-compatible) operations, e.g. through ACLE intrinsics, when a; function is decorated with the streaming mode attributes. Other things to consider; ------------------------. * Inlining must be disabled when the call-site needs to toggle PSTATE.SM or; when the callee's function body is executed in a different streaming mode than; its caller. This is needed because function calls are the boundaries for; streaming mode changes. * Tail call optimization must be disabled when the call-site needs to toggle; PSTATE.SM, such that the caller can restore the original value of PSTATE.SM. 3. Handling PSTATE.ZA; =====================. In contrast to PSTATE.SM, enabling PSTATE.ZA does not affect the SVE vector; length and also doesn't clobber FP/AdvSIMD/SVE registers. This means it is safe; to toggle PSTATE.ZA using intrinsics. This also makes it simpler to setup a; lazy-save mechanism for calls to private-ZA functions (i.e. functions that may; either directly or indirectly clobber ZA state). For the purpose of handling functions marked with ``aarch64_pstate_za_new``,; we have introduced a new LLVM IR pass (SMEABIPass) that is run just before; SelectionDAG.

The C and C++ standards allow floating-point expressions to be computed as if; intermediate results had more precision (and/or a wider range) than the type; of the expression strictly allows. This is called excess precision; arithmetic.; Excess precision arithmetic can improve the accuracy of results (although not; always), and it can make computation significantly faster if the target lacks; direct hardware support for arithmetic in a particular type. However, it can; also undermine strict floating-point reproducibility. Under the standards, assignments and explicit casts force the operand to be; converted to its formal type, discarding any excess precision. Because data; can only flow between statements via an assignment, this means that the use; of excess precision arithmetic is a reliable local property of a single; statement, and results do not change based on optimization.

For example, if; you add hash tables to the language, it would probably make sense to; add the routines to a runtime, instead of inlining them all the way.; - **memory management** - Currently we can only access the stack in; Kaleidoscope. It would also be useful to be able to allocate heap; memory, either with calls to the standard libc malloc/free interface; or with a garbage collector. If you would like to use garbage; collection, note that LLVM fully supports `Accurate Garbage; Collection <../../GarbageCollection.html>`_ including algorithms that; move objects and need to scan/update the stack.; - **exception handling support** - LLVM supports generation of `zero; cost exceptions <../../ExceptionHandling.html>`_ which interoperate with; code compiled in other languages.

There are; many different ways to go here.; - **object orientation, generics, database access, complex numbers,; geometric programming, ...** - Really, there is no end of crazy; features that you can add to the language.; - **unusual domains** - We've been talking about applying LLVM to a; domain that many people are interested in: building a compiler for a; specific language.

Deployability,"ions have to; walk tons and tons of virtual variables and phi nodes. So we partition. At the point at which you partition, again,; experience has shown us there is no point in partitioning to more than; one variable. It simply generates more IR, and optimizations still; have to query something to disambiguate further anyway. As a result, LLVM partitions to one variable. Precision in practice; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In practice, there are implementation details in LLVM that also affect the; results' precision provided by ``MemorySSA``. For example, AliasAnalysis has various; caps, or restrictions on looking through phis which can affect what ``MemorySSA``; can infer. Changes made by different passes may make MemorySSA either ""overly; optimized"" (it can provide a more accurate result than if it were recomputed; from scratch), or ""under optimized"" (it could infer more if it were recomputed).; This can lead to challenges to reproduced results in isolation with a single pass; when the result relies on the state acquired by ``MemorySSA`` due to being updated by; multiple subsequent passes.; Passes that use and update ``MemorySSA`` should do so through the APIs provided by the; ``MemorySSAUpdater``, or through calls on the Walker.; Direct optimizations to ``MemorySSA`` are not permitted.; There is currently a single, narrowly scoped exception where DSE (DeadStoreElimination); updates an optimized access of a store, after a traversal that guarantees the; optimization is correct. This is solely allowed due to the traversals and inferences; being beyond what ``MemorySSA`` does and them being ""free"" (i.e. DSE does them anyway).; This exception is set under a flag (""-dse-optimize-memoryssa"") and can be disabled to; help reproduce optimizations in isolation.

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C; frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release |release|. Here we; describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major; improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the; general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM; documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. For the libc++ release notes,; see `this page <https://libcxx.llvm.org/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases; may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_. For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about the; latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the; `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_. Potentially Breaking Changes; ============================; These changes are ones which we think may surprise users when upgrading to; Clang |release| because of the opportunity they pose for disruption to existing; code bases. - Fix a bug in reversed argument for templated operators.; This breaks code in C++20 which was previously accepted in C++17.; Clang did not properly diagnose such casese in C++20 before this change. Eg:. .. code-block:: cpp. struct P {};; template<class S> bool operator==(const P&, const S&);. struct A : public P {};; struct B : public P {};. // This equality is now ambiguous in C++20.; bool ambiguous(A a, B b) { return a == b; }. template<class S> bool operator!=(const P&, const S&);; // Ok. Found a matching operator!=.; bool fine(A a, B b) { return a == b; }. To reduce such widespread breakages, as an extension, Clang accepts this code; with an existing warning ``-Wambiguous-reversed-operator`` warning.; Fixes `#53954 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53954>`_. - The CMake variable ``GCC_INSTALL_PREFIX`` (which sets the default; ``--gcc-toolchain=``) is deprec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst:1370,release,release,1370,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,1,['release'],['release']

Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a ``.ll`` file:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llvm-dis > %t1; ; RUN: llvm-dis < %s.bc-13 > %t2; ; RUN: diff %t1 %t2. As with a Unix shell, the RUN lines permit pipelines and I/O; redirection to be used. There are some quoting rules that you must pay attention to when writing; your RUN lines. In general nothing needs to be quoted. :program:`lit` won't; strip off any quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value. In general, you should strive to keep your RUN lines as simple as possible,; using them only to run tools that generate textual output you can then examine.; The recommended way to examine output to figure out if the test passes is using; the :doc:`FileCheck tool <CommandGuide/FileCheck>`. *[The usage of grep in RUN; lines is deprecated - please do not send or commit patches that use it.]*. Put related tests into a single file rather than having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated.

Another example:; ```; TChain::Add(""/path/to/tree/subdir[0-9]/*.root""); ```; This grabs all the root files in subdirectories that have a name starting with `subdir` and ending with some digit. ### Improved efficiency of TTree friends with indices. `TTreeIndex` and `TChainIndex` classes now implement the `Clone` method such that it does not use the ROOT I/O to clone the; index but just does a copy in memory. Notably, this improves processing efficiency for RDataFrame in multithreaded; execution since the same index must be copied over to all the threads and attached to the current tree for proper; event matching. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen a number of updates since the last release. Specifically, 6.32 includes the following changes:. - A major refactoring of the interface, improving consistency across different parts and improving overall robustness. **Note that this is a breaking change with regard to 6.30!**; - The on-disk format has been updated to release candidate 2. **It will not be possible to read RNTuples written in the previous format anymore.**; - Support has been added for several new field types: `std::unordered_set<T>`, `std::map<K,V>`, `std::unordered_map<K,V>`; - Support has been added for on-disk half-precision (IEEE 754-2008 16-bit) float fields. This can be enabled through `RField<float>::SetHalfPrecision()`. On reading, values of such fields are represented as regular, 32-bit floats.; - A new `RNTupleInspector` utility class has been added, to provide information about the on-disk metadata of an RNTuple.; - A new `RNTupleParallelWriter` class has been added, providing (initial) support for parallel writing of RNTuples.; - A new static method `RFieldBase::Check()` has been added, which produces a support status report of a type with regards to RNTuple I/O.; - A new internal `RNTupleMerger` class has been added, enabling the merging of different page sources into one page sink.

Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for the problem - one could load the file completely and exclude many partial I/O operations by this. To achieve this with JSROOT, one should add ""+"" sign at the end of the file name. Of course, it only could work for small files. If somebody still wants to use monitoring of data from ROOT files, could try link like:. - <https://root.cern/js/latest/?nobrowser&file=../files/hsimple.root+&item=hpx;1&monitoring=2000>.

Deployability,"is is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample CMake cache file located at; clang/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake. The following command will perform; and install the distribution build:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to clang>/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake <path to LLVM source>; $ ninja stage2-distribution; $ ninja stage2-install-distribution. Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:. Multi-distribution configurations; ---------------------------------. The ``install-distribution`` target described above is for building a single; distribution.

To measure the latency of a single; instruction, run:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=latency --opcode-name=ADD64rr. Measuring the uop decomposition or inverse throughput of an instruction works similarly:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=uops --opcode-name=ADD64rr; $ llvm-exegesis --mode=inverse_throughput --opcode-name=ADD64rr.

A new cross-protocol redirection has been added to allow files on EOS mounts to be opened; by `TFile::Open` via XRootD protocol rather than via FUSE when that is possible. The; redirection uses the `eos.url.xroot` extended file attribute that is present on files in EOS.; The attribute can be viewed with `getfattr -n eos.url.xroot [file]` on the command line.; When the URL passed into `TFile::Open` is a for a file on an EOS mount, the extended; attribute is used to attempt the redirection to XRootD protocol. If the redirection fails,; the file is opened using the plain file path as before. This feature is controlled by the; pre-existing configuration option `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` and is enabled by default.; It can be disabled by setting `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` to `0` in `rootrc`. ## TTree Libraries. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen many updates during the last few months. Specifically, v6.28 includes the following changes:. - Complete support for big-endian architectures (PR [#10402](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10402)). - Support for `std::pair<T1, T2>` and `std::tuple<Ts...>` fields. - Support for C array fields whose type is of the form `T[N]`. Note that only single-dimension arrays are currently supported. - Improvements to the ROOT file embedding (PR [#10558](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10558)). In particular, a `RNTupleReader` or `RDataFrame` object can be created from a `TFile` instance as follows; ```; auto f = TFile::Open(""data.root"");; auto ntpl = f->Get<ROOT::Experimental::RNTuple>(""Events"");. auto reader = ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleReader::Open(ntpl);; // or for RDataFrame; auto rdf = ROOT::Experimental::MakeNTupleDataFrame(ntpl);; ```. - If buffered write is enabled, vector writes are used where possible.

Sometimes reverting one change in a series can worsen things; instead of improving them. We expect reasonable judgment to ensure that; the proper patch or set of patches is being reverted.; * The commit message for the reverting commit should explain why patch; is being reverted.; * It is customary to respond to the original commit email mentioning the; revert. This serves as both a notice to the original author that their; patch was reverted, and helps others following llvm-commits track context.; * Ideally, you should have a publicly reproducible test case ready to share.; Where possible, we encourage sharing of test cases in commit threads, or; in PRs. We encourage the reverter to minimize the test case and to prune; dependencies where practical. This even applies when reverting your own; patch; documenting the reasons for others who might be following along; is critical.; * It is not considered reasonable to revert without at least the promise to; provide a means for the patch author to debug the root issue. If a situation; arises where a public reproducer can not be shared for some reason (e.g.; requires hardware patch author doesn't have access to, sharp regression in; compile time of internal workload, etc.), the reverter is expected to be; proactive about working with the patch author to debug and test candidate; patches.; * Reverts should be reasonably timely. A change submitted two hours ago; can be reverted without prior discussion. A change submitted two years ago; should not be. Where exactly the transition point is is hard to say, but; it's probably in the handful of days in tree territory. If you are unsure,; we encourage you to reply to the commit thread, give the author a bit to; respond, and then proceed with the revert if the author doesn't seem to be; actively responding.;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:21770,patch,patch,21770,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['patch'],['patch']
Deployability,"istribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample CMake cache file located at; clang/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake. The following command will perform; and install the distribution build:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to clang>/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake <path to LLVM source>; $ ninja stage2-distribution; $ ninja stage2-install-distribution. Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``.

As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:18375,configurat,configuration,18375,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

This also means that RNTuples can be merged through `hadd`.; - Zero-copy bulk reading has been added, with extra optimizations for `ROOT::RVec` fields.; - It is now possible to use the `RNTupleView` with an external address with type erasure, e.g.:; ```cpp; std::shared_ptr<void> data{new float()};; auto view = reader->GetView(""pt"", data);; ```; This enables use cases such as reading one specific entry of one specific field into a previously allocated memory location.; - Further integration with [RDataFrame](#rdataframe): it is now possible to create RDataFrame for chains of RNTuples. This addition also comes with improvements to the multi-threaded work scheduling.; - Many additional bug fixes and improvements.

Deployability,"ivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack maps. Direct Stack Map Entries; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As shown in :ref:`stackmap-section`, a Direct stack map location; records the address of frame index.

Each item in the list is a tuple; consisting of a pattern and its replacement, which lit applies using python's; ``re.sub`` function.; - To define substitutions within a single test file, lit supports the; ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives, described in detail below. So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-versi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:28640,configurat,configuration,28640,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"ivially ownership-qualified, additional rules apply. Both Objective-C and Objective-C++ support nontrivially ownership-qualified; fields. Due to formal differences between the standards, the formal; treatment is different; however, the basic language model is intended to; be the same for identical code. .. admonition:: Rationale. Permitting ``__strong`` and ``__weak`` references in aggregate types; allows programmers to take advantage of the normal language tools of; C and C++ while still automatically managing memory. While it is; usually simpler and more idiomatic to use Objective-C objects for; secondary data structures, doing so can introduce extra allocation; and message-send overhead, which can cause to unacceptable; performance. Using structs can resolve some of this tension. ``__autoreleasing`` is forbidden because it is treacherous to rely; on autoreleases as an ownership tool outside of a function-local; contexts. Earlier releases of Clang permitted ``__strong`` and ``__weak`` only; references in Objective-C++ classes, not in Objective-C. This; restriction was an undesirable short-term constraint arising from the; complexity of adding support for non-trivial struct types to C. In Objective-C++, nontrivially ownership-qualified types are treated; for nearly all purposes as if they were class types with non-trivial; default constructors, copy constructors, move constructors, copy assignment; operators, move assignment operators, and destructors. This includes the; determination of the triviality of special members of classes with a; non-static data member of such a type. In Objective-C, the definition cannot be so succinct: because the C; standard lacks rules for non-trivial types, those rules must first be; developed. They are given in the next section. The intent is that these; rules are largely consistent with the rules of C++ for code expressible; in both languages. Formal rules for non-trivial types in C; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

The minimum required version of CMake has been updated to 3.9 or newer to be; able to take advantage of new features such as native support for the CUDA; language, among other things. Please refer to CMake's release notes for further; information. The method to select the C++ standard has changed. Now the recommended way; to select the C++ standard is via the option `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=XX`, which; is the idiomatic way to do it in CMake. The old options still work, but have; been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Build option descriptions have been updated to indicate which builtins require; an active network connection during the build. You can inspect the list of; options and their descriptions by running `cmake -LH $PWD` in the build; directory. The build system has been updated to remove most file globbing to improve; the reliability of incremental builds when source files are added or removed. A new check has been added to make ROOT fail during the configuration step; if incompatible versions of the Python interpreter and its libraries are; selected.

The DenseMapInfo is responsible for; defining the appropriate comparison and hashing methods for each alternate key; type used.

It will report ""GNU; gold"" or else ""GNU ld"" if not. If gold is already installed at; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold``, one option is to simply make that the default by; backing up your existing ``/usr/bin/ld`` and creating a symbolic link; with ``ln -s /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld``. Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support. If not, and you get an error such as ""unknown option"",; then you will either need to build gold or install a version with plugin; support. * Download, configure and build gold with plugin support:. .. code-block:: bash. $ git clone --depth 1 git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils; $ mkdir build; $ cd build; $ ../binutils/configure --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werror; $ make all-gold. That should leave you with ``build/gold/ld-new`` which supports; the ``-plugin`` option. Running ``make`` will additionally build; ``build/binutils/ar`` and ``nm-new`` binaries supporting plugins. Once you're ready to switch to using gold, backup your existing; ``/usr/bin/ld`` then replace it with ``ld-new``. Alternatively, install; in ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` and use ``-fuse-ld=gold`` as described earlier. Optionally, add ``--enable-gold=default`` to the above configure invocation; to automatically install the newly built gold as the default linker with; ``make install``. * Build the LLVMgold plugin.

For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively. This file can be imported; by an OpenCL driver that support SPIR-V consumption or it can be compiled; further by offline SPIR-V consumer tools. Converting to SPIR-V produced with the optimization levels other than `-O0` is; currently available as an experimental feature and it is not guaranteed to work; in all cases. Clang also supports integrated generation of SPIR-V without use of ``llvm-spirv``; tool as an experimental feature when ``-fintegrated-objemitter`` flag is passed in; the command line. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -fintegrated-objemitter -c test.cl. Note that only very basic functionality is supported at this point and therefore; it is not suitable for arbitrary use cases.

This attribute; overrides ``no_sanitize(""thread"")``. Ignorelist; ----------. ThreadSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress data race reports; in the specified source files or functions. Unlike functions marked with; ``no_sanitize(""thread"")`` attribute, ignored functions are not instrumented; at all. This can lead to false positives due to missed synchronization via; atomic operations and missed stack frames in reports. Limitations; -----------. * ThreadSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. At the default; settings the memory overhead is 5x plus 1Mb per each thread. Settings with 3x; (less accurate analysis) and 9x (more accurate analysis) overhead are also; available.; * ThreadSanitizer maps (but does not reserve) a lot of virtual address space.; This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as usually expected.; * Libc/libstdc++ static linking is not supported.; * Non-position-independent executables are not supported. Therefore, the; ``fsanitize=thread`` flag will cause Clang to act as though the ``-fPIE``; flag had been supplied if compiling without ``-fPIC``, and as though the; ``-pie`` flag had been supplied if linking an executable. Current Status; --------------. ThreadSanitizer is in beta stage. It is known to work on large C++ programs; using pthreads, but we do not promise anything (yet).

Some downstream users track the order commits were made to subprojects; with some kind of ""umbrella"" project that imports the project git; mirrors as submodules, similar to the multirepo umbrella proposed; above. Such an umbrella repository looks something like this::. UM1 ---- UM2 -- UM3 -- UM4 ---- UM5 ---- UM6 ---- UM7 ---- UM8 <- main; | | | | | | |; Lllvm1 Llld1 Lclang1 Lclang2 Lllvm2 Llld2 Lmyproj1. The vertical bars represent submodule updates to a particular local; commit in the project mirror. ``UM3`` in this case is a commit of; some local umbrella repository state that is not a submodule update,; perhaps a ``README`` or project build script update. Commit ``UM8``; updates a submodule of local project ``myproj``. The tool ``zip-downstream-fork.py`` at; https://github.com/greened/llvm-git-migration/tree/zip can be used to; convert the umbrella history into a monorepo-based history with; commits in the order implied by submodule updates::.

Deployability,"kdir PATH_TO_MINIUT2_BUILD; cd PATH_TO_MINUIT2_BUILD; cmake PATH_TO_MINUIT2_SOURCE; cmake --build .; ```. Of course, GUIs, IDEs, etc. that work with [CMake] will work with this package. The standard method of CMake building, with a build directory inside the Minuit2 source directory and using the makefile generator, would look like:. ```bash; cd PATH_TO_MINUIT2_SOURCE; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; ```. The standard [CMake] variables, such as `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, work with Minuit2. There are two other options:. * `minuit2_mpi` activates the (outdated C++) MPI bindings.; * `minuit2_omp` activates OpenMP (make sure all FCNs are threadsafe). ## Testing. You can run `ctest` or `make test` to run the Minuit2 test suite. ## Installing or using in another package. You can install the package using `cmake --build --target install .` (or `make install` if directly using the make system), or you can use it from the build directory. You can also include it in another CMake project using `add_subdirectory()` and linking to the `Minuit2` target. Since this package also exports targets, `find_package(Minuit2)` will also work once this package is built or installed. (For the curious, CMake adds a config script to `~/.cmake/packages` when building or; `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/cmake/Modules` when installing a package that has export commands.). To repeat; using this in your own CMake project usually amounts to:. ```cmake; find_package(Minuit2); # OR; add_subdirectory(Minuit2). target_link_libraries(MyExeOrLib PUBLIC Minuit2::Minuit2); ```. You do not need to add include directories or anything else for Minuit2; the CMake target system handles all of this for you. ## Packaging. To build a binary package (add other generators with `-G`):; ```bash; make package; ```.

There no more; limitation, like with the options `para`and `candle`.; * Fix detection of errors that appears in nested TTreeFormula [ROOT-8218]; * Better basket size optimization by taking into account meta data and rounding up to next 512 bytes, ensuring a complete cluster fits into a single basket. ### Fast Cloning. We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address [ROOT-5078]. It can be controlled from the `TTreeCloner`, `TTree::CopyEntries` or `hadd` interfaces. The new cache is enabled by default, to update the size of the cache or disable it from `TTreeCloner` use: `TTreeCloner::SetCacheSize`. To do the same from `TTree::CopyEntries` add to the option string ""cachesize=SIZE"". To update the size of the cache or disable it from `hadd`, use the command line option `-cachesize SIZE`. `SIZE` shouyld be given in number bytes and can be expressed in 'human readable form' (number followed by size unit like MB, MiB, GB or GiB, etc. or SIZE can be set zero to disable the cache. ### Other Changes. * Update `TChain::LoadTree` so that the user call back routine is actually called for each input file even those containing `TTree` objects with no entries.; * Repair setting the branch address of a leaflist style branch taking directly the address of the struct. (Note that leaflist is nonetheless still deprecated and declaring the struct to the interpreter and passing the object directly to create the branch is much better).; * Provide an implicitly parallel implementation of `TTree::GetEntry`. The approach is based on creating a task per top-level branch in order to do the reading, unzipping and deserialisation in parallel.

We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable.

However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```.

Deployability,"l::has_value()` is true. We; want to show that when `x.value()` is executed, the flow condition implies; `x.has_value()`. In the example below `x.value()` is accessed safely because it is guarded by the; `x.has_value()` check. ```c++; void Example(std::optional<int> &x) {; if (x.has_value()) {; use(x.value());; }; }; ```. While entering the if branch we deduce that `x.has_value()` is implied by the; flow condition. ```c++; void Example(std::optional<int> x) {; // Flow condition: true.; if (x.has_value()) {; // Flow condition: x.has_value() == true.; use(x.value());; }; // Flow condition: true.; }; ```. We also need to prove that `x` is not modified between check and value access.; The modification of `x` may be very subtle:. ```c++; void F(std::optional<int> &x);. void Example(std::optional<int> &x) {; if (x.has_value()) {; // Flow condition: x.has_value() == true.; unknown_function(x); // may change x.; // Flow condition: true.; use(x.value());; }; }; ```. ## Example: finding dead code behind A/B experiment flags. Finding dead code is a classic application of data flow analysis. Unused flags for A/B experiment hide dead code. However, this flavor of dead; code is invisible to the compiler because the flag can be turned on at any; moment. We could make a tool that deletes experiment flags. The user tells us which flag; they want to delete, and we assume that the it's value is a given constant. For example, the user could use the tool to remove `example_flag` from this; code:. ```c++; DEFINE_FLAG(std::string, example_flag, """", ""A sample flag."");. void Example() {; bool x = GetFlag(FLAGS_example_flag).empty();; f();; if (x) {; g();; } else {; h();; }; }; ```. The tool would simplify the code to:. ```c++; void Example() {; f();; g();; }; ```. We can solve this problem with a classic constant propagation lattice combined; with symbolic evaluation. ## Example: finding inefficient usages of associative containers.

The legacy ```TLockGuard``` and ```R__LOCKGUARD``` use the write lock.; - Improved scaling of TROOT::RecursiveRemove in the case of large collection.; - Added a thread safe mode for the following ROOT collections: THashList, THashTable, TList and TObjArray. When ROOT's thread safe mode is enabled and the collection is set to use internal locks by calling:; ```; collection->UseRWLock();; ```; all operations on the collection will take the read or write lock when needed, currently they shared the global lock (ROOT::gCoreMutex). ### Interpreter. - cling's LLVM is upgraded to version 5.0; - All of cling's patches to llvm have been upstreamed.; - The interpreter-related lock is now locking only the compilation step, not the execution step.

In this use case, we'll be using CMake and Ninja, on a Debian-based Linux; system, cross-compiling from an x86_64 host (most Intel and AMD chips; nowadays) to a hard-float ARM target (most ARM targets nowadays). The packages you'll need are:. * ``cmake``; * ``ninja-build`` (from backports in Ubuntu); * ``gcc-4.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``gcc-4.7-multilib-arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``libgcc1-armhf-cross``; * ``libsfgcc1-armhf-cross``; * ``libstdc++6-armhf-cross``; * ``libstdc++6-4.7-dev-armhf-cross``. Configuring CMake; -----------------. For more information on how to configure CMake for LLVM/Clang,; see :doc:`CMake`. The CMake options you need to add are:. * ``-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=<target-system>``; * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir>``; * ``-DLLVM_HOST_TRIPLE=arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=ARM``. Note: ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` is always set automatically when ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is set. Don't put ``-DCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING=TRUE`` in your options. Also note that ``LLVM_HOST_TRIPLE`` specifies the triple of the system; that the cross built LLVM is going to run on - the flag is named based; on the autoconf build/host/target nomenclature. (This flag implicitly sets; other defaults, such as ``LLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE``.). If you're compiling with GCC, you can use architecture options for your target,; and the compiler driver will detect everything that it needs:. * ``-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a9 -mfloat-abi=hard'``. However, if you're using Clang, the driver might not be up-to-date with your; specific Linux distribution, version or GCC layout, so you'll need to fudge. In addition to the ones above, you'll also need:. * ``--target=arm-linux-gnueabihf`` or whatever is the triple",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileLLVM.rst:1351,install,install-dir,1351,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileLLVM.rst,1,['install'],['install-dir']
Deployability,"lang with PGO; =======================. If you prefer to not use the script or the cmake cache, this briefly goes over; how to build Clang/LLVM with PGO. First, you should have at least LLVM, Clang, and compiler-rt checked out; locally. Next, at a high level, you're going to need to do the following:. 1. Build a standard Release Clang and the relevant libclang_rt.profile library; 2. Build Clang using the Clang you built above, but with instrumentation; 3. Use the instrumented Clang to generate profiles, which consists of two steps:. - Running the instrumented Clang/LLVM/lld/etc. on tasks that represent how; users will use said tools.; - Using a tool to convert the ""raw"" profiles generated above into a single,; final PGO profile. 4. Build a final release Clang (along with whatever other binaries you need); using the profile collected from your benchmark. In more detailed steps:. 1. Configure a Clang build as you normally would. It's highly recommended that; you use the Release configuration for this, since it will be used to build; another Clang. Because you need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. In this build directory, you simply need to build the ``clang`` target (and; whatever supporting tooling your benchmark requires). 3. As mentioned above, this has two steps: gathering profile data, and then; massaging it into a useful form:. a. Build your benchmark using the Clang generated in step 2.

Assembling a Toolchain:; =======================. The procedure is:. # Build an LLVM toolchain with support for Windows Itanium.; # Use the toolchain from step 1. to build libc++, libc++abi, and libunwind. It is also possible to cross-compile from Linux. One method of building the libraries in step 2. is to build them ""stand-alone"".; A stand-alone build doesn't involve the rest of the LLVM tree. The steps are:. * ``cd build-dir``; * ``cmake -DLLVM_PATH=<path to llvm checkout e.g. /llvm-project/> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install path> <other options> <path to project e.g. /llvm-project/libcxxabi>``; * ``<make program e.g. ninja>``; * ``<make program> install``. More information on standalone builds can be found in the build documentation for; the respective libraries. The next section discuss the salient options and modifications; required for building and installing the libraries using standalone builds. This assumes; that we are building libunwind and ibc++ as DLLs and statically linking libc++abi into; libc++. Other build configurations are possible, but they are not discussed here. Common CMake configuration options:; -----------------------------------. * ``-D_LIBCPP_ABI_FORCE_ITANIUM'``. Tell the libc++ headers that the Itanium C++ ABI is being used. * ``-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-lmsvcrt -llegacy_stdio_definitions -D_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE""``. Supply CRT definitions including stdio definitions that have been removed from the MS VS CRT.; We don't want the stdio functions declared inline as they will cause multiple definition; errors when the same symbols are pulled in from legacy_stdio_definitions.ib. * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWindowsItaniumPrograms.rst:3629,install,install,3629,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWindowsItaniumPrograms.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWindowsItaniumPrograms.rst,1,['install'],['install']
Deployability,"lated; predicate are in different functions. In essence, we need some interprocedural; generalization of the predicate state tracking. A primary challenge to passing; the predicate state between functions is that we would like to not require a; change to the ABI or calling convention in order to make this mitigation more; deployable, and further would like code mitigated in this way to be easily; mixed with code not mitigated in this way and without completely losing the; value of the mitigation. ##### Embed the predicate state into the high bit(s) of the stack pointer. We can use the same technique that allows hardening pointers to pass the; predicate state into and out of functions. The stack pointer is trivially; passed between functions and we can test for it having the high bits set to; detect when it has been marked due to misspeculation. The callsite instruction; sequence looks like (assuming a misspeculated state value of `-1`):; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shlq $47, %rax; orq %rax, %rsp; callq other_function; movq %rsp, %rax; sarq 63, %rax # Sign extend the high bit to all bits.; ```. This first puts the predicate state into the high bits of `%rsp` before calling; the function and then reads it back out of high bits of `%rsp` afterward. When; correctly executing (speculatively or not), these are all no-ops. When; misspeculating, the stack pointer will end up negative. We arrange for it to; remain a canonical address, but otherwise leave the low bits alone to allow; stack adjustments to proceed normally without disrupting this. Within the; called function, we can extract this predicate state and then reset it on; return:; ```; other_function:; # prolog; callq other_function; movq %rsp, %rax; sarq 63, %rax # Sign extend the high bit to all bits.; # ... .LBB0_N:; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shlq $47, %rax; orq %rax, %rsp; retq; ```.

The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run.

Deployability,"le do; the right thing most of the time, and only commit patches without pre-commit; review when they are confident they are right. The trick to this is that the project has to guarantee that all patches that are; committed are reviewed after they go in: you don't want everyone to assume; someone else will review it, allowing the patch to go unreviewed. To solve this; problem, we have a notion of an 'owner' for a piece of the code. The sole; responsibility of a code owner is to ensure that a commit to their area of the; code is appropriately reviewed, either by themself or by someone else. The list; of current code owners can be found in the file `CODE_OWNERS.TXT; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/CODE_OWNERS.TXT>`_ in the; root of the LLVM source tree. Note that code ownership is completely different than reviewers: anyone can; review a piece of code, and we welcome code review from anyone who is; interested. Code owners are the ""last line of defense"" to guarantee that all; patches that are committed are actually reviewed. Being a code owner is a somewhat unglamorous position, but it is incredibly; important for the ongoing success of the project. Because people get busy,; interests change, and unexpected things happen, code ownership is purely opt-in,; and anyone can choose to resign their ""title"" at any time. For now, we do not; have an official policy on how one gets elected to be a code owner. .. _include a testcase:. Test Cases; ----------.

Please address the feedback and re-post an; updated version of your patch. This cycle continues until all requests and comments; have been addressed and a reviewer accepts the patch with a `Looks good to me` or `LGTM`.; Once that is done the change can be committed. If you do not have commit; access, please let people know during the review and someone should commit it; on your behalf.

So, using modules would be a big win when scaling.; In a simpler word, we could get rid of many redundant compilations by using modules. Roughly, this theory is correct. But the problem is that it is too rough.; The behavior depends on the optimization level, as we will illustrate below. First is ``O0``. The compilation process is described in the following graph. .. code-block:: none. ├-------------frontend----------┼-------------middle end----------------┼----backend----┤; │ │ │ │; └---parsing----sema----codegen--┴----- transformations ---- codegen ----┴---- codegen --┘. ┌---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┐; | │; | source file │; | │; └---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┘. ┌--------┐; │ │; │imported│; │ │; │ code │; │ │; └--------┘. Here we can see that the source file (could be a non-module unit or a module unit) would get processed by the; whole pipeline.; But the imported code would only get involved in semantic analysis, which is mainly about name lookup,; overload resolution and template instantiation.; All of these processes are fast relative to the whole compilation process.; More importantly, the imported code only needs to be processed once in frontend code generation,; as well as the whole middle end and backend.; So we could get a big win for the compilation time in O0. But with optimizations, things are different:. (we omit ``code generation`` part for each end due to the limited space). .. code-block:: none. ├-------- frontend ---------┼--------------- middle end --------------------┼------ backend ----┤; │ │ │ │; └--- parsing ---- sema -----┴--- optimizations --- IPO ---- optimizations---┴--- optimizations -┘. ┌-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┐; │ │; │ source file │; │ │; └---------------------------",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:40945,pipeline,pipeline,40945,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up; long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines; ending in ``\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in; ``\`` is found.

Some important things to remember about fuzz targets:. * The fuzzing engine will execute the fuzz target many times with different inputs in the same process.; * It must tolerate any kind of input (empty, huge, malformed, etc).; * It must not `exit()` on any input.; * It may use threads but ideally all threads should be joined at the end of the function.; * It must be as deterministic as possible. Non-determinism (e.g. random decisions not based on the input bytes) will make fuzzing inefficient.; * It must be fast. Try avoiding cubic or greater complexity, logging, or excessive memory consumption.; * Ideally, it should not modify any global state (although that's not strict).; * Usually, the narrower the target the better. E.g. if your target can parse several data formats, split it into several targets, one per format. Fuzzer Usage; ------------. Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary. In order to build your fuzzer binary, use the `-fsanitize=fuzzer` flag during the; compilation and linking. In most cases you may want to combine libFuzzer with; AddressSanitizer_ (ASAN), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer_ (UBSAN), or both. You can; also build with MemorySanitizer_ (MSAN), but support is experimental::. clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target w/o sanitizers; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,address mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with ASAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,signed-integer-overflow mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with a part of UBSAN; clang -g -O1 -fsanitize=fuzzer,memory mytarget.c # Builds the fuzz target with MSAN. This will perform the necessary instrumentation, as well as linking with the libFuzzer library.; Note that ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` links in the libFuzzer's ``main()`` symbol.

Deployability,"level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines. Different tools have; different ways of loading dynamic pass plugins. For example, ``opt; -load-pass-plugin=path/to/plugin.so`` loads a pass plugin into ``opt``. For; information on writing a pass plugin, see :doc:`WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass`. Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:6327,pipeline,pipeline,6327,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

To run the script on a specific release candidate run::. ./test-release.sh \; -release 3.3 \; -rc 1 \; -no-64bit \; -test-asserts \; -no-compare-files. Each system will require different options. For instance, x86_64 will; obviously not need ``-no-64bit`` while 32-bit systems will, or the script will; fail. The important flags to get right are:. * On the pre-release, you should change ``-rc 1`` to ``-final``. On RC2,; change it to ``-rc 2`` and so on. * On non-release testing, you can use ``-final`` in conjunction with; ``-no-checkout``, but you'll have to create the ``final`` directory by hand; and link the correct source dir to ``final/llvm.src``. * For release candidates, you need ``-test-asserts``, or it won't create a; ""Release+Asserts"" directory, which is needed for release testing and; benchmarking. This will take twice as long. * On the final candidate you just need Release builds, and that's the binary; directory you'll have to pack. * On macOS, you must export ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9`` before running; the script.

ACLiC executes two steps and a third one if needed. These are:. - Calling `rootcling` to create a dictionary using `rootcling`.; - Calling the compiler to build the shared library from the script.; - If there are errors, it calls the compiler to build a dummy; executable to clearly report unresolved symbols. ACLiC makes a shared library with a dictionary containing the; classes and functions declared in the script. It also adds the; classes and functions declared in included files with the same name; as the script file and any of the following extensions: `.h`, `.hh`,; `.hpp`, `.hxx`, `.hPP`, `.hXX`. This means that, by default, you; cannot combine scripts from different files into one library by using; `#include` statements; you will need to compile each script; separately. In a future release, we plan to add the global variables; declared in the script to the dictionary also. If you are curious; about the specific calls, you can raise the ROOT debug level: gDebug=3; and ACLiC will print these steps. If you need to keep the intermediate; files around, for example when debugging the script using gdb, use; gDebug=7. ### Moving between Interpreter and Compiler. The best way to develop portable scripts is to make sure you can; always run them with both, the interpreter and with ACLiC. To do so,; do not use the Cling extensions and program around the Cling; limitations. When it is not possible or desirable to program around; the Cling limitations, you can use the C preprocessor symbols defined; for Cling and `rootcling`. The preprocessor symbol `__CLING__` is defined for both ROOT and; `rootcling`. The symbol `__ROOTCLING__` (and `__MAKECINT__` for backward; compatibility) is only defined in `rootcling`.

It is not an error if either of these files is not found. The configuration file consists of command-line options specified on one or; more lines. Lines composed of whitespace characters only are ignored as well as; lines in which the first non-blank character is ``#``. Long options may be split; between several lines by a trailing backslash. Here is example of a; configuration file:. ::. # Several options on line; -c --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. # Long option split between lines; -I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/../../../../\; include/c++/5.4.0. # other config files may be included; @linux.options. Files included by ``@file`` directives in configuration files are resolved; relative to the including file. For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file. In cases where a configuration file is deployed alongside SDK contents, the; SDK directory can remain fully portable by using ``<CFGDIR>`` prefixed paths.; In this way, the user may only need to specify a root configuration file with; ``--config=`` to establish every aspect of the SDK with the compiler:. ::. --target=foo; -isystem <CFGDIR>/include; -L <CFGDIR>/lib; -T <CFGDIR>/ldscripts/link.ld.

The; normal constructor generated a big slow down when creating a Palette with; `CreateGradientColorTable`.; * In `CreateGradientColorTable` we do not need anymore to compute the highest; color index.; * In `TGraphPainter`, when graphs are painted with lines, they are split into; chunks of length `fgMaxPointsPerLine`. This allows to paint line with an ""infinite""; number of points. In some case this ""chunks painting"" technic may create artefacts; at the chunk's boundaries.

This option is equivalent to the one in; `THStack`. It allows to draw all the `TGraphs` in separated pads. ### THStack. - By default the background of the histograms is erased before drawing the; histograms. The new option `noclear` avoid this behaviour. This is useful; when drawing a `THStack` on top of an other plot. If the patterns used to; draw the histograms in the stack are transparents, then the plot behind; will be visible. ### TH2Poly. - Implement a simple version of ""Scale"". ### TF1. - Change `TF1::Integral(double a, double b, double * params = 0, double eps = 1.E-12)` to; `TF1::Integral(doubnle a, double b, double epsrel=1.E-12)`. One should use `TF1::SetParameters` to; set the function parameters before computing the integral. - Add a new function `TF1::IntegralOneDim(Double_t a, Double_t b, Double_t epsrel, Double_t epsabs, Double_t &err)`; that returns as last argument the error in the integration. `TF1::Integral` is implemented using `Tf1::IntegralOneDim`. - The one-dim and multi-dim integral functions are now implemented using the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim`; classes. This allows to change the integration algorithm used in `TF1` using the static methods of the classes; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDimOptions` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions`.

The location of the arguments are not normally recorded in the stack; map because they are already fixed by the calling convention. The; remaining ``live values`` will have their location recorded, which; could be a register, stack location, or constant. A special calling; convention has been introduced for use with stack maps, anyregcc,; which forces the arguments to be loaded into registers but allows; those register to be dynamically allocated. These argument registers; will have their register locations recorded in the stack map in; addition to the remaining ``live values``. The patch point also emits nops to cover at least ``<numBytes>`` of; instruction encoding space. Hence, the client must ensure that; ``<numBytes>`` is enough to encode a call to the target address on the; supported targets.

Deployability,"lls is really just an; application of the existing C/C++ rule about calling functions through an; incompatible function type, but it's useful to state it explicitly. .. _arc.object.operands.retained-return-values:. Retained return values; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A function or method which returns a retainable object pointer type may be; marked as returning a retained value, signifying that the caller expects to take; ownership of a +1 retain count. This is done by adding the; ``ns_returns_retained`` attribute to the function or method declaration, like; so:. .. code-block:: objc. id foo(void) __attribute((ns_returns_retained));; - (id) foo __attribute((ns_returns_retained));. This attribute is part of the type of the function or method. When returning from such a function or method, ARC retains the value at the; point of evaluation of the return statement, before leaving all local scopes. When receiving a return result from such a function or method, ARC releases the; value at the end of the full-expression it is contained within, subject to the; usual optimizations for local values. .. admonition:: Rationale. This formalizes direct transfers of ownership from a callee to a caller. The; most common scenario this models is the retained return from ``init``,; ``alloc``, ``new``, and ``copy`` methods, but there are other cases in the; frameworks. After optimization there are typically no extra retains and; releases required. Methods in the ``alloc``, ``copy``, ``init``, ``mutableCopy``, and ``new``; :ref:`families <arc.method-families>` are implicitly marked; ``__attribute__((ns_returns_retained))``. This may be suppressed by explicitly; marking the method ``__attribute__((ns_returns_not_retained))``. It is undefined behavior if the method to which an Objective-C message send; statically resolves has different retain semantics on its result from the; method it dynamically resolves to. It is undefined behavior if a block or; function call is made through a static type wi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:19817,release,releases,19817,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['release'],['releases']

DESCRIPTION; -----------. The :program:`llvm-ar` command is similar to the common Unix utility,; :program:`ar`. It archives several files, such as objects and LLVM bitcode; files into a single archive library that can be linked into a program. However,; the archive can contain any kind of file. By default, :program:`llvm-ar`; generates a symbol table that makes linking faster because only the symbol; table needs to be consulted, not each individual file member of the archive. The :program:`llvm-ar` command can be used to *read* archive files in SVR4, GNU,; BSD , Big Archive, and Darwin format, and *write* in the GNU, BSD, Big Archive, and; Darwin style archive files. If an SVR4 format archive is used with the :option:`r`; (replace), :option:`d` (delete), :option:`m` (move) or :option:`q`; (quick update) operations, the archive will be reconstructed in the format; defined by :option:`--format`. Here's where :program:`llvm-ar` departs from previous :program:`ar`; implementations:. *The following option is not supported*. [f] - truncate inserted filenames. *The following options are ignored for compatibility*. --plugin=<string> - load a plugin which adds support for other file formats. [l] - ignored in :program:`ar`. *Symbol Table*. Since :program:`llvm-ar` supports bitcode files, the symbol table it creates; includes both native and bitcode symbols. *Deterministic Archives*. By default, :program:`llvm-ar` always uses zero for timestamps and UIDs/GIDs; to write archives in a deterministic mode. This is equivalent to the; :option:`D` modifier being enabled by default.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. The :program:`llvm-bcanalyzer` command is a small utility for analyzing bitcode; files. The tool reads a bitcode file (such as generated with the; :program:`llvm-as` tool) and produces a statistical report on the contents of; the bitcode file. The tool can also dump a low level but human readable; version of the bitcode file. This tool is probably not of much interest or; utility except for those working directly with the bitcode file format. Most; LLVM users can just ignore this tool. If *filename* is omitted or is ``-``, then :program:`llvm-bcanalyzer` reads its; input from standard input. This is useful for combining the tool into a; pipeline. Output is written to the standard output. OPTIONS; -------. .. program:: llvm-bcanalyzer. .. option:: --dump. Causes :program:`llvm-bcanalyzer` to dump the bitcode in a human readable; format. This format is significantly different from LLVM assembly and; provides details about the encoding of the bitcode file. .. option:: --help. Print a summary of command line options.

Deployability,"llvm-install-name-tool - LLVM tool for manipulating install-names and rpaths; ============================================================================. .. program:: llvm-install-name-tool. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-install-name-tool` [*options*] *input*. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-install-name-tool` is a tool to manipulate dynamic shared library; install names and rpaths listed in a Mach-O binary. For most scenarios, it works as a drop-in replacement for Apple's; :program:`install_name_tool`. OPTIONS; --------; At least one of the following options are required, and some options can be; combined with other options. Options :option:`-add_rpath`, :option:`-delete_rpath`,; and :option:`-rpath` can be combined in an invocation only if they do not share; the same `<rpath>` value. .. option:: -add_rpath <rpath>. Add an rpath named ``<rpath>`` to the specified binary. Can be specified multiple; times to add multiple rpaths. Throws an error if ``<rpath>`` is already listed in; the binary. .. option:: -change <old_install_name> <new_install_name>. Change an install name ``<old_install_name>`` to ``<new_install_name>`` in the; specified binary. Can be specified multiple times to change multiple dependent shared; library install names. Option is ignored if ``<old_install_name>`` is not listed; in the specified binary. .. option:: -delete_rpath <rpath>. Delete an rpath named ``<rpath>`` from the specified binary. Can be specified multiple; times to delete multiple rpaths. Throws an error if ``<rpath>`` is not listed in; the binary. .. option:: -delete_all_rpaths. Deletes all rpaths from the binary. .. option:: --help, -h. Print a summary of command line options. .. option:: -id <name>. Change shared library's identification name under LC_ID_DYLIB to ``<name>`` in the; specified binary. If specified multiple times, only the last :option:`-id` option is; selected. Option is ignored if the specified Mach-O binary is not a dynamic shared library. .. option",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-install-name-tool.rst:5,install,install-name-tool,5,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-install-name-tool.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-install-name-tool.rst,6,['install'],"['install', 'install-name-tool', 'install-names']"

The Virtual Analysis Facility client is available on; [GitHub](https://github.com/dberzano/virtual-analysis-facility):. ``` {.bash}; git clone git://github.com/dberzano/virtual-analysis-facility.git /dest/dir; ```. The client will be found in `/dest/dir/client/bin/vaf-enter`: it is; convenient to add it to the `$PATH` so that the users might simply start; it by typing `vaf-enter`. ### Install the experiment's configuration files system-wide. A system administrator might find convenient to install the experiment; environment scripts system-wide. Configuration scripts for LHC experiments are shipped with the VAF; client and can be found in; `/dest/dir/client/config-samples/<experiment_name>`. To make them used; by default by the VAF client, place them in the `/dest/dir/etc`; directory like this:. ``` {.bash}; rsync -a /dest/dir/client/config-samples/<experiment_name>/ /dest/dir/etc/; ```.

Deployability,"logic is; defined by *test suites*. TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded. Config files; themselves are Python modules which will be executed. When the config file is; executed, two important global variables are predefined:. **lit_config**. The global **lit** configuration object (a *LitConfig* instance), which defines; the builtin test formats, global configuration parameters, and other helper; routines for implementing test configurations. **config**. This is the config object (a *TestingConfig* instance) for the test suite,; which the config file is expected to populate. The following variables are also; available on the *config* object, some of which must be set by the config and; others are optional or predefined:. **name** *[required]* The name of the test suite, for use in reports and; diagnostics. **test_format** *[required]* The test format object which will be used to; discover and run tests in the test suite. Generally this will be a builtin test; format available from the *lit.formats* module. **test_source_root** The filesystem path to the test suite root. For out-of-dir; builds this is the directory that will be scanned for tests. **test_exec_root** For out-of-dir builds, the path to the test suite root inside; the object directory.

The most interesting part of this is that we ignore top-level; semicolons. Why is this, you ask? The basic reason is that if you type; ""4 + 5"" at the command line, the parser doesn't know whether that is the; end of what you will type or not. For example, on the next line you; could type ""def foo..."" in which case 4+5 is the end of a top-level; expression. Alternatively you could type ""\* 6"", which would continue; the expression. Having top-level semicolons allows you to type ""4+5;"",; and the parser will know you are done. Conclusions; ===========. With just under 400 lines of commented code (240 lines of non-comment,; non-blank code), we fully defined our minimal language, including a; lexer, parser, and AST builder. With this done, the executable will; validate Kaleidoscope code and tell us if it is grammatically invalid.; For example, here is a sample interaction:. .. code-block:: bash. $ ./a.out; ready> def foo(x y) x+foo(y, 4.0);; Parsed a function definition.; ready> def foo(x y) x+y y;; Parsed a function definition.; Parsed a top-level expr; ready> def foo(x y) x+y );; Parsed a function definition.; Error: unknown token when expecting an expression; ready> extern sin(a);; ready> Parsed an extern; ready> ^D; $. There is a lot of room for extension here. You can define new AST nodes,; extend the language in many ways, etc. In the `next; installment <LangImpl03.html>`_, we will describe how to generate LLVM; Intermediate Representation (IR) from the AST.

Post-commit errors; ------------------. Once your change is submitted it will be picked up by automated build; bots that will build and test your patch in a variety of configurations. You can see all configurations and their current state in a waterfall; view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/waterfall. The waterfall view is good; to get a general overview over the tested configurations and to see; which configuration have been broken for a while. The console view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/console helps to get a; better understanding of the build results of a specific patch. If you; want to follow along how your change is affecting the build bots, **this; should be the first place to look at** - the colored bubbles correspond; to projects in the waterfall. If you see a broken build, do not despair - some build bots are; continuously broken; if your change broke the build, you will see a red; bubble in the console view, while an already broken build will show an; orange bubble. Of course, even when the build was already broken, a new; change might introduce a hidden new failure. | When you want to see more details how a specific build is broken,; click the red bubble.; | If post-commit error logs confuse you, do not worry too much -; everybody on the project is aware that this is a bit unwieldy, so; expect people to jump in and help you understand what's going on!. buildbots, overview of bots, getting error logs.

Deployability,"ls have evolved over the last several decades; from basic syntactic checkers to those that find deep bugs by reasoning about; the semantics of code. The goal of the Clang Static Analyzer is to provide a; industrial-quality static analysis framework for analyzing C, C++, and; Objective-C programs that is freely available, extensible, and has a high quality of implementation.; Part of Clang and LLVM; As its name implies, the Clang Static Analyzer is built on top of Clang and LLVM.; Strictly speaking, the analyzer is part of Clang, as Clang consists of a set of; reusable C++ libraries for building powerful source-level tools. The static; analysis engine used by the Clang Static Analyzer is a Clang library, and has; the capability to be reused in different contexts and by different clients.; Important Points to Consider; While we believe that the static analyzer is already very useful for finding; bugs, we ask you to bear in mind a few points when using it.; Work-in-Progress; The analyzer is a continuous work-in-progress. There are many planned; enhancements to improve both the precision and scope of its analysis algorithms; as well as the kinds of bugs it will find. While there are fundamental; limitations to what static analysis can do, we have a long way to go before; hitting that wall.; Slower than Compilation; Operationally, using static analysis to; automatically find deep program bugs is about trading CPU time for the hardening; of code. Because of the deep analysis performed by state-of-the-art static; analysis tools, static analysis can be much slower than compilation.; While the Clang Static Analyzer is being designed to be as fast and; light-weight as possible, please do not expect it to be as fast as compiling a; program (even with optimizations enabled). Some of the algorithms needed to find; bugs require in the worst case exponential time.; The Clang Static Analyzer runs in a reasonable amount of time by both; bounding the amount of checking work it will d",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/index.html:2380,continuous,continuous,2380,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/index.html,2,['continuous'],['continuous']

A brief step-by-step procedure to install CernVM-FS is hereby described. - Download and install the latest stable version from; [here](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem): pick one which is; appropriate to your operating system. You need the `cvmfs` package,; you *don't* need the `cvmfs-devel` or `cvmfs-server` ones. - As root user, run:. # cvmfs_config setup. - Start the `autofs` service: how to to this depends on your operating; system. On Ubuntu using Upstart:. # restart autofs. On RHEL-based or older Ubuntus:. # service autofs restart. - Prepare a `/etc/cvmfs/default.local` file (create it if it does not; exists) with the following configuration bits:. ``` {.bash}; CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy-server.domain.ch:3128,DIRECT; CVMFS_REPOSITORIES=your-experiment.cern.ch,sft.cern.ch; CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=50000; ```. You need to properly specify your closest HTTP caching proxy:; separate many of them via commas. The last fallback value, `DIRECT`,; tells cvmfs to connect directly without using any proxy at all. Among the list of repositories (comma-separated), always specify; `sft.cern.ch` and the one containing the software to your experiment; (e.g., `cms.cern.ch`). The quota limit is, in Megabytes, the amount of local disk space to; use as cache. - Check the configuration and repositories with:. # cvmfs_config chksetup; OK; # cvmfs_config probe; Probing /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch... OK; Probing /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch... OK. > You might need special configurations for some custom software; > repositories! Special cases are not covered in this guide. ### Firewall configuration.

ARC may not allow a retainable object ``X`` to be deallocated at a; time ``T`` in a computation history if:. * ``X`` is the value stored in a ``__strong`` object ``S`` with; :ref:`precise lifetime semantics <arc.optimization.precise>`, or. * ``X`` is the value stored in a ``__strong`` object ``S`` with; imprecise lifetime semantics and, at some point after ``T`` but; before the next store to ``S``, the computation history features a; load from ``S`` and in some way depends on the value loaded, or. * ``X`` is a value described as being released at the end of the; current full-expression and, at some point after ``T`` but before; the end of the full-expression, the computation history depends; on that value. .. admonition:: Rationale. The intent of the second rule is to say that objects held in normal; ``__strong`` local variables may be released as soon as the value in; the variable is no longer being used: either the variable stops; being used completely or a new value is stored in the variable. The intent of the third rule is to say that return values may be; released after they've been used. A computation history depends on a pointer value ``P`` if it:. * performs a pointer comparison with ``P``,; * loads from ``P``,; * stores to ``P``,; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` derived via pointer arithmetic; from ``P`` (including an instance-variable or field access), or; * depends on a pointer value ``Q`` loaded from ``P``.

Deployability,"lved the race conditions inherent to the use of the RecursiveRemove mechanism. - Introduced ```ROOT::TReentrantRWLock```, an implementation of a reentrant read-write lock with a configurable internal mutex/lock and a condition variable to synchronize readers and writers when necessary. The implementation allows a single reader to take the write lock without releasing the reader lock. It also allows the writer to take a read lock. In other word, the lock is re-entrant for both reading and writing. The implementation tries to make faster the scenario when readers come and go but there is no writer. In that case, readers will not pay the price of taking the internal lock.; Moreover, this RW lock tries to be fair with writers, giving them the possibility to claim the lock and wait for only the remaining readers, thus preventing starvation. - Switched the ROOT global to be a ```ROOT::TReentrantRWLock``` and renamed it ROOT::gCoreMutex. The old name ```gROOTMutex``` and ```gInterpreterMutex``` are deprecated and may be removed in future releases.; - Added ```TReadLockGuard```,```TWriteLockGuard```, ```R__READ_LOCKGUARD``` and```R__WRITE_LOCKGUARD``` to take advantage of the new lock. The legacy ```TLockGuard``` and ```R__LOCKGUARD``` use the write lock.; - Improved scaling of TROOT::RecursiveRemove in the case of large collection.; - Added a thread safe mode for the following ROOT collections: THashList, THashTable, TList and TObjArray. When ROOT's thread safe mode is enabled and the collection is set to use internal locks by calling:; ```; collection->UseRWLock();; ```; all operations on the collection will take the read or write lock when needed, currently they shared the global lock (ROOT::gCoreMutex). ### Interpreter. - cling's LLVM is upgraded to version 5.0; - All of cling's patches to llvm have been upstreamed.; - The interpreter-related lock is now locking only the compilation step, not the execution step.

The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up; long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines; ending in ``\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in; ``\`` is found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one; execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the pipeline; to be executed. If any process in the pipeline fails, the entire line (and; test case) fails too. Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a ``.ll`` file:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llvm-dis > %t1; ; RUN: llvm-dis < %s.bc-13 > %t2; ; RUN: diff %t1 %t2. As with a Unix shell, the RUN lines permit pipelines and I/O; redirection to be used. There are some quoting rules that you must pay attention to when writing; your RUN lines. In general nothing needs to be quoted. :program:`lit` won't; strip off any quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value.

Not respecting this rule generally leads; to unpredictable results. Therefore `A` and `B` together must fit into; `C` that has to fit also into `D`, `E`, and `F`. This is not always; straightforward to accomplish, especially when instead of `A` and `B` we; have many more volumes. In order to avoid these problems, one can use for the difficult cases; the class TGeoVolumeAssembly, representing an assembly of volumes.; This behaves like a normal container volume supporting other volumes; positioned inside, but it has neither shape nor medium. It cannot be; used directly as a piece of the geometry, but just as a temporary; structure helping temporary assembling and positioning volumes. If we define now `C` as an assembly containing `A` and `B`, positioning; the assembly into `D,E` and `F` will actually position only `A` and; `B `directly into these volumes, taking into account their combined; transformations `A/B` to `C` and `C` to `D/E/F`.

Of course, we managed to get rid of; the ""unnecessary"" volume `C` in our geometry, but we end-up with a more; flat structure for `D,E` and `F` (more daughters inside).

Especially given the; global nature of our community, this waiting time should be at least 24 hours.; Please also be mindful of weekends and major holidays. Our goal is to ensure community consensus around design decisions and; significant implementation choices, and one responsibility of a reviewer, when; providing an overall approval for a patch, is to be reasonably sure that such; consensus exists. If you're not familiar enough with the community to know,; then you shouldn't be providing final approval to commit. A reviewer providing; final approval should have commit access to the LLVM project. Every patch should be reviewed by at least one technical expert in the areas of; the project affected by the change. Splitting Requests and Conditional Acceptance; ---------------------------------------------. Reviewers may request certain aspects of a patch to be broken out into separate; patches for independent review. Reviewers may also accept a patch; conditioned on the author providing a follow-up patch addressing some; particular issue or concern (although no committed patch should leave the; project in a broken state). Moreover, reviewers can accept a patch conditioned on; the author applying some set of minor updates prior to committing, and when; applicable, it is polite for reviewers to do so. Don't Unintentionally Block a Review; ------------------------------------. If you review a patch, but don't intend for the review process to block on your; approval, please state that explicitly. Out of courtesy, we generally wait on; committing a patch until all reviewers are satisfied, and if you don't intend; to look at the patch again in a timely fashion, please communicate that fact in; the review.

This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice. The upside is that the clang driver is more efficient and does little; extra work to support universal builds. It also provides better error; reporting and UI consistency. - **Specs**. The clang driver has no direct correspondent for ""specs"". The; majority of the functionality that is embedded in specs is in the; Tool specific argument translation routines. The parts of specs which; control the compilation pipeline are generally part of the *Pipeline*; stage. - **Toolchains**. The gcc driver has no direct understanding of tool chains. Each gcc; binary roughly corresponds to the information which is embedded; inside a single ToolChain. The clang driver is intended to be portable and support complex; compilation environments. All platform and tool chain specific code; should be protected behind either abstract or well defined interfaces; (such as whether the platform supports use as a driver driver).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:16235,pipeline,pipeline,16235,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Please refer to CMake's release notes for further; information. The method to select the C++ standard has changed. Now the recommended way; to select the C++ standard is via the option `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=XX`, which; is the idiomatic way to do it in CMake. The old options still work, but have; been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Build option descriptions have been updated to indicate which builtins require; an active network connection during the build. You can inspect the list of; options and their descriptions by running `cmake -LH $PWD` in the build; directory. The build system has been updated to remove most file globbing to improve; the reliability of incremental builds when source files are added or removed. A new check has been added to make ROOT fail during the configuration step; if incompatible versions of the Python interpreter and its libraries are; selected. The `all=ON` option now tries to enable more options. Some options had their; default value toggled to disabled, which affected `all=ON`. Now all options; are listed explicitly so that they are enabled regardless of their default; value. ### Builtins.

Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to; Procedure-Oriented Programming:. - Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity; for reuse. - Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify; objects. - Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide; a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the; relationships among them. - Complexity is reduced because there is little growth of the global; state, the state is contained within each object, rather than; scattered through the program in the form of global variables. - Objects may come and go, but the basic structure of the program; remains relatively static, increases opportunity for reuse of; design. ## Installing ROOT; \index{install ROOT}. To install ROOT you have the choice to; download the binaries or the source. The source is quicker to transfer; since it is only \~22 MB, but you will need to compile and link it. The; binaries compiled with no debug information range from \~35 MB to \~45; MB depending on the target platform. The installation and building of ROOT is described in Appendix A:; Install and Build ROOT. You can download the binaries, or the source.; The GNU g++ compiler on most UNIX platforms can compile ROOT. Before downloading a binary version make sure your machine contains the; right run-time environment. In most cases it is not possible to run a; version compiled with, e.g., gcc4.0 on a platform where only gcc 3.2 is; installed. In such cases you'll have to install ROOT from source. ROOT is currently running on the following platforms: supported; platforms. - `GNU/Linux x86-32 (IA32) and x86-64 (AMD64)(GCC,Intel/icc,; Portland/PGCC,KAI/KCC)`. - `Intel Itanium (IA64) GNU/Linux (GCC, Intel/ecc, SGI/CC) `. - `FreeBSD and OpenBSD (GCC)`. - `GN",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:8797,install,install,8797,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['install'],['install']

As a first step, this means we'll disable vectorization (LoopVectorize/SLP); entirely when the a function has either of the ``aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled``,; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_body`` or ``aarch64_pstate_sm_compatible`` attributes,; in order to avoid the use of vector instructions. Later on we'll aim to relax these restrictions to enable scalable; auto-vectorization with a subset of streaming-compatible instructions, but that; requires changes to the CostModel, Legalization and SelectionDAG lowering. We will also emit diagnostics in Clang to prevent the use of; non-streaming(-compatible) operations, e.g. through ACLE intrinsics, when a; function is decorated with the streaming mode attributes. Other things to consider; ------------------------. * Inlining must be disabled when the call-site needs to toggle PSTATE.SM or; when the callee's function body is executed in a different streaming mode than; its caller. This is needed because function calls are the boundaries for; streaming mode changes. * Tail call optimization must be disabled when the call-site needs to toggle; PSTATE.SM, such that the caller can restore the original value of PSTATE.SM. 3. Handling PSTATE.ZA; =====================. In contrast to PSTATE.SM, enabling PSTATE.ZA does not affect the SVE vector; length and also doesn't clobber FP/AdvSIMD/SVE registers. This means it is safe; to toggle PSTATE.ZA using intrinsics. This also makes it simpler to setup a; lazy-save mechanism for calls to private-ZA functions (i.e. functions that may; either directly or indirectly clobber ZA state). For the purpose of handling functions marked with ``aarch64_pstate_za_new``,; we have introduced a new LLVM IR pass (SMEABIPass) that is run just before; SelectionDAG.

Deployability,"memory using the corresponding ``LDR`` instruction. On a little-endian system this means that element 0 will always contain the lowest addressed element of a short vector; on a big-endian system element 0 will contain the highest-addressed element of a short vector. -- Procedure Call Standard for the ARM 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), 4.1.2 Short Vectors. The use of ``LDR`` and ``STR`` as the ABI defines has at least one advantage over ``LD1`` and ``ST1``. ``LDR`` and ``STR`` are oblivious to the size of the individual lanes of a vector. ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` are not - the lane size is encoded within them. This is important across an ABI boundary, because it would become necessary to know the lane width the callee expects. Consider the following code:. .. code-block:: c. <callee.c>; void callee(uint32x2_t v) {; ...; }. <caller.c>; extern void callee(uint32x2_t);; void caller() {; callee(...);; }. If ``callee`` changed its signature to ``uint16x4_t``, which is equivalent in register content, if we passed as ``LD1`` we'd break this code until ``caller`` was updated and recompiled. There is an argument that if the signatures of the two functions are different then the behaviour should be undefined. But there may be functions that are agnostic to the lane layout of the vector, and treating the vector as an opaque value (just loading it and storing it) would be impossible without a common format across ABI boundaries. So to preserve ABI compatibility, we need to use the ``LDR`` lane layout across function calls. Alignment; ---------. In strict alignment mode, ``LDR qX`` requires its address to be 128-bit aligned, whereas ``LD1`` only requires it to be as aligned as the lane size. If we canonicalised on using ``LDR``, we'd still need to use ``LD1`` in some places to avoid alignment faults (the result of the ``LD1`` would then need to be reversed with ``REV``). Most operating systems however do not run with alignment faults enabled, so this is often not an issue.

ORC is actually fully language agnostic: LLVM IR is not; treated specially, and is supported via the same wrapper mechanism (the; ``MaterializationUnit`` class) that is used for custom compilers. **Concurrent JIT'd code** and **Concurrent Compilation**; JIT'd code may be executed in multiple threads, may spawn new threads, and may; re-enter the ORC (e.g. to request lazy compilation) concurrently from multiple; threads. Compilers launched my ORC can run concurrently (provided the client; sets up an appropriate dispatcher). Built-in dependency tracking ensures that; ORC does not release pointers to JIT'd code or data until all dependencies; have also been JIT'd and they are safe to call or use. **Removable Code**; Resources for JIT'd program representations. **Orthogonality** and **Composability**; Each of the features above can be used independently. It is possible to put; ORC components together to make a non-lazy, in-process, single threaded JIT; or a lazy, out-of-process, concurrent JIT, or anything in between. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT; ===================. ORC provides two basic JIT classes off-the-shelf. These are useful both as; examples of how to assemble ORC components to make a JIT, and as replacements; for earlier LLVM JIT APIs (e.g. MCJIT). The LLJIT class uses an IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer to support; compilation of LLVM IR and linking of relocatable object files. All operations; are performed eagerly on symbol lookup (i.e. a symbol's definition is compiled; as soon as you attempt to look up its address). LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (no",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:3111,release,release,3111,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['release'],['release']

As with the GCC; implementation, these attributes must appertain to the *declarator-id* in a; declaration, which means they must go either at the start of the declaration or; immediately after the name being declared. For example, this applies the GNU ``unused`` attribute to ``a`` and ``f``, and; also applies the GNU ``noreturn`` attribute to ``f``. .. code-block:: c++.

ARM/AArch64 Language Extensions; -------------------------------. Memory Barrier Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang implements the ``__dmb``, ``__dsb`` and ``__isb`` intrinsics as defined; in the `Arm C Language Extensions; <https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/releases>`_.; Note that these intrinsics are implemented as motion barriers that block; reordering of memory accesses and side effect instructions. Other instructions; like simple arithmetic may be reordered around the intrinsic. If you expect to; have no reordering at all, use inline assembly instead. X86/X86-64 Language Extensions; ------------------------------. The X86 backend has these language extensions:. Memory references to specified segments; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Annotating a pointer with address space #256 causes it to be code generated; relative to the X86 GS segment register, address space #257 causes it to be; relative to the X86 FS segment, and address space #258 causes it to be; relative to the X86 SS segment. Note that this is a very very low-level; feature that should only be used if you know what you're doing (for example in; an OS kernel). Here is an example:. .. code-block:: c++. #define GS_RELATIVE __attribute__((address_space(256))); int ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:154776,release,releases,154776,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['release'],['releases']
Deployability,"mmon example is a mutex. For example,; if ``mu`` is a mutex, then calling ``mu.Lock()`` causes the calling thread; to acquire the capability to access data that is protected by ``mu``. Similarly,; calling ``mu.Unlock()`` releases that capability. A thread may hold a capability either *exclusively* or *shared*. An exclusive; capability can be held by only one thread at a time, while a shared capability; can be held by many threads at the same time. This mechanism enforces a; multiple-reader, single-writer pattern. Write operations to protected data; require exclusive access, while read operations require only shared access. At any given moment during program execution, a thread holds a specific set of; capabilities (e.g. the set of mutexes that it has locked.) These act like keys; or tokens that allow the thread to access a given resource. Just like physical; security keys, a thread cannot make copy of a capability, nor can it destroy; one. A thread can only release a capability to another thread, or acquire one; from another thread. The annotations are deliberately agnostic about the; exact mechanism used to acquire and release capabilities; it assumes that the; underlying implementation (e.g. the Mutex implementation) does the handoff in; an appropriate manner. The set of capabilities that are actually held by a given thread at a given; point in program execution is a run-time concept. The static analysis works; by calculating an approximation of that set, called the *capability; environment*. The capability environment is calculated for every program point,; and describes the set of capabilities that are statically known to be held, or; not held, at that particular point. This environment is a conservative; approximation of the full set of capabilities that will actually held by a; thread at run-time. Reference Guide; ===============.

Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first. That is, the test will show a miscompile or; missing optimization. Add a ""TODO"" or ""FIXME"" comment to indicate that; something is expected to change in a test.

Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test.

The AppleScript to do this integration can be found at; `clang/tools/clang-format/clang-format-bbedit.applescript`; place a copy in; `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts`, and edit the path within it to; point to your local copy of :program:`clang-format`.

Note that you can rename the; menu item by renaming the script, and can assign the menu item a keyboard; shortcut in the BBEdit preferences, under Menus & Shortcuts. CLion Integration; =================. :program:`clang-format` is integrated into `CLion <https://www.jetbrains; .com/clion/>`_ as an alternative code formatter. CLion turns it on; automatically when there is a ``.clang-format`` file under the project root.; Code style rules are applied as you type, including indentation,; auto-completion, code generation, and refactorings. :program:`clang-format` can also be enabled without a ``.clang-format`` file.; In this case, CLion prompts you to create one based on the current IDE settings; or the default LLVM style.

For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file. In cases where a configuration file is deployed alongside SDK contents, the; SDK directory can remain fully portable by using ``<CFGDIR>`` prefixed paths.; In this way, the user may only need to specify a root configuration file with; ``--config=`` to establish every aspect of the SDK with the compiler:. ::. --target=foo; -isystem <CFGDIR>/include; -L <CFGDIR>/lib; -T <CFGDIR>/ldscripts/link.ld.

Now after we know in abstract terms what the ROOT framework is, let us; look at the physical directories and files that come with the ROOT; installation. You may work on a platform where your system; administrator has already installed ROOT. You will need to follow the; specific development environment for your setup and you may not have; write access to the directories. In any case, you will need an; environment variable called `ROOTSYS`, which holds the path of the top; ROOT directory. ``` {.cpp}; > echo $ROOTSYS; /opt/root; ```. In the `ROOTSYS` directory are examples, executables, tutorials,; header tutorials files, and, if you opted to download it, the source; is here. The directories of special interest to us are `bin`,; `tutorials`, `lib`, `test`, and` include`. The next figure shows the; contents of these directories. ![ROOT framework directories](pictures/02000004.jpg). ### \$ROOTSYS/bin. The `bin` directory contains several executables. +---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+; | `root` | shows the ROOT splash screen and calls `root.exe` |; +---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+; | `root.exe`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:10672,install,installed,10672,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,1,['install'],['installed']

In the case of a data member which is a pointer to a STL container, eg:; std::container<Data> *fDataObjects;; and which is stored member-wise, add support for the schema evolution of the class 'Data'. This requires a change in the on file format used to store this type; of data members (i.e. by adding inline the version number of the class; 'Data'). To read file containing this construct and written with this revision; using an older version of ROOT you will need the following patches:; For v5.22/00, you will need the patch r33174; or v5.22/00k; For v5.26/00, you will need patch r33176; or v5.26/00c. Additionally, we no longer allow the member wise streaming of a class which; has a custom streamer nor of any data members marked with //||. Run time performance. We introduced an optimized infrastructure for reading objects using a StreamerInfo. Rather than driving the streaming using a switch statement inside TStreamerInfo::ReadBuffer,; the streaming is now driven using a simple loop over a sequence of configured StreamerInfo actions. This improves run-time performance by allowing a dramatic reduction in function calls and code; branches at the expense of some code duplication. There are 3 versions of this loop implemented in TBufferFile and overloaded in TBufferXML and TBufferSQL:. virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence, void *object);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence,; void *start_collection, void *end_collection);; virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoAct",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/v528/index.html:2647,patch,patch,2647,io/doc/v528/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/v528/index.html,2,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"multiple ranges simultaneously.; The definition of such multi-range likelihoods for non-extended fits changes in this release.; Previously, the individual likelihoods were normalized separately in each range, which meant that the relative number of events in each sub-range was not used to estimate the PDF parameters.; From now on, the likelihoods are normalized by the sum of integrals in each range. This implies that the likelihood takes into account all inter-range and intra-range information. ### Deprecation of the `RooMinuit` class. The `RooMinuit` class was the old interface between RooFit and minuit. With ROOT version 5.24, the more general `RooMinimizer` adapter was introduced, which became the default with ROOT 6.08. Before 6.26, it was possible to still use the `RooMinuit` by passing the `Minimizer(""OldMinuit"", ""minimizer"")` command argument to `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()`. This option is now removed. ### Increase of the `RooAbsArg` class version. The class version of `RooAbsArg` was incremented from 7 to 8 in this release. In some circumstances, this can cause warnings in `TStreamerInfo` for classes inheriting from `RooAbsArg` when reading; older RooFit models from a file. These warnings are harmless and can be avoided by incrementing also the class version of the inheriting class. ### Compile-time protection against creating empty `RooCmdArg`s from strings. The implicit [RooCmdArg](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooCmdArg.html) constructor from `const char*` was removed to avoid the accidental construction of meaningless RooCmdArgs that only have a name but no payload.; This causes new compiler errors in your code if you pass a string instead of a RooCmdArg to various RooFit functions, such as [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooAbsPdf.html#a5f79f16f4a26a19c9e66fb5c080f59c5).; If this happens, please consult the documentation of [fitTo()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooAbsPdf.html#a5f79f16f4a26a19c9e66fb5c080f59c5) to check which of the [f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:30817,release,release,30817,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['release'],['release']

The old pythonization with the `__getattr__` syntax still works, but emits a deprecation warning and will be removed from ROOT 6.34. ### Removal of Python 2 support. ROOT does no longer support Python 2. The minimum Python version necessary to use ROOT in a Python application is 3.8.; As a consequence, any reference to Python 2 in ROOT code was removed and certain configuration options are no longer; usable, e.g. * `root-config --python2-version`; * cmake -Dpyroot-python2. The cmake build system now looks for the standard `Python3` package and previously custom Python-related cmake variables; are now just the ones automatically produced by cmake (see https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html). ### More usage of the public cppyy API. Many implementation details of the ROOT pythonizations were moved from C++ functions to pure Python bindings using the; public cppyy API. This helps in the integration with the tool but also improves code efficiency and memory usage. ## Class Reference Guide. - Define missing doxygen groups.; - Fix a few typos in the `THStack` documentation.; - Small fixes in the `THistPainter` documentation.; - Improve the `TColor` documentation: use modern C++ in the examples.; - Make sure the python examples do not generate wrong namespaces in the documentation.; - The dataframe tutorials json spec files were not displayed properly.

If no `RooFit::Extended()` command argument is passed, `RooAbsPdf::chi2FitTo()`; method now does an extended fit by default if the pdf is extendible. This makes; the behavior consistent with `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()`. Same applies to; `RooAbsPdf::createChi2()`. ## TMVA; ### SOFIE : Code generation for fast inference of Deep Learning models; TMVA SOFIE now supports parsing and further inference of Graph Neural Networks based on DeepMind's [graph_nets](https://github.com/google-deepmind/graph_nets). The list of all operators supported in the `RModel` class is the one provided below for the ONNX parser. #### SOFIE-GNN; 1. The SOFIE-GNN implementation brought a major change in SOFIE's architecture. Instead of having only the RModel class to store model information, now SOFIE has RModel, RModel_GNN and RModel_GraphIndependent classes which are inherited from RModel_Base.; 2. **RModel_GNN** is used to store a GNN model having nodes, edges, and globals with functions for their update and aggregate(for inter-relationships).; 3. **RModel_GraphIndependent** is used to store an independent Graph model with nodes, edges and globals with their individual update functions.; 4. **RFunctions** are used to declare update/aggregate operations over graph components. Currently supported RFunctions include:; - **Update Functions**; - RFunction_MLP; - **Aggregate Functions**; - RFunction_Mean; - RFunction_Sum; 5. Pythonized functions for parsing a Graphnets' model can be used to generate inference code; ```; import graph_nets as gn; from graph_nets import utils_tf. GraphModule = gn.modules.GraphNetwork(; edge_model_fn=lambda: snt.nets.MLP([2,2], activate_final=True),; node_model_fn=lambda: snt.nets.MLP([2,2], activate_final=True),; global_model_fn=lambda: snt.nets.MLP([2,2], activate_final=True)).

Deployability,"n `test/` subdirectories are unit tests, mostly based on; [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) and easily extended. Tests in; [roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest.git) are more involved (e.g., tests requiring custom dictionaries or; data files). When you create a branch in the main ROOT repository (i.e., this repository) and add a test to `roottest`,; make sure to do this under the same branch name (and open a PR for it). Our CI infrastructure automatically picks up the; changes defined in the `roottest` PR based on this branch name, and uses that for testing your PR here. ## Continuous Integration. To prevent bad surprises and make a better first impression, we; strongly encourage new developers to [run the tests](https://root.cern/for_developers/run_the_tests/); _before_ submitting a pull request. ROOT has automated CI tests :cop: that are used for pull requests:; - *Build and test*: a [Jenkins-based CI workflow](https://github.com/phsft-bot/build-configuration/blob/master/README.md); as well as a GitHub Actions CI workflow tests PRs automatically; only a; [project member](https://github.com/orgs/root-project/people) is allowed to initiate this build.; The results are posted to the pull request.; Compared to ROOT's nightly builds, PRs are tested with less tests, on less platforms.; - *Formatting check*: `clang-format` automatically checks that a PR; [follows](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format) ROOT's; [coding conventions](https://root.cern/contribute/coding_conventions/).; If coding violations are found, it provides you with a `patch` output that you likely want to apply to your PR.; - *Simple Static Analysis*: PRs are analyzed using [`clang-tidy`](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/).

Most users coming from a GUI will find these shortcuts convenient.; A list of the available key bindings is printed by; ```; root [] .help edit; ```. ## I/O Libraries. ### Faster reading from EOS. A new cross-protocol redirection has been added to allow files on EOS mounts to be opened; by `TFile::Open` via XRootD protocol rather than via FUSE when that is possible. The; redirection uses the `eos.url.xroot` extended file attribute that is present on files in EOS.; The attribute can be viewed with `getfattr -n eos.url.xroot [file]` on the command line.; When the URL passed into `TFile::Open` is a for a file on an EOS mount, the extended; attribute is used to attempt the redirection to XRootD protocol. If the redirection fails,; the file is opened using the plain file path as before. This feature is controlled by the; pre-existing configuration option `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` and is enabled by default.; It can be disabled by setting `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` to `0` in `rootrc`. ## TTree Libraries. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen many updates during the last few months. Specifically, v6.28 includes the following changes:. - Complete support for big-endian architectures (PR [#10402](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10402)). - Support for `std::pair<T1, T2>` and `std::tuple<Ts...>` fields. - Support for C array fields whose type is of the form `T[N]`. Note that only single-dimension arrays are currently supported. - Improvements to the ROOT file embedding (PR [#10558](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10558)). In particular, a `RNTupleReader` or `RDataFrame` object can be created from a `TFile` instance as follows; ```; auto f = TFile::Open(""data.root"");; auto ntpl = f->Get<ROOT::Experimental::RNTuple>(""Events"");. auto reader = ROOT::Experimental::RN",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md:8318,configurat,configuration,8318,README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Alternatively, it is possible to specify constraints to both RooAbsPdf::fitTo() and the RooMCStudy constructor; using the ExternalConstraint() named argument to supply constraint p.d.f.s that are not part of the 'master'; p.d.f but rather an ad-hoc supplied external constraint. The argument supplied to ExternalConstraint() should; be (a set of) constraint p.d.f(s), rather than (a set of) parameters for which internal constraint p.d.f.s should; be picked up. New operator class RooLinearMorph. A new numeric operator class RooLinearMorph has been added that provides a continuous; transformation between two p.d.f.s shapes in terms of a linear parameter alpha. The algorithm ; for histograms is described in the paper by Alex Read in NUM A 425 (1999) 357-369 ; 'Linear interpolation of histograms'. The implementation in RooLinearMorph is for; continuous functions. . // Observable and sampling binning to be used by RooLinearMorph (""cache""); RooRealVar x(""x"",""x"",-20,20) ;; x.setBins(1000,""cache"") ;. // End point shapes : a gaussian on one end, a polynomial on the other; RooGaussian f1(""f1"",""f1"",x,RooConst(-10),RooConst(2)) ;; RooPolynomial f2(""f2"",""f2"",x,RooArgSet(RooConst(-0.03),RooConst(-0.001))) ;. // Interpolation parameter: rlm=f1 at alpha=0, rlm=f2 at alpha=1; RooRealVar alpha(""alpha"",""alpha"",0,1.0) ;; RooLinearMorph rlm(""rlm"",""rlm"",g1,g2,x,alpha) ;. // Plot halfway shape; alpha=0.5; RooPlot* frame = x.frame() ;; rlm.plotOn(frame) ;. In short the algorithm works as follows: for both f1(x) and f2(x), the cumulative distribution; functions F1(x) and F2(x) are calculated. One finds takes a value 'y' of both c.d.fs and ; determines the corresponding x values x1,x2 at which F1(x1)=F2(x2)=y. The value of the interpolated ; p.d.f fbar(x) is then calculated as fbar(alpha*x1+(1-alpha)*x2) = f1(x1)*f2(x2) / ( alpha*f2",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:10090,continuous,continuous,10090,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,2,['continuous'],['continuous']

While it is possible to link C++ code using libstdc++ and code using libc++; together into the same program (so long as you do not attempt to pass C++; standard library objects across the boundary), it is not generally possible; to have more than one C++ ABI library in a program. The version of the C++ ABI library used by Clang will be the one that the; chosen C++ standard library was linked against.

This has been; changed to an Armv9.0a core. However, crypto options are not enabled; by default for Armv9 cores, so `-mcpu=neoverse-n2+crypto` is now required; to enable crypto for this core. As far as the compiler is concerned,; Armv9.0a has the same features enabled as Armv8.5a, with the exception; of crypto. * ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst:2442,configurat,configuration,2442,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,2,"['configurat', 'update']","['configuration', 'updated']"

Tag function parameters with the noundef attribute whenever possible. Modeling Memory Effects; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Mark functions as readnone/readonly/argmemonly or noreturn/nounwind when; known. The optimizer will try to infer these flags, but may not always be; able to. Manual annotations are particularly important for external; functions that the optimizer can not analyze. #. Use the lifetime.start/lifetime.end and invariant.start/invariant.end; intrinsics where possible. Common profitable uses are for stack like data; structures (thus allowing dead store elimination) and for describing; life times of allocas (thus allowing smaller stack sizes). #. Mark invariant locations using !invariant.load and TBAA's constant flags. Pass Ordering; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One of the most common mistakes made by new language frontend projects is to; use the existing -O2 or -O3 pass pipelines as is. These pass pipelines make a; good starting point for an optimizing compiler for any language, but they have; been carefully tuned for C and C++, not your target language. You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.rst:12476,pipeline,pipelines,12476,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipelines']
Deployability,"n hidden; visibility receive public LTO visibility. When targeting Windows, classes; with dllimport or dllexport attributes receive public LTO visibility. All; other classes receive hidden LTO visibility. Classes with internal linkage; (e.g. classes declared in unnamed namespaces) also receive hidden LTO; visibility. During the LTO link, all classes with public LTO visibility but not marked with; ``[[clang::lto_visibility_public]]`` (see below) will be refined to hidden LTO; visibility when the ``--lto-whole-program-visibility`` lld linker option is; applied (``-plugin-opt=whole-program-visibility`` for gold). This flag can be; used to defer specifying whether classes have hidden LTO visibility until link; time, to allow bitcode objects to be shared by different LTO links. Due to an; implementation limitation, symbols associated with classes with hidden LTO; visibility may still be exported from the binary when using this flag. It is; unsafe to refer to these symbols, and their visibility may be relaxed to hidden; in a future compiler release. A class defined in a translation unit built without LTO receives public; LTO visibility regardless of its object file visibility, linkage or other; attributes. This mechanism will produce the correct result in most cases, but there are; two cases where it may wrongly infer hidden LTO visibility. 1. As a corollary of the above rules, if a linkage unit is produced from a; combination of LTO object files and non-LTO object files, any hidden; visibility class defined in both a translation unit built with LTO and; a translation unit built without LTO must be defined with public LTO; visibility in order to avoid an ODR violation. 2. Some ABIs provide the ability to define an abstract base class without; visibility attributes in multiple linkage units and have virtual calls; to derived classes in other linkage units work correctly. One example of; this is COM on Windows platforms.

Deployability,"n how to reduce cycle times. Restrict what you build and test; Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build; configuration as much as you can. Basic functionality is probably; already covered by other bots, and you don't need to duplicate that; testing. You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.). It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more,; if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder. As an example,; if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host; compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you; may be better off with two separate bots. Splitting increases resource; consumption, but makes it easy for each bot to keep up with commit flow.; Additionally, splitting bots may assist in triage by narrowing attention to; relevant parts of the failing configuration. In general, we recommend Release build types with Assertions enabled. This; generally provides a good balance between build times and bug detection for; most buildbots. There may be room for including some debug info (e.g. with; `-gmlt`), but in general the balance between debug info quality and build; times is a delicate one. Use Ninja & LLD; Ninja really does help build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly. With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing. Use CCache and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental build",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst:10374,configurat,configuration,10374,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,1,['configurat'],['configuration']
Deployability,"n is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca technique to avoid; using a PHI node:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; store i32 %X.0, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; store i32 %X.1, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = load i32, i32* %X ; Read X; ret i32 %X.2; }. With this, we have discovered a way to handle arbitrary mutable; variables without the need to create Phi nodes at all:. #. Each mutable variable becomes a stack allocation.; #. Each read of the variable becomes a load from the stack.; #. Each update of the variable becomes a store to the stack.; #. Taking the address of a variable just uses the stack address; directly. While this solution has solved our immediate problem, it introduced; another one: we have now apparently introduced a lot of stack traffic; for very simple and common operations, a major performance problem.; Fortunately for us, the LLVM optimizer has a highly-tuned optimization; pass named ""mem2reg"" that handles this case, promoting allocas like this; into SSA registers, inserting Phi nodes as appropriate. If you run this; example through the pass, for example, you'll get:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-as < example.ll | opt -passes=mem2reg | llvm-dis; @G = weak global i32 0; @H = weak global i32 0. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.01 = phi i32 [ %X.1, %cond_false ], [ %X.0, %cond_true ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:6323,update,update,6323,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['update'],['update']

This reduces the scope for lock contention. Most significantly, it enables the use of concurrency on the prompt!. ## I/O Libraries. - Introduce TKey::ReadObject<typeName>. This is a user friendly wrapper around ReadObjectAny. For example; ```; auto h1 = key->ReadObject<TH1>; ```; after which h1 will either be null if the key contains something that is not a TH1 (or derived class); or will be set to the address of the histogram read from the file.; - Add the ability to store the 'same' object several time (assumingly with different data) in a single buffer. Instead of. ```; while(...) {; TObjArray arr;; ... update the content of ""arr""; buffer << arr;; }; ```; which would only really stream the array at the first iteration because it will be detected has having the same address and thus assumed to be the same object. We can now do:; ```; while(...) {; TObjArray arr;; ... update the content of ""arr""; buffer.WriteObject(&arr, kFALSE);; }; ```; where the last argument of WriteObject tells the buffer do *not* remember this object's address and to always stream it. This feature is also available via WriteObjectAny. - Added a new mechanism for providing clean forward-compatibility breaks in a ``TTree`` (i.e., a newer version of ROOT writes a ``TTree`` an older version cannot read). When future versions of ROOT utilize an IO feature that this version does not support, ROOT will provide a clear error message instead of crashing or returning garbage data. In future ROOT6 releases, forward-compatibility breaks will only be allowed if a non-default feature is enabled via the ``ROOT::Experimental`` namespace; it is expected ROOT7 will enable forward-compatibility breaks by default. - When a file using an ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md:6861,update,update,6861,README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,1,['update'],['update']

A function can also return an object to a caller by a means of an out parameter; (a pointer-to-OSObject-pointer is passed, and a callee writes a pointer to an; object into an argument).; Currently the analyzer does not track unannotated out; parameters by default, but with annotations we distinguish four separate cases:. 1. Non-retained out parameters, identified using; LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED applied to parameters, e.g.:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). Such functions write a non-retained object into an out parameter, and the; caller has no further obligations.; 2. Retained out parameters,; identified using LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). In such cases a retained object is written into an out parameter, which the caller has then to release in order to avoid a leak. These two cases are simple - but in practice a functions returning an out-parameter usually also return a return code, and then an out parameter may or may not be written, which conditionally depends on the exit code, e.g.:. bool maybeCreateObject(LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED OSObject **obj);. For such functions, the usual semantics is that an object is written into on ""success"", and not written into on ""failure"".; For LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED we assume the following definition of; success:; For functions returning OSReturn or IOReturn; (any typedef to kern_return_t) success is defined as having an output of zero (kIOReturnSuccess is zero).; For all others, success is non-zero (e.g. non-nullptr for pointers); 3.

CUDA compilation is supported on Linux. Compilation on MacOS and Windows may or; may not work and currently have no maintainers. Invoking clang; --------------. Invoking clang for CUDA compilation works similarly to compiling regular C++.; You just need to be aware of a few additional flags. You can use `this <https://gist.github.com/855e277884eb6b388cd2f00d956c2fd4>`_; program as a toy example. Save it as ``axpy.cu``. (Clang detects that you're; compiling CUDA code by noticing that your filename ends with ``.cu``.; Alternatively, you can pass ``-x cuda``.). To build and run, run the following commands, filling in the parts in angle; brackets as described below:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ axpy.cu -o axpy --cuda-gpu-arch=<GPU arch> \; -L<CUDA install path>/<lib64 or lib> \; -lcudart_static -ldl -lrt -pthread; $ ./axpy; y[0] = 2; y[1] = 4; y[2] = 6; y[3] = 8.

To define a ``RegisterClass``, use the following 4 arguments:. * The first argument of the definition is the name of the namespace. * The second argument is a list of ``ValueType`` register type values that are; defined in ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ValueTypes.td``. Defined values include; integer types (such as ``i16``, ``i32``, and ``i1`` for Boolean),; floating-point types (``f32``, ``f64``), and vector types (for example,; ``v8i16`` for an ``8 x i16`` vector). All registers in a ``RegisterClass``; must have the same ``ValueType``, but some registers may store vector data in; different configurations. For example a register that can process a 128-bit; vector may be able to handle 16 8-bit integer elements, 8 16-bit integers, 4; 32-bit integers, and so on. * The third argument of the ``RegisterClass`` definition specifies the; alignment required of the registers when they are stored or loaded to; memory. * The final argument, ``regList``, specifies which registers are in this class.; If an alternative allocation order method is not specified, then ``regList``; also defines the order of allocation used by the register allocator.

For layering reasons, ``MachineVerifier`` isn't able to be the sole verifier; in GlobalISel. Currently some of the passes also perform verification while; we find a way to solve this problem. The main issue is that GlobalISel is a separate library, so we can't; directly reference it from CodeGen. Testing; -------. The ability to test GlobalISel is significantly improved over SelectionDAG.; SelectionDAG is something of a black box and there's a lot going on inside it.; This makes it difficult to write a test that reliably tests a particular aspect; of its behaviour. For comparison, see the following diagram:. .. image:: testing-pass-level.png. Each of the grey boxes indicates an opportunity to serialize the current state; and test the behaviour between two points in the pipeline. The current state; can be serialized using ``-stop-before`` or ``-stop-after`` and loaded using; ``-start-before``, ``-start-after``, and ``-run-pass``.

Please refer to CMake's release notes for further; information. The method to select the C++ standard has changed. Now the recommended way; to select the C++ standard is via the option `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=XX`, which; is the idiomatic way to do it in CMake. The old options still work, but have; been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Build option descriptions have been updated to indicate which builtins require; an active network connection during the build. You can inspect the list of; options and their descriptions by running `cmake -LH $PWD` in the build; directory. The build system has been updated to remove most file globbing to improve; the reliability of incremental builds when source files are added or removed. A new check has been added to make ROOT fail during the configuration step; if incompatible versions of the Python interpreter and its libraries are; selected. The `all=ON` option now tries to enable more options. Some options had their; default value toggled to disabled, which affected `all=ON`. Now all options; are listed explicitly so that they are enabled regardless of their default; value. ### Builtins. The following builtins had their versions updated for this release:. * VecCore 0.5.2; * Vc 1.4.1; * XRootD 4.8.5; * OpenSSL 1.0.2q; * PCRE 8.42. ### Header location and `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` / `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

Common CMake configuration options:; -----------------------------------. * ``-D_LIBCPP_ABI_FORCE_ITANIUM'``. Tell the libc++ headers that the Itanium C++ ABI is being used. * ``-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-lmsvcrt -llegacy_stdio_definitions -D_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE""``. Supply CRT definitions including stdio definitions that have been removed from the MS VS CRT.; We don't want the stdio functions declared inline as they will cause multiple definition; errors when the same symbols are pulled in from legacy_stdio_definitions.ib. * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install path>``. Where to install the library and headers. Building libunwind:; -------------------. * ``-DLIBUNWIND_ENABLE_SHARED=ON``; * ``-DLIBUNWIND_ENABLE_STATIC=OFF``. libunwind can be built as a DLL. It is not dependent on other projects. * ``-DLIBUNWIND_USE_COMPILER_RT=OFF``. We use the MS runtime.

Deployability,"n the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/usr/include``, create a subdirectory; ``build/usr/include`` and place the header ``mylib.h`` into that; subdirectory. If ``mylib.h`` depends on other headers, then they can be; stored within ``build/usr/include`` in a way that mimics the installed; location. Building a relocatable precompiled header requires two additional; arguments. First, pass the ``--relocatable-pch`` flag to indicate that; the resulting PCH file should be relocatable. Second, pass; ``-isysroot /path/to/build``, which makes all includes for your library; relative to the build directory. For example:. .. code-block:: console. # clang -x c-header --relocatable-pch -isysroot /path/to/build /path/to/build/mylib.h mylib.h.pch. When loading the relocatable PCH file, the various headers used in the; PCH file are found from the system header root. For example, ``mylib.h``; can be found in ``/usr/include/mylib.h``. If the headers are installed; in some other system root, the ``-isysroot`` option can be used provide; a different system root from which the headers will be based. For; example, ``-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk`` will look for; ``mylib.h`` in ``/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/include/myl",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:48791,install,installed,48791,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['install'],['installed']

Deployability,"n this document we refer to the ""runtime"" collectively as all; components that serve as the LLVM client, including the LLVM IR; generator, object code consumer, and code patcher. A stack map records the location of ``live values`` at a particular; instruction address. These ``live values`` do not refer to all the; LLVM values live across the stack map. Instead, they are only the; values that the runtime requires to be live at this point. For; example, they may be the values the runtime will need to resume; program execution at that point independent of the compiled function; containing the stack map. LLVM emits stack map data into the object code within a designated; :ref:`stackmap-section`. This stack map data contains a record for; each stack map. The record stores the stack map's instruction address; and contains an entry for each mapped value. Each entry encodes a; value's location as a register, stack offset, or constant. A patch point is an instruction address at which space is reserved for; patching a new instruction sequence at run time. Patch points look; much like calls to LLVM. They take arguments that follow a calling; convention and may return a value. They also imply stack map; generation, which allows the runtime to locate the patchpoint and; find the location of ``live values`` at that point. Motivation; ==========. This functionality is currently experimental but is potentially useful; in a variety of settings, the most obvious being a runtime (JIT); compiler. Example applications of the patchpoint intrinsics are; implementing an inline call cache for polymorphic method dispatch or; optimizing the retrieval of properties in dynamically typed languages; such as JavaScript. The intrinsics documented here are currently used by the JavaScript; compiler within the open source WebKit project, see the `FTL JIT; <https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT>`_, but they are designed to be; used whenever stack maps or code patching are needed.

Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:27260,update,update,27260,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['update'],['update']

The ``_Float16`` type is an interchange floating type specified in; ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015 (""Floating-point extensions for C""). It will; be supported on more targets as they define ABIs for it. The ``__bf16`` type is a non-standard extension, but it generally follows; the rules for arithmetic interchange floating types from ISO/IEC TS; 18661-3:2015. In previous versions of Clang, it was a storage-only type; that forbade arithmetic operations. It will be supported on more targets; as they define ABIs for it. The ``__fp16`` type was originally an ARM extension and is specified; by the `ARM C Language Extensions <https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/releases>`_.; Clang uses the ``binary16`` format from IEEE 754-2008 for ``__fp16``,; not the ARM alternative format. Operators that expect arithmetic operands; immediately promote ``__fp16`` operands to ``float``. It is recommended that portable code use ``_Float16`` instead of ``__fp16``,; as it has been defined by the C standards committee and has behavior that is; more familiar to most programmers. Because ``__fp16`` operands are always immediately promoted to ``float``, the; common real type of ``__fp16`` and ``_Float16`` for the purposes of the usual; arithmetic conversions is ``float``.

As a community, we strongly value having the tip of tree in a good state while; allowing rapid iterative development. As such, we tend to make much heavier; use of reverts to keep the tree healthy than some other open source projects,; and our norms are a bit different. How should you respond if someone reverted your change?. * Remember, it is normal and healthy to have patches reverted.

When should you revert your own change?. * Any time you learn of a serious problem with a change, you should revert it.; We strongly encourage ""revert to green"" as opposed to ""fixing forward"". We; encourage reverting first, investigating offline, and then reapplying the; fixed patch - possibly after another round of review if warranted.; * If you break a buildbot in a way which can't be quickly fixed, please revert.; * If a test case that demonstrates a problem is reported in the commit thread,; please revert and investigate offline.; * If you receive substantial :ref:`post-commit review <post_commit_review>`; feedback, please revert and address said feedback before recommitting.; (Possibly after another round of review.); * If you are asked to revert by another contributor, please revert and discuss; the merits of the request offline (unless doing so would further destabilize; tip of tree).

There is an integration for :program:`vim` which lets you run the; :program:`clang-format` standalone tool on your current buffer, optionally; selecting regions to reformat. The integration has the form of a `python`-file; which can be found under `clang/tools/clang-format/clang-format.py`. This can be integrated by adding the following to your `.vimrc`:. .. code-block:: vim. if has('python'); map <C-K> :pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; imap <C-K> <c-o>:pyf <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; elseif has('python3'); map <C-K> :py3f <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; imap <C-K> <c-o>:py3f <path-to-this-file>/clang-format.py<cr>; endif. The first line enables :program:`clang-format` for NORMAL and VISUAL mode, the; second line adds support for INSERT mode. Change ""C-K"" to another binding if; you need :program:`clang-format` on a different key (C-K stands for Ctrl+k). With this integration you can press the bound key and clang-format will; format the current line in NORMAL and INSERT mode or the selected region in; VISUAL mode. The line or region is extended to the next bigger syntactic; entity. It operates on the current, potentially unsaved buffer and does not create; or save any files. To revert a formatting, just undo. An alternative option is to format changes when saving a file and thus to; have a zero-effort integration into the coding workflow. To do this, add this to; your `.vimrc`:. .. code-block:: vim. function!

This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:. Multi-distribution configurations; ---------------------------------. The ``install-distribution`` target described above is for building a single; distribution. LLVM's build system also supports building multiple distributions,; which can be used to e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and; another for libraries (to enable development). These are configured by setting; the *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS* variable to hold a list of all distribution names; (which conventionally start with an uppercase letter, e.g. ""Development""), and; then setting the *LLVM_<distribution>_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* variable to the; list of targets for that distribution. For each distribution, the build system; generates an ``install-${distribution}-distribution`` target, where; ``${distribution}`` is the name of the distribution in lowercase, to install; that distribution. Each distribution creates its own set of CMake exports, and the target to; install the CMake exports for a particular distribution for a project is named; ``${project}-${distribution}-cmake-exports``, where ``${project}`` is the name; of the project in lowercase and ``${distribution}`` is the name of the; distribution in lowercase, unless the project is LLVM, in which case the target; is just named ``${distribution}-cmake-exports``.

To; check whether assignment tracking is enabled for a module call; `isAssignmentTrackingEnabled(const Module &M)` (from `llvm/IR/DebugInfo.h`). ## Design and implementation. ### Assignment markers: `llvm.dbg.assign`. `llvm.dbg.value`, a conventional debug intrinsic, marks out a position in the; IR where a variable takes a particular value. Similarly, Assignment Tracking; marks out the position of assignments with a new intrinsic called; `llvm.dbg.assign`. In order to know where in IR it is appropriate to use a memory location for a; variable, each assignment marker must in some way refer to the store, if any; (or multiple!), that performs the assignment. That way, the position of the; store and marker can be considered together when making that choice. Another; important benefit of referring to the store is that we can then build a two-way; mapping of stores<->markers that can be used to find markers that need to be; updated when stores are modified. An `llvm.dbg.assign` marker that is not linked to any instruction signals that; the store that performed the assignment has been optimised out, and therefore; the memory location will not be valid for at least some part of the program. Here's the `llvm.dbg.assign` signature. Each parameter is wrapped in; `MetadataAsValue`, and `Value *` type parameters are first wrapped in; `ValueAsMetadata`:. ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(Value *Value,; DIExpression *ValueExpression,; DILocalVariable *Variable,; DIAssignID *ID,; Value *Address,; DIExpression *AddressExpression); ```. The first three parameters look and behave like an `llvm.dbg.value`. `ID` is a; reference to a store (see next section). `Address` is the destination address; of the store and it is modified by `AddressExpression`. An empty/undef/poison; address means the address component has been killed (the memory address is no; longer a ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md:2459,update,updated,2459,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"nal line here is quite subtle, but is very important. The basic; issue is that when we create the Phi node in the merge block, we need to; set up the block/value pairs that indicate how the Phi will work.; Importantly, the Phi node expects to have an entry for each predecessor; of the block in the CFG. Why then, are we getting the current block when; we just set it to ThenBB 5 lines above? The problem is that the ""Then""; expression may actually itself change the block that the Builder is; emitting into if, for example, it contains a nested ""if/then/else""; expression. Because calling ``codegen()`` recursively could arbitrarily change; the notion of the current block, we are required to get an up-to-date; value for code that will set up the Phi node. .. code-block:: c++. // Emit else block.; TheFunction->insert(TheFunction->end(), ElseBB);; Builder->SetInsertPoint(ElseBB);. Value *ElseV = Else->codegen();; if (!ElseV); return nullptr;. Builder->CreateBr(MergeBB);; // codegen of 'Else' can change the current block, update ElseBB for the PHI.; ElseBB = Builder->GetInsertBlock();. Code generation for the 'else' block is basically identical to codegen; for the 'then' block. The only significant difference is the first line,; which adds the 'else' block to the function. Recall previously that the; 'else' block was created, but not added to the function. Now that the; 'then' and 'else' blocks are emitted, we can finish up with the merge; code:. .. code-block:: c++. // Emit merge block.; TheFunction->insert(TheFunction->end(), MergeBB);; Builder->SetInsertPoint(MergeBB);; PHINode *PN =; Builder->CreatePHI(Type::getDoubleTy(*TheContext), 2, ""iftmp"");.

The following process occurs on the discussion medium for each reported issue:. * A security issue reporter (not necessarily an LLVM contributor) reports an issue.; * Within two business days, a member of the Security Group is put in charge of driving the issue to an acceptable resolution. This champion doesn’t need to be the same person for each issue. This person can self-nominate.; * Members of the Security Group discuss in which circumstances (if any) an issue is relevant to security, and determine if it is a security issue.; * Negotiate an embargo date for public disclosure, with a default minimum time limit of ninety days.; * Security Group members can recommend that key experts be pulled in to specific issue discussions. The key expert can be pulled in unless there are objections from other Security Group members.; * Patches are written and reviewed.; * Backporting security patches from recent versions to old versions cannot always work. It is up to the Security Group to decide if such backporting should be done, and how far back.; * The Security Group figures out how the LLVM project’s own releases, as well as individual vendors’ releases, can be timed to patch the issue simultaneously.; * Embargo date can be delayed or pulled forward at the Security Group’s discretion.; * The issue champion obtains a CVE entry from MITRE_.; * Once the embargo expires, the patch is posted publicly according to LLVM’s usual code review process.; * All security issues (as well as nomination / removal discussions) become public within approximately fourteen weeks of the fix landing in the LLVM repository.

One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from any anywhere within the application.

Deployability,"nd purpose: they; establish the substitution order so that both ``%{check}`` and its parameters; expand as desired. There's a simple way to remember the required definition; order in a test file: define a substitution before any substitution that might; refer to it. In general, substitution expansion behaves as follows:. - Upon arriving at each ``RUN:`` line, lit expands all substitutions in that; ``RUN:`` line using their current values from the substitution list. No; substitution expansion is performed immediately at ``DEFINE:`` and; ``REDEFINE:`` directives except ``%(line)``, ``%(line+<number>)``, and; ``%(line-<number>)``.; - When expanding substitutions in a ``RUN:`` line, lit makes only one pass; through the substitution list by default. In this case, a substitution must; have been inserted earlier in the substitution list than any substitution; appearing in its value in order for the latter to expand. (For greater; flexibility, you can enable multiple passes through the substitution list by; setting `recursiveExpansionLimit`_ in a lit configuration file.); - While lit configuration files can insert anywhere in the substitution list,; the insertion behavior of the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives is; specified below and is designed specifically for the use case presented in the; example above.; - Defining a substitution in terms of itself, whether directly or via other; substitutions, should be avoided. It usually produces an infinitely recursive; definition that cannot be fully expanded. It does *not* define the; substitution in terms of its previous value, even when using ``REDEFINE:``. The relationship between the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directive is; analogous to the relationship between a variable declaration and variable; assignment in many programming languages:. - ``DEFINE: %{name} = value``. This directive assigns the specified value to a new substitution whose; pattern is ``%{name}``, or it reports an error if there is already a; subst",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:31766,configurat,configuration,31766,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

This method is implemented using the class `LogLikelihoodFCN`; * **Linear Fit**: A linear fit can be selected (no iterative minimization is needed in this case, but using linear algebra algorithms from the *Matrix* library), if the model function is linear in the; parameters. #### Customised Fit methods. Above we described the pre-defined methods used for fitting. A user can also implement its own fitting methods, thus its version of the chi-square or likelihood function he wants to minimize.; In this case, the user does not really need to build as input a `ROOT::Fit` data set and model function as we described before. He can implements its own version of the method function using on its own; data set objects and functions. In this case `ROOT::Fit::Fitter::SetFCN` is used to set the method function and `ROOT::Fit::FitFCN` is used for fitting. The method function can be passed also in `ROOT::Fit::FitFCN`, but in this; case a previously defined fitting configuration is used.

In other word, the lock is re-entrant for both reading and writing. The implementation tries to make faster the scenario when readers come and go but there is no writer.

Deployability,"ned Allocator; ========================. .. contents::; :local:; :depth: 2. Introduction; ============. The Scudo Hardened Allocator is a user-mode allocator, originally based on LLVM; Sanitizers'; `CombinedAllocator <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/compiler-rt/lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_allocator_combined.h>`_.; It aims at providing additional mitigation against heap based vulnerabilities,; while maintaining good performance. Scudo is currently the default allocator in; `Fuchsia <https://fuchsia.dev/>`_, and in `Android <https://www.android.com/>`_; since Android 11. The name ""Scudo"" comes from the Italian word for; `shield <https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/scudo>`_; (and Escudo in Spanish). Design; ======. Allocator; ---------; Scudo was designed with security in mind, but aims at striking a good balance; between security and performance. It was designed to be highly tunable and; configurable, and while we provide some default configurations, we encourage; consumers to come up with the parameters that will work best for their use; cases. The allocator combines several components that serve distinct purposes:. - the Primary allocator: fast and efficient, it services smaller allocation; sizes by carving reserved memory regions into blocks of identical size. There; are currently two Primary allocators implemented, specific to 32 and 64 bit; architectures. It is configurable via compile time options. - the Secondary allocator: slower, it services larger allocation sizes via the; memory mapping primitives of the underlying operating system. Secondary backed; allocations are surrounded by Guard Pages. It is also configurable via compile; time options. - the thread specific data Registry: defines how local caches operate for each; thread. There are currently two models implemented: the exclusive model where; each thread holds its own caches (using the ELF TLS); or the shared model; where threads share a fixed size pool of cac",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst:1027,configurat,configurations,1027,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst,1,['configurat'],['configurations']

""``CHECK-SAME:``"" directives reject the input if there are any newlines between; it and the previous directive. ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" is also useful to avoid writing matchers for irrelevant; fields. For example, suppose you're writing a test which parses a tool that; generates output like this:. .. code-block:: text. Name: foo; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. Name: bar; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 2. Name: baz; Field1: ...; Field2: ...; Field3: ...; Value: 1. To write a test that verifies ``foo`` has the value ``1``, you might first; write this:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value: 1{{$}}. However, this would be a bad test: if the value for ``foo`` changes, the test; would still pass because the ""``CHECK: Value: 1``"" line would match the value; from ``baz``. To fix this, you could add ``CHECK-NEXT`` matchers for every; ``FieldN:`` line, but that would be verbose, and need to be updated when; ``Field4`` is added. A more succinct way to write the test using the; ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" matcher would be as follows:. .. code-block:: text. CHECK: Name: foo; CHECK: Value:; CHECK-SAME: {{ 1$}}. This verifies that the *next* time ""``Value:``"" appears in the output, it has; the value ``1``. Note: a ""``CHECK-SAME:``"" cannot be the first directive in a file. The ""CHECK-EMPTY:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. If you need to check that the next line has nothing on it, not even whitespace,; you can use the ""``CHECK-EMPTY:``"" directive. .. code-block:: llvm. declare void @foo(). declare void @bar(); ; CHECK: foo; ; CHECK-EMPTY:; ; CHECK-NEXT: bar. Just like ""``CHECK-NEXT:``"" the directive will fail if there is more than one; newline before it finds the next blank line, and it cannot be the first; directive in a file.

It would also be reasonable to use debug information to feed profiling tools; for analysis of generated code, or, tools for reconstructing the original; source from generated code. .. _intro_debugopt:. Debug information and optimizations; -----------------------------------. An extremely high priority of LLVM debugging information is to make it interact; well with optimizations and analysis. In particular, the LLVM debug; information provides the following guarantees:. * LLVM debug information **always provides information to accurately read; the source-level state of the program**, regardless of which LLVM; optimizations have been run. :doc:`HowToUpdateDebugInfo` specifies how debug; info should be updated in various kinds of code transformations to avoid; breaking this guarantee, and how to preserve as much useful debug info as; possible. Note that some optimizations may impact the ability to modify the; current state of the program with a debugger, such as setting program; variables, or calling functions that have been deleted. * As desired, LLVM optimizations can be upgraded to be aware of debugging; information, allowing them to update the debugging information as they; perform aggressive optimizations. This means that, with effort, the LLVM; optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code. * LLVM debug information does not prevent optimizations from; happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,; tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed.

You can also; instrument just a sampled subset of functions using instrumentation groups.; For example, to instrument only a quarter of available functions invoke:. ::. clang -fxray-instrument -fxray-function-groups=4.

To sample a; different subset you can specify ``-fxray-selected-function-group=`` with a group number; in the range of 0 to ``xray-function-groups`` - 1.

Deployability,"ng the original; source from generated code. .. _intro_debugopt:. Debug information and optimizations; -----------------------------------. An extremely high priority of LLVM debugging information is to make it interact; well with optimizations and analysis. In particular, the LLVM debug; information provides the following guarantees:. * LLVM debug information **always provides information to accurately read; the source-level state of the program**, regardless of which LLVM; optimizations have been run. :doc:`HowToUpdateDebugInfo` specifies how debug; info should be updated in various kinds of code transformations to avoid; breaking this guarantee, and how to preserve as much useful debug info as; possible. Note that some optimizations may impact the ability to modify the; current state of the program with a debugger, such as setting program; variables, or calling functions that have been deleted. * As desired, LLVM optimizations can be upgraded to be aware of debugging; information, allowing them to update the debugging information as they; perform aggressive optimizations. This means that, with effort, the LLVM; optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code. * LLVM debug information does not prevent optimizations from; happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,; tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:4482,upgrade,upgraded,4482,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,2,"['update', 'upgrade']","['update', 'upgraded']"

Deployability,"ning the; bounds information is updated. For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them. This prevents ``buf`` and; ``count`` from temporarily falling out of sync due to updates happening at a; distance. The example below shows a function ``alloc_buf`` that initializes a struct that; members that use the ``__counted_by`` annotation. The compiler allows these; assignments because ``sbuf->buf`` and ``sbuf->count`` are updated side by side; without any side effects in between the assignments. Furthermore, the compiler inserts additional run-time checks to ensure the new; ``buf`` has at least as many elements as the new ``count`` indicates as shown in; the transformed pseudo code of function ``alloc_buf()`` in the example below. .. code-block:: c. typedef struct {; int *__counted_by(count) buf;; size_t count;; } sized_buf_t;. void alloc_buf(sized_buf_t *sbuf, sized_t nelems) {; sbuf->buf = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * nelems);; sbuf->count = nelems;; }. // Transformed pseudo code:; void alloc_buf(sized_buf_t *sbuf, sized_t nelems) {; // Materialize RHS values:; int *tmp_ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * nelems);; int tmp_count = nele",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:36374,update,updates,36374,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['update'],['updates']

Below there's a list of some dependencies, but your project could; have more, or this document could be outdated. You'll see the errors; while linking as an indication of that. Debian based distros have a way to add ``multiarch``, which adds; a new architecture and allows you to install packages for those; systems. See https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO for more info. But not all distros will have that, and possibly not an easy way to; install them in any anyway, so you'll have to build/download; them separately.

Note that the ``libXXX``; will have the shared objects (``.so``) and the ``libXXX-dev`` will; give you the headers and the static (``.a``) library. Just in; case, download both.

Deployability,"nk the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed. Things become even more; interesting if we consider interprocedural optimizations like inlining, which; must be performed eagerly. These are complex trade-offs, and there is no; one-size-fits all solution to them, but by providing composable layers we leave; the decisions to the person implementing the JIT, and make it easy for them to; experiment with different configurations. `Next: Adding Per-function Lazy Compilation <BuildingAJIT3.html>`_.

Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself. Multi-phase communication between ``libLTO`` and linker; =======================================================. The linker collects information about symbol definitions and uses in various; link objects which is more accurate than any information collected by other; tools during typical build cycles. The linker collects this information by; looking at the definitions and uses of symbols in native .o files and using; symbol visibility information. The linker also uses user-supplied information,; such as a list of exported symbols. LLVM optimizer collects control flow; information, data flow information and knows much more about program structure; from the optimizer's point of view. Our goal is to take advantage of tight; integration between the linker and the optimizer by sharing this information; during various linking phases. Phase 1 : Read LLVM Bitcode Files; ---------------------------------. The linker first reads all object files in natural order and collects symbol; information. This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table. The lto* functions are all implemented in a shared object libLTO. This allows; the LLVM LTO code to be updated independently of the linker tool. On platforms; that support it, the share",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst:5328,integrat,integration,5328,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,1,['integrat'],['integration']

A good way for new contributors to increase their knowledge of the code base is; to review code. It is perfectly acceptable to review code and explicitly; defer to others for approval decisions. Experts Should Review Code; --------------------------. If you are an expert in an area of the compiler affected by a proposed patch,; then you are highly encouraged to review the code. If you are a relevant code; owner, and no other experts are reviewing a patch, you must either help arrange; for an expert to review the patch or review it yourself. Code Reviews, Speed, and Reciprocity; ------------------------------------. Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you might hope, especially for; larger features. Common ways to speed up review times for your patches are:. * Review other people's patches. If you help out, everybody will be more; willing to do the same for you; goodwill is our currency.; * Ping the patch. If it is urgent, provide reasons why it is important to you to; get this patch landed and ping it every couple of days. If it is; not urgent, the common courtesy ping rate is one week. Remember that you're; asking for valuable time from other professional developers.; * Ask for help on IRC.

Deployability,"nt() method should allocate space for one; more element (using default constructor if element is a C++ object) and returns; a reference to that new allocated space. Flow Sequence; -------------; A YAML ""flow sequence"" is a sequence that when written to YAML it uses the; inline notation (e.g [ foo, bar ] ). To specify that a sequence type should; be written in YAML as a flow sequence, your SequenceTraits specialization should; add ""static const bool flow = true;"". For instance:. .. code-block:: c++. template <>; struct SequenceTraits<MyList> {; static size_t size(IO &io, MyList &list) { ... }; static MyListEl &element(IO &io, MyList &list, size_t index) { ... }. // The existence of this member causes YAML I/O to use a flow sequence; static const bool flow = true;; };. With the above, if you used MyList as the data type in your native data; structures, then when converted to YAML, a flow sequence of integers; will be used (e.g. [ 10, -3, 4 ]). Flow sequences are subject to line wrapping according to the Output object; configuration. Utility Macros; --------------; Since a common source of sequences is std::vector<>, YAML I/O provides macros:; LLVM_YAML_IS_SEQUENCE_VECTOR() and LLVM_YAML_IS_FLOW_SEQUENCE_VECTOR() which; can be used to easily specify SequenceTraits<> on a std::vector type. YAML; I/O does not partial specialize SequenceTraits on std::vector<> because that; would force all vectors to be sequences. An example use of the macros:. .. code-block:: c++. std::vector<MyType1>;; std::vector<MyType2>;; LLVM_YAML_IS_SEQUENCE_VECTOR(MyType1); LLVM_YAML_IS_FLOW_SEQUENCE_VECTOR(MyType2).

We can define a special thread-local value to hold the predicate state between; functions. This avoids direct ABI implications by using a side channel between; callers and callees to communicate the predicate state. It also allows implicit; zero-initialization of the state, which allows non-checked code to be the first; code executed. However, this requires a load from TLS in the entry block, a store to TLS; before every call and every ret, and a load from TLS after every call. As a; consequence it is expected to be substantially more expensive even than using; `%rsp` and potentially `lfence` within the function entry block. ##### Define a new ABI and/or calling convention. We could define a new ABI and/or calling convention to explicitly pass the; predicate state in and out of functions. This may be interesting if none of the; alternatives have adequate performance, but it makes deployment and adoption; dramatically more complex, and potentially infeasible. ## High-Level Alternative Mitigation Strategies. There are completely different alternative approaches to mitigating variant 1; attacks.

Deployability,"ntal status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed. The stack map functionality described in this document is separate; from the functionality described in; :ref:`stack-map`. `GCFunctionMetadata` provides the location of; pointers into a collected heap captured by the `GCRoot` intrinsic,; which can also be considered a ""stack map"". Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack map. The stack maps described here could potentially provide; richer information to a garbage collecting runtime, but that usage; will not be discussed in this document. Intrinsics; ==========. The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling.

The public member function `RooDataHist::sum()` has three overloads.; Two of these overloads accept a `sumSet` parameter to not sum over all variables.; These two overloads previously behaved inconsistently when the `correctForBinSize` or `inverseBinCor` flags were set.; If you use the `RooDataHist::sum()` function in you own classes, please check that it can still be used with its new logic.; The new and corrected bin correction behaviour is:. - `correctForBinSize`: multiply counts in each bin by the bin volume corresponding to the variables in `sumSet`; - `inverseBinCor`: divide counts in each bin by the bin volume corresponding to the variables *not* in `sumSet`. ### New fully parametrised Crystal Ball shape class. So far, the Crystal Ball distribution has been represented in RooFit only by the `RooCBShape` class, which has a Gaussian core and a single power-law tail on one side.; This release introduces [`RooCrystalBall`](https://root.cern/doc/v624/classRooCrystalBall.html), which implements some common generalizations of the Crystal Ball shape:. - symmetric or asymmetric power-law tails on both sides; - different width parameters for the left and right sides of the Gaussian core. The new `RooCrystalBall` class can substitute the `RooDSCBShape` and `RooSDSCBShape`, which were passed around in the community. ## 2D Graphics Libraries. - Add the method `AddPoint`to `TGraph(x,y)` and `TGraph2D(x,y,z)`, equivalent to `SetPoint(g->GetN(),x,y)`and `SetPoint(g->GetN(),x,y,z)`; - Option `E0` draws error bars and markers are drawn for bins with 0 contents.

Once a logging implementation has been initialized, it can be ""stopped"" by; finalizing the implementation through the ``__xray_log_finalize()`` function.; The finalization routine is the opposite of the initialization. When finalized,; an implementation's data can be cleared out through the; ``__xray_log_flushLog()`` function. For implementations that support in-memory; processing, these should register an iterator function to provide access to the; data via the ``__xray_log_set_buffer_iterator(...)`` which allows code calling; the ``__xray_log_process_buffers(...)`` function to deal with the data in; memory. All of this is better explained in the ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` header. Basic Mode; ----------. XRay supports a basic logging mode which will trace the application's; execution, and periodically append to a single log. This mode can be; installed/enabled by setting ``xray_mode=xray-basic`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS``; environment variable. Combined with ``patch_premain=true`` this can allow for; tracing applications from start to end. Like all the other modes installed through ``__xray_log_select_mode(...)``, the; implementation can be configured through the ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``; function, providing the mode string and the flag options. Basic-mode specific; defaults can be provided in the ``XRAY_BASIC_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Flight Data Recorder Mode; -------------------------. XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a; fixed amount of memory's worth of events. Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode works; very much like a plane's ""black box"" which keeps recording data to memory in a; fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data available; programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed.

Interface to TFoam adaptive MC sampler added; RooFit can now use the TFoam adaptive MC sampler for event generation of p.d.f.s that; do not have an internal generator. The TFoam generator adaptively subdivides the; observable space and is generally more efficient both warmup and generation than the original; RooAcceptReject algorithm. In its current interface in RooFit, TFoam cannot; handle problems yet with discrete observables or conditional observables. For those problems; the original RooAcceptReject generator is still used. The choice of MC sampling algorithm can be steered through class RooNumGenConfig, which; is similar in style and structure, to RooNumIntConfig which configures the choice of; numeric integration algorithm. A new tutorial macro rf902_numgenconfig.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of the steering. A macro that demonstrates of the power of these newly interface numeric algorithms is provided at the; end of the RooFit section of the release notes. Optional persistent caching of numeric integrals; For p.d.f.s with numeric integrals that remain difficult or very time consuming,; a new persistent caching technique is now available that allows to precalculate; these integrals and store their values for future use. This technique works transparently; for any p.d.f. stored in a RooWorkspace. One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.; In the first case, the value is simply stored. In cases with one or two floating parameters; a grid (histogram) of integral values is stored, which are interpolated to return integral; values for each value of the parameters.

As currently implemented, RewriteStatepointsForGC must be; run after SSA construction (i.e. mem2ref). RewriteStatepointsForGC will ensure that appropriate base pointers are listed; for every relocation created. It will do so by duplicating code as needed to; propagate the base pointer associated with each pointer being relocated to; the appropriate safepoints. The implementation assumes that the following; IR constructs produce base pointers: loads from the heap, addresses of global; variables, function arguments, function return values. Constant pointers (such; as null) are also assumed to be base pointers. In practice, this constraint; can be relaxed to producing interior derived pointers provided the target; collector can find the associated allocation from an arbitrary interior; derived pointer. By default RewriteStatepointsForGC passes in ``0xABCDEF00`` as the statepoint; ID and ``0`` as the number of patchable bytes to the newly constructed; ``gc.statepoint``. These values can be configured on a per-callsite; basis using the attributes ``""statepoint-id""`` and; ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""``. If a call site is marked with a; ``""statepoint-id""`` function attribute and its value is a positive; integer (represented as a string), then that value is used as the ID; of the newly constructed ``gc.statepoint``. If a call site is marked; with a ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""`` function attribute and its; value is a positive integer, then that value is used as the 'num patch; bytes' parameter of the newly constructed ``gc.statepoint``. The; ``""statepoint-id""`` and ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""`` attributes; are not propagated to the ``gc.statepoint`` call or invoke if they; could be successfully parsed.

If the; pointer hold the address of an object which in embedded in another; object (as opposed to being pointed to by a pointer), the object will be; duplicate at read time. To avoid this, make the pointer a transient data; member. ### Motivation for the TRef Class. If the object is split into several files or into several branches of; one or more `TTrees`, standard C++ pointers cannot be used because each; I/O operation will write the referenced objects, and multiple copies; will exist. In addition, if the pointer is read before the referenced; object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address; these limitations, ROOT offers the **`TRef`** class. **`TRef`** allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in; a different file. **`TRef`** also supports the complex situation where a; **`TFile`** is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different; machine. When a **`TRef`** is read before its referenced object, it is; null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the **`TRef`** points to; it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by **`TRef`** in; the case it is read before its reference object (see""Action on Demand""; below). ### Using TRef. A **`TRef`** is a lightweight object pointing to any **`TObject`**. This; object can be used instead of normal C++ pointers in case:. - The referenced object R and the pointer P are not written to the; same file. - P is read before R. - R and P are written to different Tree branches. Below is a line from the example in `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx.`. ``` {.cpp}; TRef fLastTrack; //pointer to last track; ...; Track *track = (Track*)fTracks->ConstructedAt(fNtrack++);; track->Set(random);; // Save reference to last Track in the collection of Tracks; fLastTrack = track;; ```.

It should even be possible for a completely; different compilation technology to provide a different libLTO that works with; their object files and the standard linker tool. ``lto_module_t``; ----------------. A non-native object file is handled via an ``lto_module_t``. The following; functions allow the linker to check if a file (on disk or in a memory buffer) is; a file which libLTO can process:. .. code-block:: c. lto_module_is_object_file(const char*); lto_module_is_object_file_for_target(const char*, const char*); lto_module_is_object_file_in_memory(const void*, size_t); lto_module_is_object_file_in_memory_for_target(const void*, size_t, const char*). If the object file can be processed by ``libLTO``, the linker creates a; ``lto_module_t`` by using one of:. .. code-block:: c. lto_module_create(const char*); lto_module_create_from_memory(const void*, size_t). and when done, the handle is released via. .. code-block:: c. lto_module_dispose(lto_module_t). The linker can introspect the non-native object file by getting the number of; symbols and getting the name and attributes of each symbol via:. .. code-block:: c. lto_module_get_num_symbols(lto_module_t); lto_module_get_symbol_name(lto_module_t, unsigned int); lto_module_get_symbol_attribute(lto_module_t, unsigned int). The attributes of a symbol include the alignment, visibility, and kind.

This release now supports building with C++17 enabled using either libstdc++ or; libc++. This requires Clang >= 5.0, or GCC >= 7.3.0. At the date of this; release, GCC 7.2.0 still does not provide full support to compile ROOT with C++17. ## Removed interfaces. The following interfaces have been removed, after deprecation in v6.10. - Remove the deprecated `TSelectorCint.h` and `TSelectorCint.cxx`.; - Remove the deprecated `Riosfwd.h` and `Rtypeinfo.h`.; - `TTreeReader::SetLastEntry()` was replaced by `TTreeReader::SetEntriesRange()`. ## Core Libraries. - Added support for XCode 9 and MacOS High Sierra.; - When invoking root with the ""-t"" argument, ROOT enables thread-safety and,; if configured, implicit multithreading within ROOT.; - `NULL` is not defined by `Rtypes.h` anymore. Instead, its definition is expected to be; provided by `Rtype.h`'s `#include` of `stddef.h`.; - ROOT now supports dictionaries, autoload and autoparse for classes with template parameter packs.; - std::make_unique has been backported; - If a class overloads TObject::Hash, this derived class should also add; ```; ROOT::CallRecursiveRemoveIfNeeded(*this); ```; Oth",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md:1251,release,release,1251,README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,1,['release'],['release']

See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines. Different tools have; different ways of loading dynamic pass plugins. For example, ``opt; -load-pass-plugin=path/to/plugin.so`` loads a pass plugin into ``opt``. For; information on writing a pass plugin, see :doc:`WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass`. Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached.

There are only two alternatives: precompile headers into LLVM bitcode and; distribute those or provide a restricted set of headers.; Precompiled headers (and modules) were never designed to be portable and; relocatable, however, thus that may not be the panacea it seems.; A restricted set of headers is some work, but cppyy can operate on abstract; interface classes just fine (including Python-side cross-inheritance). `Large deployment`; ------------------.

Deployability,"nu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/Developer-Options.html>`_. There are two ways to configure multilib in Clang: hard-coded or via a; configuration file. Hard-coded Multilib; ===================. The available libraries can be hard-coded in Clang. Typically this is done; using the ``MultilibBuilder`` interface in; ``clang/include/clang/Driver/MultilibBuilder.h``.; There are many examples of this in ``lib/Driver/ToolChains/Gnu.cpp``.; The remainder of this document will not focus on this type of multilib. EXPERIMENTAL Multilib via configuration file; ============================================. Some Clang toolchains support loading multilib configuration from a; ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file. A ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file specifies which multilib variants are; available, their relative location, what compilation options were used to build; them, and the criteria by which they are selected. Multilib processing; ===================. Clang goes through the following steps to use multilib from a configuration; file:. #. Normalize command line options. Clang can accept the same; information via different options - for example,; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -march=armv7-m`` and; ``--target=armv7m-none-eabi`` are equivalent.; Clang normalizes the command line before passing them to the multilib system.; To see what flags are emitted for a given set of command line options, use; the ``-print-multi-flags-experimental`` command line option; along with the rest of the options you want to use.; #. Load ``multilib.yaml`` from sysroot.; #. Generate additional flags. ``multilib.yaml`` contains a ``Mappings`` section,; which specifies how to generate additional flags based on the flags derived; from command line options. Flags are matched using regular expressions.; These regular expressions shall use the POSIX extended regular expression; syntax.; #. Match flags against multilib variants.

Deployability,"nvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###. The M processor $\mbox{MINOS}$ (MnMinos, see [api:minos]) was; probably the first, and may still be the only, generally available; program to calculate parameter errors taking into account both parameter; correlations and non-linearities. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error intervals; are in general asymmetric, and may be expensive to calculate,; especially if there are a lot of free parameters and the problem is very; non-linear. $\mbox{MINOS}$ can only operate after a good minimum has already; been found, and the error matrix has been calculated, so the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis will normally follow a; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ minimization. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error for a; given parameter is defined as the change in the value of that parameter; which causes ${\displaystyle F'}$ to increase by the amount; FCNBase::up(), where ${\displaystyle F'}$ is the minimum of; $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to all *oth",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:17354,release,release,17354,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['release'],['release']

This tool can be used to help identify bottlenecks in analysis runtimes, by providing time and throughput measurements when reading ROOT files via file systems or XRootD. More detailed information can be found in the tool's help information. To see help information, install and source a recent enough version of ROOT, and run the command `rootreadspeed --help` in your terminal. ### Example usage of the tool:. ```console; $ rootreadspeed --files <local-folder>/File1.root xrootd://<url-folder>/File2.root --trees Events --all-branches --threads 8; ```. ## Core Libraries. ### Interpreter. #### Support for profiling/debugging interpreted/JITted code. This version of ROOT adds an LLVM JIT event listener to create perf map files; during runtime. This allows profiling of interpreted/JITted code generated by; cling. Instead of function addresses, the perf data will contain full function; names. In addition, stack frame pointers are enabled in JITted code, so full; stack traces can be generated. Debugging is aided by switching off optimisations; and adding frame pointers for better stack traces. However, since both have a; runtime cost, they are disabled by default.

These steps assume that you have a series of commits that; you have not posted for review, but can be adapted to update existing reviews. * git interactive rebase back to the first commit you want to upload for review::. git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits you have written>. * Mark all commits for editing by changing ""pick"" to ""edit"" in the instructions; git shows.; * Start the rebase (usually by writing and closing the instructions).; * For the first commit:. - Upload the current commit for a review (with ``arc diff`` or the web; interface). - Continue to the next commit with ``git rebase --continue``. * For the rest:. - Add the ""Depends on..."" line using ``git commit --amend``. - Upload for review. - Continue the rebase. * Once the rebase is complete, you've created your patch series. .. _finding",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Phabricator.rst:7483,patch,patches,7483,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Phabricator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Phabricator.rst,1,['patch'],['patches']

When you open a pull-request, some automation will add a comment and; notify different member of the projects depending on the component you; changed.; Within a few days, someone should start the review. They may add; themselves as a reviewer, or simply start leaving comments. You'll get; another email any time the review is updated. The details are in the; `https://llvm.org/docs/CodeReview/ <https://llvm.org/docs/CodeReview.html>`__. Comments; ~~~~~~~~. The reviewer can leave comments on the change, and you can reply. Some; comments are attached to specific lines, and appear interleaved with the; code. You can either reply to these, or address them and mark them as; ""done"". Note that in-line replies are **not** sent straight away! They; become ""draft"" comments and you must click ""Submit"" at the bottom of the; page. Updating your change; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. If you make changes in response to a reviewer's comments, simply update; your branch with more commits and push to your fork. It may be a good; idea to answer the comments from the reviewer explicitly. Accepting a revision; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. When the reviewer is happy with the change, they will **Accept** the; revision. They may leave some more minor comments that you should; address, but at this point the review is complete. It's time to get it; merged!. Commit by proxy; ---------------. As this is your first change, you won't have access to merge it; yourself yet. The reviewer **doesn't know this**, so you need to tell; them! Leave a message on the review like:. Thanks @somellvmdev.

Deployability,"o that expansion order relative to other existing; substitutions is preserved. The following properties apply to both the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:``; directives:. - **Substitution name**: In the directive, whitespace immediately before or; after ``%{name}`` is optional and discarded. ``%{name}`` must start with; ``%{``, it must end with ``}``, and the rest must start with a letter or; underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and; colons. This syntax has a few advantages:. - It is impossible for ``%{name}`` to contain sequences that are special in; python's ``re.sub`` patterns. Otherwise, attempting to specify; ``%{name}`` as a substitution pattern in a lit configuration file could; produce confusing expansions.; - The braces help avoid the possibility that another substitution's pattern; will match part of ``%{name}`` or vice-versa, producing confusing; expansions. However, the patterns of substitutions defined by lit; configuration files and by lit itself are not restricted to this form, so; overlaps are still theoretically possible. - **Substitution value**: The value includes all text from the first; non-whitespace character after ``=`` to the last non-whitespace character. If; there is no non-whitespace character after ``=``, the value is the empty; string. Escape sequences that can appear in python ``re.sub`` replacement; strings are treated as plain text in the value.; - **Line continuations**: If the last non-whitespace character on the line after; ``:`` is ``\``, then the next directive must use the same directive keyword; (e.g., ``DEFINE:``) , and it is an error if there is no additional directive.; That directive serves as a continuation. That is, before following the rules; above to parse the text after ``:`` in either directive, lit joins that text; together to form a single directive, replaces the ``\`` with a single space,; and removes any other whitespace that is now adjacent to that space.

Histograms use the current style ***`gStyle`***, which is the global; object of class **`TStyle`**. To change the current style for; histograms, the **`TStyle`** class provides a multitude of methods; ranging from setting the fill color to the axis tick marks. Here are; a few examples:. ``` {.cpp}; void SetHistFillColor(Color_t color = 1); void SetHistFillStyle(Style_t styl = 0); void SetHistLineColor(Color_t color = 1); void SetHistLineStyle(Style_t styl = 0); void SetHistLineWidth(Width_t width = 1); ```. When you change the current style and would like to propagate the; change to a previously created histogram you can call; **`TH1`**`::UseCurrentStyle()`. You will need to call; `UseCurrentStyle()` on each histogram. When reading many histograms; from a file and you wish to update them to the current style, you can; use ***`gROOT`***`::ForceStyle` and all histograms read after this; call will be updated to use the current style. See ""Graphics and the; Graphical User Interface"". When a histogram is automatically created; as a result of a **`TTree`**`::Draw` , the style of the histogram is; inherited from the tree attributes and the current style is ignored.; The tree attributes are the ones set in the current **`TStyle`** at; the time the tree was created. You can change the existing tree to use; the current style, by calling **`TTree`**`::UseCurrentStyle()` . ### Draw Options. The following draw options are supported on all histogram classes:. - ""`AXIS`"": Draw only the axis. - ""`HIST`"": When a histogram has errors, it is visualized by default; with error bars. To visualize it without errors use `HIST`; together with the required option (e.g. ""`HIST SAME C`""). - ""`SAME`"": Superimpose on previous picture in the same pad. - ""`CYL`"": Use cylindrical coordinates. - ""`POL`"": Use polar coordinates. - ""`SPH`"": ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md:16070,update,update,16070,documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

Class RooMultivarGaussian implements analytical; integration as well as analytical partial integrals over the first 31 dimensions (if you have; that many) and implements in effect internal generation strategy for its observables. A new tutorial macro rf608_fitresultaspdf.C has been added to illustrate the use MV Gaussians constructed from a RooFitResult; Improved functionality of RooFFTConvPdf; The FFT convolution operator p.d.f. class RooFFTConvPdf has been substantially upgraded; for improved performance has several new options. For the overflow buffering, which aims to reduce cylical spillover from the FFT convolution,; a choice of three algorithms is now provided:. Extend the p.d.f. somewhat beyond its original domain (the new default); Fill the buffer 50/50 with the value of the p.d.f at the upper/lower bound of the convolution observable (the previous default); Mirror the p.d.f. over the boundary. The new default algorithm provides a more sensible result for p.d.f.s with significant; spillover issues, provided that the p.d.f. can be continuated beyond its original domain.; Convolution in non-observables is also explicitly supported now. One can e.g. construct a p.d.f; of the form G(x) = Int[dy] ( F(x,y) (*) H(y) ).

The; ``releaseMemory`` virtual method is the way to do this. If you are writing an analysis or any other pass that retains a significant; amount of state (for use by another pass which ""requires"" your pass and uses; the :ref:`getAnalysis <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysis>` method) you should; implement ``releaseMemory`` to, well, release the memory allocated to maintain; this internal state.

You want to be able to do all this, and, provide; feedback to the user. This is where pass registration comes into play.

JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping). Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail.

This allows the context to track/hold memory allocations and; react to the newly emitted definitions. In ORC this is used to update the; ``ExecutionSession`` instance's dependence graph, which may result in; these symbols (and possibly others) becoming *Ready* if all of their; dependencies have also been emitted. .. _passes:. Passes; ------. JITLink passes are ``std::function<Error(LinkGraph&)>`` instances. They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``.

A stage1 build is a standard; build using the compiler installed on the host, and a stage2 build is built; using the stage1 compiler. This nomenclature holds up to more stages too. In; general a stage*n* build is built using the output from stage*n-1*. Apple Clang Builds (A More Complex Bootstrap); =============================================. Apple's Clang builds are a slightly more complicated example of the simple; bootstrapping scenario. Apple Clang is built using a 2-stage build. The stage1 compiler is a host-only compiler with some options set. The stage1; compiler is a balance of optimization vs build time because it is a throwaway.; The stage2 compiler is the fully optimized compiler intended to ship to users. Setting up these compilers requires a lot of options. To simplify the; configuration the Apple Clang build settings are contained in CMake Cache files.; You can build an Apple Clang compiler using the following commands:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/Apple-stage1.cmake <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage2-distribution. This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations.

It is possible to use the newest SDK but still build a program that can run on; older versions of macOS and iOS by passing ``-mmacosx-version-min=`` /; ``-miphoneos-version-min=``. Before LLVM 5.0, when calling a function that exists only in the OS that's; newer than the target OS (as determined by the minimum deployment version),; programmers had to carefully check if the function exists at runtime, using; null checks for weakly-linked C functions, ``+class`` for Objective-C classes,; and ``-respondsToSelector:`` or ``+instancesRespondToSelector:`` for; Objective-C methods.

We don't change it too often,; but there are no specific promises. * Additions and changes to the IR should be reflected in; ``test/Bitcode/compatibility.ll``. * The current LLVM version supports loading any bitcode since version 3.0. * After each X.Y release, ``compatibility.ll`` must be copied to; ``compatibility-X.Y.ll``. The corresponding bitcode file should be assembled; using the X.Y build and committed as ``compatibility-X.Y.ll.bc``. * Newer releases can ignore features from older releases, but they cannot; miscompile them. For example, if nsw is ever replaced with something else,; dropping it would be a valid way to upgrade the IR. * Debug metadata is special in that it is currently dropped during upgrades. * Non-debug metadata is defined to be safe to drop, so a valid way to upgrade; it is to drop it.

Deployability,"ode generator; -----------------------------------------. The two pieces of the LLVM code generator are the high-level interface to the; code generator and the set of reusable components that can be used to build; target-specific backends. The two most important interfaces (:raw-html:`<tt>`; `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` and :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>`) are the only ones that are required to be defined for a; backend to fit into the LLVM system, but the others must be defined if the; reusable code generator components are going to be used. This design has two important implications. The first is that LLVM can support; completely non-traditional code generation targets. For example, the C backend; does not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of the other; standard components provided by the system. As such, it only implements these; two interfaces, and does its own thing. Note that C backend was removed from the; trunk since LLVM 3.1 release. Another example of a code generator like this is a; (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM to the GCC RTL form and uses; GCC to emit machine code for a target. This design also implies that it is possible to design and implement radically; different code generators in the LLVM system that do not make use of any of the; built-in components. Doing so is not recommended at all, but could be required; for radically different targets that do not fit into the LLVM machine; description model: FPGAs for example. .. _high-level design of the code generator:. The high-level design of the code generator; -------------------------------------------. The LLVM target-independent code generator is designed to support efficient and; quality code generation for standard register-based microprocessors.

Deployability,"odule editline ; The new module editline enhances the prompt, giving type and syntax feedback using e.g. colors.; Class names are highlighted blue when typed, indicating that it is known to ROOT.; Matching parenthesis pairs are highlighted green when typed, or when the cursor is moved to a bracket. This works for () {} and [] brackets.; Any mismatched brackets (those without a matching partner) will be highlighted red when typed or when the cursor is moved to the bracket.; Tab completion output is colored magenta to differentiate between tab completion output and user input.; All of the colors are configurable in the .rootrc file.; They can be specified as #rgb or #rrggbb or color names:; black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan or white.; They can be followed by an optional bold (alias light) or underlined.; Rint.ReverseColor allows to quickly toggle between the default ""light on dark"" (yes) instead of ""dark on light"" (no), depending on the terminal background.; An example configuration would be:. Rint.TypeColor: blue; Rint.BracketColor: bold green; Rint.BadBracketColor: underlined red; Rint.TabColor: magenta; Rint.PromptColor: black; Rint.ReverseColor: no.

For large MSF files, the stream directory (which describes the; block layout of each stream) may not fit entirely on a single block. As a; result, this extra layer of indirection is introduced, whereby this block; contains the list of blocks that the stream directory occupies, and the stream; directory itself can be stitched together accordingly. The number of; ``ulittle32_t``'s in this array is given by ``ceil(NumDirectoryBytes /; BlockSize)``. .. _msf_freeblockmap:. The Free Block Map; ==================. The Free Block Map (sometimes referred to as the Free Page Map, or FPM) is a; series of blocks which contains a bit flag for every block in the file. The; flag will be set to 0 if the block is in use, and 1 if the block is unused. Each file contains two FPMs, one of which is active at any given time. This; feature is designed to support incremental and atomic updates of the underlying; MSF file. While writing to an MSF file, if the active FPM is FPM1, you can; write your new modified bitfield to FPM2, and vice versa. Only when you commit; the file to disk do you need to swap the value in the SuperBlock to point to; the new ``FreeBlockMapBlock``. The Free Block Maps are stored as a series of single blocks throughout the file; at intervals of BlockSize. Because each FPM block is of size ``BlockSize``; bytes, it contains 8 times as many bits as an interval has blocks. This means; that the first block of each FPM refers to the first 8 intervals of the file; (the first 32768 blocks), the second block of each FPM refers to the next 8; blocks, and so on. This results in far more FPM blocks being present than are; required, but in order to maintain backwards compatibility the format must stay; this way.

This value; represents the inline assembler as a template string (containing the; instructions to emit), a list of operand constraints (stored as a string), a; flag that indicates whether or not the inline asm expression has side effects,; and a flag indicating whether the function containing the asm needs to align its; stack conservatively. The template string supports argument substitution of the operands using ""``$``""; followed by a number, to indicate substitution of the given register/memory; location, as specified by the constraint string. ""``${NUM:MODIFIER}``"" may also; be used, where ``MODIFIER`` is a target-specific annotation for how to print the; operand (See :ref:`inline-asm-modifiers`). A literal ""``$``"" may be included by using ""``$$``"" in the template. To include; other special characters into the output, the usual ""``\XX``"" escapes may be; used, just as in other strings. Note that after template substitution, the; resulting assembly string is parsed by LLVM's integrated assembler unless it is; disabled -- even when emitting a ``.s`` file -- and thus must contain assembly; syntax known to LLVM. LLVM also supports a few more substitutions useful for writing inline assembly:. - ``${:uid}``: Expands to a decimal integer unique to this inline assembly blob.; This substitution is useful when declaring a local label. Many standard; compiler optimizations, such as inlining, may duplicate an inline asm blob.; Adding a blob-unique identifier ensures that the two labels will not conflict; during assembly. This is used to implement `GCC's %= special format; string <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html>`_.; - ``${:comment}``: Expands to the comment character of the current target's; assembly dialect. This is usually ``#``, but many targets use other strings,; such as ``;``, ``//``, or ``!``.; - ``${:private}``: Expands to the assembler private label prefix.

Deployability,"ointer to an object to a C routine) in the abstract; machine model. At the moment, the best idea on how to approach this; involves an intrinsic or opaque function which hides the connection between; the reference value and the raw pointer. The problem is that having a; ptrtoint or inttoptr cast (which is common for such use cases) breaks the; rules used for inferring base pointers for arbitrary references when; lowering out of the abstract model to the explicit physical model. Note; that a frontend which lowers directly to the physical model doesn't have; any problems here. Objects on the Stack; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As noted above, the explicit lowering supports objects allocated on the; stack provided the collector can find a heap map given the stack address. The missing pieces are a) integration with rewriting (RS4GC) from the; abstract machine model and b) support for optionally decomposing on stack; objects so as not to require heap maps for them. The later is required; for ease of integration with some collectors. Lowering Quality and Representation Overhead; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The current statepoint lowering is known to be somewhat poor. In the very; long term, we'd like to integrate statepoints with the register allocator;; in the near term this is unlikely to happen. We've found the quality of; lowering to be relatively unimportant as hot-statepoints are almost always; inliner bugs.

In practice, this constraint; can be relaxed to producing interior derived pointers provided the target; collector can find the associated allocation from an arbitrary interior; derived pointer. By default RewriteStatepointsForGC passes in ``0xABCDEF00`` as the statepoint; ID and ``0`` as the number of patchable bytes to the newly constructed; ``gc.statepoint``. These values can be configured on a per-callsite; basis using the attributes ``""statepoint-id""`` and; ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""``. If a call site is marked with a; ``""statepoint-id""`` function attribute and its value is a positive; integer (represented as a string), then that value is used as the ID; of the newly constructed ``gc.statepoint``. If a call site is marked; with a ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""`` function attribute and its; value is a positive integer, then that value is used as the 'num patch; bytes' parameter of the newly constructed ``gc.statepoint``.

OpenACC Specific Changes; ------------------------; - OpenACC Implementation effort is beginning with semantic analysis and parsing; of OpenACC pragmas. The ``-fopenacc`` flag was added to enable these new,; albeit incomplete changes. The ``_OPENACC`` macro is currently defined to; ``1``, as support is too incomplete to update to a standards-required value.; - Added ``-fexperimental-openacc-macro-override``, a command line option to; permit overriding the ``_OPENACC`` macro to be any digit-only value specified; by the user, which permits testing the compiler against existing OpenACC; workloads in order to evaluate implementation progress. Target Specific Changes; -----------------------. AMDGPU Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Use pass-by-reference (byref) in stead of pass-by-value (byval) for struct; arguments in C ABI. Callee is responsible for allocating stack memory and; copying the value of the struct if modified. Note that AMDGPU backend still; supports byval for struct arguments.; - The default value for ``-mcode-object-version`` is now 5.; See `AMDHSA Code Object V5 Metadata <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#code-object-v5-metadata>`_; for more details.

This section will describe the main methods and algorithms used for; implementing the navigation features within the geometrical modeller.; This includes navigation queries at shape level, global geometrical; queries and optimization mechanisms. ### Finding the State Corresponding to a Location (x,y,z). For reminder, a geometry state is a ‘touchable' object in the geometry; hierarchy. It is represented by a path like: **/TOP\_1/A\_1/B\_3/C\_1**,; where **B\_3** for instance is a copy of volume **B** positioned inside; volume **A**. A state is always associated to a transformation matrix; **M** of the touchable with respect to the global reference frame; (obtained by piling-up all local transformations of nodes in the branch; with respect to their containers). The current state and the; corresponding global matrix are updated whenever the geometry depth is; modified. The global transformations corresponding to all nodes in the; current branch are kept in an array: (**MTOP\_1, MA\_1, MB\_3, ...**). ![Navigation in the geometry hierarchy](pictures/080001E6.png). The elementary operations for changing the state are:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoManager::CdUp();; TGeoManager::CdDown(i);; TGeoManager::CdTop(); ```. The current state accounting and global matrix handling after these; operations are depicted in the figure below. Now let us suppose that we; have a particle at position *P(x,y,z)*. The first thing needed for; transporting it is the current object our particle is into, so that we; can retrieve its material properties. This task is done by:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoNode *TGeoManager::FindNode(x,y,z); ```. Note that the current particle position can be set using; **`SetCurrentPosition(x,y,z)`** method of the manager class, in which; case **`FindNode()`** can be called without arguments.

The good part is: it will not send mail to; llvm-commit mailing list, patch reviewers, and all other subscribers, buildbot; will also run on every patch update:. ::. arc diff --draft HEAD~. If you later update your commit message, you need to add the `--verbatim`; option to have `arc` update the description on Phabricator:. ::. arc diff --edit --verbatim. .. _phabricator-request-review-web:.

DataFlowSanitizer's ABI list file is a :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`.; The pass treats every function in the ``uninstrumented`` category in the; ABI list file as conforming to the native ABI. Unless the ABI list contains; additional categories for those functions, a call to one of those functions; will produce a warning message, as the labelling behavior of the function; is unknown. The other supported categories are ``discard``, ``functional``; and ``custom``. * ``discard`` -- To the extent that this function writes to (user-accessible); memory, it also updates labels in shadow memory (this condition is trivially; satisfied for functions which do not write to user-accessible memory). Its; return value is unlabelled.; * ``functional`` -- Like ``discard``, except that the label of its return value; is the union of the label of its arguments.; * ``custom`` -- Instead of calling the function, a custom wrapper ``__dfsw_F``; is called, where ``F`` is the name of the function. This function may wrap; the original function or provide its own implementation. This category is; generally used for uninstrumentable functions which write to user-accessible; memory or which have more complex label propagation behavior.

The default value for all unspecified reflection parameters is zero. The ``NVVMReflect`` pass should be executed early in the optimization; pipeline, immediately after the link stage. The ``internalize`` pass is also; recommended to remove unused math functions from the resulting PTX. For an; input IR module ``module.bc``, the following compilation flow is recommended:. 1. Save list of external functions in ``module.bc``; 2. Link ``module.bc`` with ``libdevice.compute_XX.YY.bc``; 3. Internalize all functions not in list from (1); 4. Eliminate all unused internal functions; 5. Run ``NVVMReflect`` pass; 6.

Deployability,"on. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up; long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines; ending in ``\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in; ``\`` is found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one; execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the pipeline; to be executed. If any process in the pipeline fails, the entire line (and; test case) fails too. Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a ``.ll`` file:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llvm-dis > %t1; ; RUN: llvm-dis < %s.bc-13 > %t2; ; RUN: diff %t1 %t2. As with a Unix shell, the RUN lines permit pipelines and I/O; redirection to be used. There are some quoting rules that you must pay attention to when writing; your RUN lines. In general nothing needs to be quoted. :program:`lit` won't; strip off any quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value. In general, you should strive to keep your RUN lines as simple as possible,; using them only to run tools that generate textual output you can then examine.; The recommended way to examine output to figure out if the test passes is using; the :doc:`FileCheck tool <CommandG",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:9838,pipeline,pipeline,9838,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"ons older than 2.2 are not supported and will not work. Note; that one problem with 2.2 is that the shared library of the `Python`; interpreter core is not build by default and the '--enable-shared' flag; should thus be used when building `Python` from source. If the `Python`; interpreter that is installed on your system is too old, please obtain a; new version from <http://www.python.org>. Once configured, you continue the build process the normal way:. `$ make`. `$ make install`. After some time, a library called `libPyROOT.so` (or `libPyROOT.dll`, on; Windows) will be created in the; `$ROOTSYS/lib `(`$ROOTSYS/bin on Windows`) directory and a top Python; module, `ROOT.py`, will be copied into the same place. The final step is; to setup the shell environment, which is similar to what is described in; the chapter ‘Environment Settings'. Note that the `$ROOTSYS` entries are; probably already there if you followed the standard instructions, and; that the `PYTHONDIR` entries should be replaced as appropriate by your; choice at configuration time, or be left out if you had the; configuration script pick up them up from a default location. ### Using PyROOT. Since it is an extension module, the usage of `PyROOT` probably comes; naturally if you're used to Python. In general, `PyROOT` attempts to; allow working in both Python and ROOT style, and although it is; succeeding, it isn't perfect: there are edges. The following sections; explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch; out for. #### Access to ROOT Classes. Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be; loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06,; this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the; auto-loading mechanism through so-called `rootmap` files. Effectively,; this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly; available for import.

If approval is received very; quickly, a patch author may also elect to wait before committing (and this is; certainly considered polite for non-trivial patches). Especially given the; global nature of our community, this waiting time should be at least 24 hours.; Please also be mindful of weekends and major holidays. Our goal is to ensure community consensus around design decisions and; significant implementation choices, and one responsibility of a reviewer, when; providing an overall approval for a patch, is to be reasonably sure that such; consensus exists. If you're not familiar enough with the community to know,; then you shouldn't be providing final approval to commit. A reviewer providing; final approval should have commit access to the LLVM project. Every patch should be reviewed by at least one technical expert in the areas of; the project affected by the change. Splitting Requests and Conditional Acceptance; ---------------------------------------------. Reviewers may request certain aspects of a patch to be broken out into separate; patches for independent review. Reviewers may also accept a patch; conditioned on the author providing a follow-up patch addressing some; particular issue or concern (although no committed patch should leave the; project in a broken state). Moreover, reviewers can accept a patch conditioned on; the author applying some set of minor updates prior to committing, and when; applicable, it is polite for reviewers to do so. Don't Unintentionally Block a Review; ------------------------------------. If you review a patch, but don't intend for the review process to block on your; approval, please state that explicitly.

Using Ninja Build System; =======================================. Optionally you can use the `Ninja`_ build system instead of make. It is; aimed at making your builds faster. Currently this step will require; building Ninja from sources. To take advantage of using Clang Tools along with Ninja build you need; at least CMake 2.8.9. Clone the Ninja git repository and build Ninja from sources:. .. code-block:: console. $ git clone git://github.com/martine/ninja.git; $ cd ninja/; $ ./bootstrap.py. This will result in a single binary ``ninja`` in the current directory.; It doesn't require installation and can just be copied to any location; inside ``$PATH``, say ``/usr/local/bin/``:. .. code-block:: console. $ sudo cp ninja /usr/local/bin/; $ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/ninja. After doing all of this, you'll need to generate Ninja build files for; LLVM with CMake. You need to make a build directory and run CMake from; it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables in an interactive manner. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory.

The current implementation of `RVec` is based on LLVM's SmallVector, extracted; from the head of LLVM's repo around December 2020.; We are not tracking the upstream implementation. Compared to LLVM's SmallVectors:. - memory adoption capabilities have been added; - patches have been applied to make RVec work with (ROOT's version of) cppyy (notably `using` declarations had to be; lowered in the inheritance hierarchy for cppyy to pick them up); - `operator[](mask)` has been added, as well as several other ""numpy-like"" helper; functions (these latter ones are free functions); - logical operators `==`, `<`, `>` etc. return vectors rather than booleans; - the type of fSize and fCapacity is signed rather than unsigned, and fixed to 32 bits; - a number of minor patches have been applied for backward compatibility with the previous; implementation of RVec (which did not have a small buffer optimization and was implemented; in terms of `std::vector` with a custom allocator) and to make the code more consistent; with ROOT's coding conventions. ## RVec design. `SmallVectorBase`; - `fBeginX`; - `fSize`; - `fCapacity`. Basically the same as the corresponding LLVM class, with the template parameter removed: LLVM's SmallVectorBase; is templated over the type of fSize and fCapacity.

Use after Free Detection; ------------------------. The guarded allocation pool also provides use-after-free detection. Whenever a; sampled allocation is deallocated, we map its guarded slot as inaccessible. Any; memory accesses after deallocation will thus trigger the crash handler, and we; can provide useful information about the source of the error. Please note that the use-after-free detection for a sampled allocation is; transient. To keep memory overhead fixed while still detecting bugs, deallocated; slots are randomly reused to guard future allocations. Usage; =====. GWP-ASan already ships by default in the; `Scudo Hardened Allocator <https://llvm.org/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.html>`_,; so building with ``-fsanitize=scudo`` is the quickest and easiest way to try out; GWP-ASan. Options; -------. GWP-ASan's configuration is managed by the supporting allocator. We provide a; generic configuration management library that is used by Scudo. It allows; several aspects of GWP-ASan to be configured through the following methods:. - When the GWP-ASan library is compiled, by setting; ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS`` to the options string you want set by default.; If you're building GWP-ASan as part of a compiler-rt/LLVM build, add it during; cmake configure time (e.g. ``cmake ... -DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=""...""``). If; you're building GWP-ASan outside of compiler-rt, simply ensure that you; specify ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=""...""`` when building; ``optional/options_parser.cpp``). - By defining a ``__gwp_asan_default_options`` function in one's program that; returns the options string to be parsed. Said function must have the following; prototype: ``extern ""C"" const char* __gwp_asan_default_options(void)``, with a; default visibility.

We indicate; to the system which argument corresponds to which data member of the; class. ### Executing Events when a Cursor Passes on Top of an Object. This paragraph is for class designers. When a class is designed, it is; often desirable to include drawing methods for it. We will have a more; extensive discussion about this, but drawing an object in a canvas or a; pad consists in ""attaching"" the object to that pad. When one uses; `object.Draw()`, the object is NOT painted at this moment. It is only; attached to the active pad or canvas. Another method should be provided for the object to be painted, the; `Paint()` method. This is all explained in the next paragraph. As well; as `Draw()` and `Paint()`, other methods may be provided by the designer; of the class. When the mouse is moved or a button pressed/released, the; **`TCanvas`** function named `HandleInput()` scans the list of objects; in all it's pads and for each object calls some standard methods to make; the object react to the event (mouse movement, click or whatever). The second one is `DistancetoPrimitive(px,py)`. This function computes a; ""distance"" to an object from the mouse position at the pixel position; (`px`, `py`, see definition at the end of this paragraph) and returns; this distance in pixel units. The selected object will be the one with; the shortest computed distance. To see how this works, select the; ""`Event Status`"" item in the canvas ""`Options`"" menu. ROOT will display; one status line showing the picked object. If the picked object is, for; example, a histogram, the status line indicates the name of the; histogram, the position `x,y` in histogram coordinates, the channel; number and the channel content. It is nice for the canvas to know what the closest object from the mouse; is, but it's even nicer to be able to make this object react.

Once; all parameters are added to MnUserParameters, they can fix a parameter or; put limits on another one before handing them over to Minuit for; minimization. ### What the user can supply ###. Optionally the user can supply their own gradient calculator by; implementing the FCNGradientBase interface or supply a full covariance; matrix for input if one is available. The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##. Two use cases are addressed for minimization:. - The user just wants the function to be minimized in one go. - The user wants to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ in several; minimization steps, re-using the result of the preceeding; minimization in the next step and change parameters in between; (fix/release/put limits on them, etc.). How M minimizations can be performed is shown in [example:main]. ### Direct usage of minimizers ###. Minimizers such as the VariableMetricMinimizer are designed as; state-less minimization engines, which means that they do not depend on; the current function and its parameters. Any $\mbox{FCN}$ function; can be minimized with the same minimizer. The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:33768,release,release,33768,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['release'],['release']

It is highly recommended to follow the dependency chain when manually; upgrading packages individually (i.e. ``cppyy-cling``, ``cppyy-backend``,; ``CPyCppyy`` if on CPython, and then finally ``cppyy``), because upstream; packages expose headers that are used by the ones downstream.; Of course, if only building for a patch/point release, there is no need to; re-install the full chain (or follow the order).; Always run the local updates from the package directories (i.e. where the; ``setup.py`` file is located), as some tools rely on the package structure.

As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools.

Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list.

When the debugger; attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in this function and associates a; special handler with it. Once MCJIT calls the registration function, the; debugger catches the breakpoint signal, loads the new object file from the; inferior's memory and resumes execution. This way it can obtain debug; information for pure in-memory object files. GDB Version; ===========. In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is; available on most modern distributions of Linux. The version of GDB that; Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while. LLDB Version; ============. Due to a regression in release 6.0, LLDB didn't support JITed code debugging for; a while. The bug was fixed in mainline recently, so that debugging JITed ELF; objects should be possible again from the upcoming release 12.0 on. On macOS the; feature must be enabled explicitly using the ``plugin.jit-loader.gdb.enable``; setting. Debugging MCJIT-ed code; =======================. The emerging MCJIT component of LLVM allows full debugging of JIT-ed code with; GDB. This is due to MCJIT's ability to use the MC emitter to provide full; DWARF debugging information to GDB. Note that lli has to be passed the ``--jit-kind=mcjit`` flag to JIT the code; with MCJIT instead of the newer ORC JIT. Example; -------.

Deployability,"ort; =============. .. caution::. This is an **experimental** feature, available starting with release; 2.4.0.; It is still incomplete (see listing below) and has only been tested on; Linux on x86_64. Numba `is a JIT compiler`_ for Python functions that can be statically typed; based on their input arguments.; Since C++ objects are always statically typed and already implemented at the; machine level, they can be dynamically integrated into the Numba type tracing; and lowering by exposing type details through C++ reflection at runtime. JIT-compiling traces of mixed Python/bound C++ code reduces, and in some; cases removes, the overhead of boxing/unboxing native data into their Python; proxies and vice versa.; It can also reduce or remove temporaries, especially for template; expressions.; Thus, there can be significant speedups for mixed code, beyond the Numba; compilation of Python code itself.; The current implementation integrates compiled C++ through function pointers,; object pointers, and pointer offsets, into the intermediate representation; (IR) as generated by Numba.; A future version may integrate Cling-generated IR directly into Numba IR (or; vice versa), e.g. if the C++ code is exposed from (precompiled) headers.; This would allow inlining of C++ code into Numba traces, for further; expected speedups. Why Numba?; ----------. The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; would otherwise certainly",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:959,integrat,integrates,959,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrates']

Deployability,"ory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`.

Deployability,"other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; printout from the $\mbox{MINOS}$ result to be able to determine; whether the results are reliable or not. ## Fixing and releasing parameters ##. When M needs to be guided to the ""right"" minimum, often the best way to; do this is with the methods e.g. MnMigrad::fix(...) and; MnMigrad::release(...). That is, suppose you have a problem with ten; free parameters, and when you minimize with respect to all at once, M; goes to an unphysical solution characterized by an unphysical or; unwanted value of parameter number four. One way to avoid this is to fix; parameter four at a ""good"" value (not necessarily the best, since you; presumably don't know that yet), and minimize with respect to the; others. Then release parameter four and minimize again. If the problem; admits a ""good"" physical solution, you will normally find it this way.; If it doesn't work, you may see what is wrong by the following sequence; (where $\mbox{xxx}$ is the expected physical value for parameter; four):. MnMigrad migrad(...);; migrad.setValue(4, xxx);; migrad.fix(4);; FunctionMinimum min = migrad();; migrad.release(4);; MnScan scan(...);; std::vector<std::pair<double, double> > points = scan(4);. where $\mbox{SCAN}$ gives you a picture of $\mbox{FCN}$ as a; function of parameter four alone, the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:66655,release,release,66655,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['release'],['release']

Examples include: fixing build breakage, reverting; obviously broken patches, documentation/comment changes, any other minor; changes. Avoid committing formatting- or whitespace-only changes outside of; code you plan to make subsequent changes to. Also, try to separate; formatting or whitespace changes from functional changes, either by; correcting the format first (ideally) or afterward.

This section mostly applies to Linux and older BSDs. On macOS, you should; have a sufficiently modern Xcode, or you will likely need to upgrade until you; do. Windows does not have a ""system compiler"", so you must install either Visual; Studio 2019 (or later), or a recent version of mingw64. FreeBSD 10.0 and newer; have a modern Clang as the system compiler. However, some Linux distributions and some other or older BSDs sometimes have; extremely old versions of GCC. These steps attempt to help you upgrade you; compiler even on such a system. However, if at all possible, we encourage you; to use a recent version of a distribution with a modern system compiler that; meets these requirements. Note that it is tempting to install a prior; version of Clang and libc++ to be the host compiler, however libc++ was not; well tested or set up to build on Linux until relatively recently. As; a consequence, this guide suggests just using libstdc++ and a modern GCC as the; initial host in a bootstrap, and then using Clang (and potentially libc++). The first step is to get a recent GCC toolchain installed.

Evaluated to 1.000000. Whoa, how does the JIT know about sin and cos? The answer is surprisingly; simple: The KaleidoscopeJIT has a straightforward symbol resolution rule that; it uses to find symbols that aren't available in any given module: First; it searches all the modules that have already been added to the JIT, from the; most recent to the oldest, to find the newest definition. If no definition is; found inside the JIT, it falls back to calling ""``dlsym(""sin"")``"" on the; Kaleidoscope process itself. Since ""``sin``"" is defined within the JIT's; address space, it simply patches up calls in the module to call the libm; version of ``sin`` directly. But in some cases this even goes further:; as sin and cos are names of standard math functions, the constant folder; will directly evaluate the function calls to the correct result when called; with constants like in the ""``sin(1.0)``"" above. In the future we'll see how tweaking this symbol resolution rule can be used to; enable all sorts of useful features, from security (restricting the set of; symbols available to JIT'd code), to dynamic code generation based on symbol; names, and even lazy compilation. One immediate benefit of the symbol resolution rule is that we can now extend; the language by writing arbitrary C++ code to implement operations.

A **`mutex`**, or mutual exclusion lock, is a synchronization object; with two states locked and unlocked. A mutex is usually used to ensure; that only one thread at a time executes some critical section of code.; Before entering a critical section, a thread will attempt to lock the; mutex, which guards that section. If the mutex is already locked, the; thread will block until the mutex is unlocked, at which time it will; lock the mutex, execute the critical section, and unlock the mutex upon; leaving the critical section. A **`semaphore`** is a synchronization mechanism that starts out; initialized to some positive value. A thread may ask to wait on a; semaphore in which case the thread blocks until the value of the; semaphore is positive. At that time the semaphore count is decremented; and the thread continues. When a thread releases semaphore, the; semaphore count is incremented. Counting semaphores are useful for; coordinating access to a limited pool of some resource. **`Readers/Writer Lock`** - a multiple-reader, single-writer lock is one; that allows simultaneous read access by many threads while restricting; write access to only one thread at a time. When any thread holds the; lock for reading, other threads can also acquire the lock reading. If; one thread holds the lock for writing, or is waiting to acquire the lock; for writing, other threads must wait to acquire the lock for either; reading or writing.

This will fill in the `math/minuit2` directory with all the files needed for Minuit2, copied from the corresponding ROOT files, as part of the configure step.; At this point, you could continue to build (using `make`). Note that the CMake option `minuit2_inroot` will automatically be set to `ON` if you are inside the ROOT source tree. Setting `minuit2_standalone` requires that this be inside the ROOT source tree. As always, any manual setting of a cached variable in CMake will be remembered as long as the `CMakeCache.txt` file is not removed. Remember that after building a tarball or a binary package you should remove the copied files using:. ```bash; make purge; ```. Otherwise git shows the file as untracked, unless you explicitly remove their tracking yourself with a .gitignore file. ## Building a tarball. Minuit2 standalone also has support for CPack to make installers for different platforms. To build a source package:. ```bash; make package_source; ```. This will create a source file in several formats that you can distribute. Reminder: You **must** have used `-Dminuit2_standalone=ON` when you configured CMake, or many of the files will be missing. ## Building a binary. To build a binary package (add other generators with `-G`):; ```bash; make; make package; ```. ## Maintenance. If new files are needed by Minuit2 due to additions to [ROOT], they should be added to the source files lists in `src/Math/CMakeLists.txt` and `src/Minuit2/CMakeLists.txt` (depending on if it's a new Math or Minuit2 requirement). For testing, the main `test/CMakeLists.txt` is used by ROOT, and the `test/*/CMakeLists.txt` files are used by the standalone build. ## How it works.

The details are in the `developer; policy; document <https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#obtaining-commit-access>`__. With great power; ----------------. Actually, this would be a great time to read the rest of the `developer; policy <https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html>`__, too. At minimum,; you need to be subscribed to the relevant commits list before landing; changes (e.g. llvm-commits@lists.llvm.org), as discussion often happens; there if a new patch causes problems. Post-commit errors; ------------------. Once your change is submitted it will be picked up by automated build; bots that will build and test your patch in a variety of configurations. You can see all configurations and their current state in a waterfall; view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/waterfall. The waterfall view is good; to get a general overview over the tested configurations and to see; which configuration have been broken for a while. The console view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/console helps to get a; better understanding of the build results of a specific patch. If you; want to follow along how your change is affecting the build bots, **this; should be the first place to look at** - the colored bubbles correspond; to projects in the waterfall. If you see a broken build, do not despair - some build bots are; continuously broken; if your change broke the build, you will see a red; bubble in the console view, while an already broken build will show an; orange bubble. Of course, even when the build was already broken, a new; change might introduce a hidden new failure. | When you want to see more details how a specific build is broken,; click the red bubble.; | If post-commit error logs confuse you, do not worry too much -; everybody on the project is aware that this is a bit unwieldy, so; expect people to jump in and help you understand w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MyFirstTypoFix.rst:13943,configurat,configurations,13943,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MyFirstTypoFix.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MyFirstTypoFix.rst,2,['configurat'],"['configuration', 'configurations']"

Stand-alone builds allow you to build a sub-project against a pre-built; version of the clang or llvm libraries that is already present on your; system. You can use the source code from a standard checkout of the llvm-project; (as described above) to do stand-alone builds, but you may also build; from a :ref:`sparse checkout<workflow-multicheckout-nocommit>` or from the; tarballs available on the `releases <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/>`_; page. For stand-alone builds, you must have an llvm install that is configured; properly to be consumable by stand-alone builds of the other projects.; This could be a distro provided LLVM install, or you can build it yourself,; like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/llvm -B $builddir \; -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON \; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix \; < other options >. ninja -C $builddir install. Once llvm is installed, to configure a project for a stand-alone build, invoke CMake like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/$subproj \; -B $buildir_subproj \; -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=/path/to/lit \; -DLLVM_ROOT=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix. Notice that:. * The stand-alone build needs to happen in a folder that is not the; original folder where LLVMN was built; (`$builddir!=$builddir_subproj`).; * ``LLVM_ROOT`` should point to the prefix of your llvm installation,; so for example, if llvm is installed into ``/usr/bin`` and; ``/usr/lib64``, then you should pass ``-DLLVM_ROOT=/usr/``.; * Both the ``LLVM_ROOT`` and ``LLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT`` options are; required to do stand-alone builds for all sub-projects. Additional; required options for each sub-project can be found in the table; below. The ``check-$subproj`` and ``install`` build targets are supported for the; sub-projects listed in the table below. ============ ======================== ====",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst:6074,install,install,6074,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,1,['install'],['install']
Deployability,"outu.be/C5Y977rLqpw. A good way for new contributors to increase their knowledge of the code base is; to review code. It is perfectly acceptable to review code and explicitly; defer to others for approval decisions. Experts Should Review Code; --------------------------. If you are an expert in an area of the compiler affected by a proposed patch,; then you are highly encouraged to review the code. If you are a relevant code; owner, and no other experts are reviewing a patch, you must either help arrange; for an expert to review the patch or review it yourself. Code Reviews, Speed, and Reciprocity; ------------------------------------. Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you might hope, especially for; larger features. Common ways to speed up review times for your patches are:. * Review other people's patches. If you help out, everybody will be more; willing to do the same for you; goodwill is our currency.; * Ping the patch. If it is urgent, provide reasons why it is important to you to; get this patch landed and ping it every couple of days. If it is; not urgent, the common courtesy ping rate is one week. Remember that you're; asking for valuable time from other professional developers.; * Ask for help on IRC. Developers on IRC will be able to either help you; directly, or tell you who might be a good reviewer.; * Split your patch into multiple smaller patches that build on each other. The; smaller your patch is, the higher the probability that somebody will take a quick; look at it. When doing this, it is helpful to add ""[N/M]"" (for 1 <= N <= M) to; the title of each patch in the series, so it is clear that there is an order; and what that order is. Developers should participate in code reviews as both reviewers and; authors. If someone is kind enough to review your code, you should return the; favor for someone else. Note that anyone is welcome to review and give feedback; on a patch, but approval of patches should be consistent with the policy above.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeReview.rst:11773,patch,patch,11773,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeReview.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeReview.rst,7,['patch'],"['patch', 'patches']"

Raw profiles may be dependent on the specific compiler; revision used to generate them. It's inadvisable to store raw profiles for; long periods of time. * Tools must retain **backwards** compatibility with indexed profile formats.; These formats are not forwards-compatible: i.e, a tool which uses format; version X will not be able to understand format version (X+k). * Tools must also retain **backwards** compatibility with the format of the; coverage mappings emitted into instrumented binaries. These formats are not; forwards-compatible. * The JSON coverage export format has a (major, minor, patch) version triple.; Only a major version increment indicates a backwards-incompatible change. A; minor version increment is for added functionality, and patch version; increments are for bugfixes. Impact of llvm optimizations on coverage reports; ================================================. llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no; impact on coverage report quality. This is due to the fact that the mapping; from source regions to profile counters is immutable, and is generated before; the llvm optimizer kicks in. The optimizer can't prove that profile counter; instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the; program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade; during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables.

RooFit's [`BatchMode`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8) has been around; [since ROOT 6.20](https://root.cern/doc/v620/release-notes.html#fast-function-evaluation-and-vectorisation).; It was further [improved in ROOT 6.24](https://root.cern/doc/v624/release-notes.html#massive-speed-up-of-roofits-batchmode-on-cpus-with-vector-extensions) to use vector extensions of modern CPUs without recompiling ROOT, introducing the new `RooBatchCompute` library as a backend that is compiled multiple times for different instruction sets.; With this release, `RooBatchCompute` is also compiled with the Nvidia CUDA compiler to support the computation on GPUs if supported by the RooFit object.; You can use the CUDA mode by passing `""cuda""` to the `BatchMode()` command argument:; ```C++; model.fitTo(data); // not using the batch mode; model.fitTo(data, RooFit::BatchMode(true)); // using the BatchMode on CPU (RooFit::BatchMode(""cpu"") is equivalent); model.fitTo(data, RooFit::BatchMode(""cuda"")); // using the new CUDA backend; ```.

Various new pythonizations are introduced to streamline your RooFit code in Python. For a complete list of all pythonized classes and functions, please see the [RooFit pythonizations page in the reference guide](https://root.cern/doc/v626/group__RoofitPythonizations.html).; All RooFit Python tutorials have been updated to profit from all available pythonizations. Some notable highlights are listed in the following. #### Keyword argument pythonizations. All functions that take RooFit command arguments as parameters now accept equivalent Python keyword arguments, for example simplifying calls to [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooAbsPdf.html#a5f79f16f4a26a19c9e66fb5c080f59c5) such as:; ```Python; model.fitTo(data, ROOT.RooFit.Range(""left,right""), ROOT.RooFit.Save()); ```; which becomes:; ```Python; model.fitTo(data, Range=""left,right"", Save=True); ```. #### String to enum pythonizations. Many functions that take an enum as a parameter now accept also a string with the enum label. Take for example this expression:; ```Python; data.plotOn(frame, ROOT.RooFit.DataError(ROOT.RooAbsData.SumW2); ```; Combining the enum pythonization with the keyword argument pythonization explained before, this becomes:; ```Python; data.plotOn(frame, DataError=""SumW2""); ```.

Deployability,"ow, how does the interpreter know this? Remember, when you build a; class that you want to use in the ROOT environment, you use `rootcling`; that builds the so-called stub functions and the dictionary. These; functions and the dictionary contain the knowledge of the used classes.; To do this, `rootcling` parses all the header files. ROOT has defined; some special syntax to inform Cling of certain things, this is done in; the comments so that the code still compiles with a C++ compiler. For example, you have a class with a `Draw()` method, which will display; itself. You would like a context menu to appear when on clicks on the; image of an object of this class. The recipe is the following:. - The class has to contain the `ClassDef/ClassImp` macros. - For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a; comment after the declaration containing `*MENU*` or `*TOGGLE*`; depending on the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods; (setters). The `*TOGGLE*` comment is used to toggle a `boolean` data; field. In that case, it is safe to call the data field `fMyBool`; where `MyBool` is the name of the setter `SetMyBool`. Replace; `MyBool` with your own `boolean` variable. - You can specify arguments and the data members in which to store the; arguments. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; class MyClass : public TObject {; private:; int fV1; // first variable; double fV2; // second variable; public:; int GetV1() {return fV1;}; double GetV2() {return fV2;}; void SetV1(int x1) { fV1 = x1;} // *MENU*; void SetV2(double d2) { fV2 = d2;} // *MENU*; void SetBoth(int x1, double d2) {fV1 = x1; fV2 = d2;}. ClassDef (MyClass,1); }; ```. To specify arguments:. ``` {.cpp}; void SetXXX(Int_t x1, Float_t y2); //*MENU* *ARGS={x1=>fV1}; ```. This statement is in the comment field, after the \*MENU\*. If there is; more than one argument, these arguments are separated by commas, where; fX1 and fY2 are data fields in the same class. ``` {.cpp}; void SetXXX(Int_t x1, Float_t y2); //*MENU*",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:7571,toggle,toggle,7571,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['toggle'],['toggle']

Deployability,"owing process:. * It is a general goal to support LLVM and GCC versions from the last 3 years; at a minimum. This time-based guideline is not strict: we may support much; older compilers, or decide to support fewer versions. * An RFC is sent to the `LLVM Discourse forums`_. - Detail upsides of the version increase (e.g. which newer C++ language or; library features LLVM should use; avoid miscompiles in particular compiler; versions, etc).; - Detail downsides on important platforms (e.g. Ubuntu LTS status). * Once the RFC reaches consensus, update the CMake toolchain version checks as; well as the :doc:`getting started<GettingStarted>` guide. This provides a; softer transition path for developers compiling LLVM, because the; error can be turned into a warning using a CMake flag. This is an important; step: LLVM still doesn't have code which requires the new toolchains, but it; soon will. If you compile LLVM but don't read the forums, we should; tell you!. * Ensure that at least one LLVM release has had this soft-error. Not all; developers compile LLVM top-of-tree. These release-bound developers should; also be told about upcoming changes. * Turn the soft-error into a hard-error after said LLVM release has branched. * Update the :doc:`coding standards<CodingStandards>` to allow the new; features we've explicitly approved in the RFC. * Start using the new features in LLVM's codebase.

It is possible for a hardware shader to need access to more *user data; entries* than there are slots available in user data registers for one; or more hardware shader stages. In that case, the PAL runtime expects; the necessary *user data entries* to be spilled to GPU memory and use; one user data register to point to the spilled user data memory. The; value of the *user data entry* must then represent the location where; a shader expects to read the low 32-bits of the table's GPU virtual; address.

Deployability,"patching are needed. Because the; intrinsics have experimental status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed. The stack map functionality described in this document is separate; from the functionality described in; :ref:`stack-map`. `GCFunctionMetadata` provides the location of; pointers into a collected heap captured by the `GCRoot` intrinsic,; which can also be considered a ""stack map"". Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack map. The stack maps described here could potentially provide; richer information to a garbage collecting runtime, but that usage; will not be discussed in this document. Intrinsics; ==========. The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:3123,patch,patchpoint,3123,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['patch'],['patchpoint']

In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2. Since Apache version 2.4 FastCGI is directly supported - there is no need to compile and install external modules any more.; One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```; ProxyPass ""/root.app/"" ""fcgi://localhost:9000/"" enablereuse=on; ```. More information can be found in [FastCGI proxy docu](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html).; After restarting apache server one should be able to open address: `http://apache_host_name/root.app/`.; There are many ways to configure user authentication in Apache. Example of digest auth for FastCGI server:. ```; <Location ""/root.app/"">; AuthType Digest; AuthName ""root""; AuthDigestDomain ""/root.app/"" ""root""; AuthDigestProvider file; AuthUserFile ""/srv/auth/auth.txt""; Require valid-user; </Location>; ```. ### Configure fastcgi with lighttpd. An example of configuration file for **lighttpd** server is:. ```; server.modules += ( ""mod_fastcgi"" ); fastcgi.server = (; ""/root.app"" =>; (( ""host"" => ""192.168.1.11"",; ""port"" => 9000,",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md:11154,install,install,11154,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,1,['install'],['install']

In an extension to the technique discussed in Feldman and Cousins paper,; the FeldmanCousins class also performs a ""profile construction"" if their are nuisance parameters.; In this case, the parameters of interest are scanned in a regular grid. For each point in the grid; the calculator finds the best fit value of the nuisance parameters (given the data). The construction; is then only performed in this subspace of the parameters. As a result, the number of points in the; construction only scales in the number of parameters of interest, not in the number of nuisance parameters.

Deployability,"pings; ========. To be translated to or from a YAML mapping for your type T you must specialize; llvm::yaml::MappingTraits on T and implement the ""void mapping(IO &io, T&)""; method. If your native data structures use pointers to a class everywhere,; you can specialize on the class pointer. Examples:. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. // Example of struct Foo which is used by value; template <>; struct MappingTraits<Foo> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Foo &foo) {; io.mapOptional(""size"", foo.size);; ...; }; };. // Example of struct Bar which is natively always a pointer; template <>; struct MappingTraits<Bar*> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Bar *&bar) {; io.mapOptional(""size"", bar->size);; ...; }; };. There are circumstances where we want to allow the entire mapping to be; read as an enumeration. For example, say some configuration option; started as an enumeration. Then it got more complex so it is now a; mapping. But it is necessary to support the old configuration files.; In that case, add a function ``enumInput`` like for; ``ScalarEnumerationTraits::enumeration``. Examples:. .. code-block:: c++. struct FooBarEnum {; int Foo;; int Bar;; bool operator==(const FooBarEnum &R) const {; return Foo == R.Foo && Bar == R.Bar;; }; };. template <> struct MappingTraits<FooBarEnum> {; static void enumInput(IO &io, FooBarEnum &Val) {; io.enumCase(Val, ""OnlyFoo"", FooBarEnum({1, 0}));; io.enumCase(Val, ""OnlyBar"", FooBarEnum({0, 1}));; }; static void mapping(IO &io, FooBarEnum &Val) {; io.mapOptional(""Foo"", Val.Foo);; io.mapOptional(""Bar"", Val.Bar);; }; };. No Normalization; ----------------. The ``mapping()`` method is responsible, if needed, for normalizing and; denormalizing. In a simple case where the native data structure requires no; normalization, the mapping method just uses mapOptional() or mapRequired() to; bind the struct's fields to YAML key names. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llv",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst:15901,configurat,configuration,15901,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

For ""non-SPMD"" targets which cannot spawn multiple; work-items on the fly using hardware, which covers practically all non-GPU; devices such as CPUs and DSPs, additional processing is needed for the kernels; to support multiple work-item execution. For this, a 3rd party toolchain,; such as for example `POCL <http://portablecl.org/>`_, can be used. This target does not support multiple memory segments and, therefore, the fake; address space map can be added using the :ref:`-ffake-address-space-map; <opencl_fake_address_space_map>` flag.

Tab completion, output and graphics inlining have been added. These functionalities are automatically available upon import of the ROOT module in a Notebook or at startup of a ROOT prompt kernel.; We made it easier to use ROOT notebooks locally, by providing a 'root --notebook' command option to start a local notebook server customised with all the ROOT features.

The algorithm is controlled by the given absolute and relative tolerance. The iterations are continued until the following condition is satisfied; $$; absErr <= max ( epsAbs, epsRel * Integral); $$; Where *absErr* is an estimate of the absolute error (it can be retrieved with `GSLIntegrator::Error()`) and *Integral* is the estimate of the function integral; (it can be obtained with `GSLIntegrator::Result()`). The possible integration algorithm types to use with the GSLIntegrator are the following. More information is provided in the `GSL` users documentation.; * `ROOT::Math::Integration::kNONADAPTIVE` : based on `gsl_integration_qng`.

You may have noticed that ``%simplified`` is narrower than ``%c``: this is not; a problem, because ``llvm::replaceAllDbgUsesWith`` takes care of inserting the; necessary conversion operations into the DIExpressions of updated debug uses.

For example, the following; two statements create and fill a histogram 10 000 times with a default; Gaussian distribution of `mean` `0` and `sigma` `1` :. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1F h1(""h1"",""Histo from a Gaussian"",100,-3,3);; root[] h1.FillRandom(""gaus"",10000);; ```. **`TH1`**`::GetRandom()` can be used to get a random number; distributed according the contents of a histogram. To fill a histogram; following the distribution in an existing histogram you can use the; second signature of **`TH1`**`::FillRandom()`. Next code snipped; assumes that `h` is an existing histogram (**`TH1`** ). ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1F h2(""h2"",""Histo from existing histo"",100,-3,3);; root[] h2.FillRandom(&h1, 1000);; ```. The distribution contained in the histogram `h1` ( **`TH1`** ) is; integrated over the channel contents. It is normalized to one. The; second parameter (1000) indicates how many random numbers are; generated. Getting 1 random number implies:. - Generating a random number between 0 and 1 (say `r1` ). - Find the bin in the normalized integral for `r1`. - Fill histogram channel.

Deployability,"pp. Note that this example assumes the presence of a suitably annotated; :ref:`mutexheader` that declares which methods perform locking,; unlocking, and so on. Basic Concepts: Capabilities; ============================. Thread safety analysis provides a way of protecting *resources* with; *capabilities*. A resource is either a data member, or a function/method; that provides access to some underlying resource. The analysis ensures that; the calling thread cannot access the *resource* (i.e. call the function, or; read/write the data) unless it has the *capability* to do so. Capabilities are associated with named C++ objects which declare specific; methods to acquire and release the capability. The name of the object serves; to identify the capability. The most common example is a mutex. For example,; if ``mu`` is a mutex, then calling ``mu.Lock()`` causes the calling thread; to acquire the capability to access data that is protected by ``mu``. Similarly,; calling ``mu.Unlock()`` releases that capability. A thread may hold a capability either *exclusively* or *shared*. An exclusive; capability can be held by only one thread at a time, while a shared capability; can be held by many threads at the same time. This mechanism enforces a; multiple-reader, single-writer pattern. Write operations to protected data; require exclusive access, while read operations require only shared access. At any given moment during program execution, a thread holds a specific set of; capabilities (e.g. the set of mutexes that it has locked.) These act like keys; or tokens that allow the thread to access a given resource. Just like physical; security keys, a thread cannot make copy of a capability, nor can it destroy; one. A thread can only release a capability to another thread, or acquire one; from another thread. The annotations are deliberately agnostic about the; exact mechanism used to acquire and release capabilities; it assumes that the; underlying implementation (e.g. the Mutex imple",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:4284,release,releases,4284,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['release'],['releases']

For Windows developers, the Visual Studio project generators in CMake do; not support `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html>`_.; However, the Ninja generator does support this variable and can be used; on Windows to generate a suitable ``compile_commands.json`` that invokes; the MSVC compiler. First, you will need to install `Ninja`_. Once installed, the Ninja; executable will need to be in your search path for CMake to locate it. Next, assuming you already have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you; need to have the appropriate environment variables configured so that CMake; will locate the MSVC compiler for the Ninja generator. The `documentation; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#path_and_environment>`_; describes the necessary environment variable settings, but the simplest thing; is to use a `developer command-prompt window; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts>`_; or call a `developer command file; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_file_locations>`_; to set the environment variables appropriately.

Instead of having only the RModel class to store model information, now SOFIE has RModel, RModel_GNN and RModel_GraphIndependent classes which are inherited from RModel_Base.; 2. **RModel_GNN** is used to store a GNN model having nodes, edges, and globals with functions for their update and aggregate(for inter-relationships).; 3. **RModel_GraphIndependent** is used to store an independent Graph model with nodes, edges and globals with their individual update functions.; 4. **RFunctions** are used to declare update/aggregate operations over graph components. Currently supported RFunctions include:; - **Update Functions**; - RFunction_MLP; - **Aggregate Functions**; - RFunction_Mean; - RFunction_Sum; 5. Pythonized functions for parsing a Graphnets' model can be used to generate inference code; ```; import graph_nets as gn; from graph_nets import utils_tf.

Deployability,"presents a C++ scope; specifier, such as ""``A::B::``"". This corresponds to the grammar; productions ""*::*"" and ""*:: [opt] nested-name-specifier*"". The; ``AnnotationValue`` pointer is a ``NestedNameSpecifier *`` returned by the; ``Sema::ActOnCXXGlobalScopeSpecifier`` and; ``Sema::ActOnCXXNestedNameSpecifier`` callbacks.; #. **tok::annot_template_id**: This annotation token represents a C++; template-id such as ""``foo<int, 4>``"", where ""``foo``"" is the name of a; template. The ``AnnotationValue`` pointer is a pointer to a ``malloc``'d; ``TemplateIdAnnotation`` object. Depending on the context, a parsed; template-id that names a type might become a typename annotation token (if; all we care about is the named type, e.g., because it occurs in a type; specifier) or might remain a template-id token (if we want to retain more; source location information or produce a new type, e.g., in a declaration of; a class template specialization). template-id annotation tokens that refer; to a type can be ""upgraded"" to typename annotation tokens by the parser. As mentioned above, annotation tokens are not returned by the preprocessor,; they are formed on demand by the parser. This means that the parser has to be; aware of cases where an annotation could occur and form it where appropriate.; This is somewhat similar to how the parser handles Translation Phase 6 of C99:; String Concatenation (see C99 5.1.1.2). In the case of string concatenation,; the preprocessor just returns distinct ``tok::string_literal`` and; ``tok::wide_string_literal`` tokens and the parser eats a sequence of them; wherever the grammar indicates that a string literal can occur. In order to do this, whenever the parser expects a ``tok::identifier`` or; ``tok::coloncolon``, it should call the ``TryAnnotateTypeOrScopeToken`` or; ``TryAnnotateCXXScopeToken`` methods to form the annotation token. These; methods will maximally form the specified annotation tokens and replace the; current token with them, if applicable.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:52215,upgrade,upgraded,52215,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['upgrade'],['upgraded']

HOW LLVM-MCA WORKS; ------------------. :program:`llvm-mca` takes assembly code as input. The assembly code is parsed; into a sequence of MCInst with the help of the existing LLVM target assembly; parsers. The parsed sequence of MCInst is then analyzed by a ``Pipeline`` module; to generate a performance report. The Pipeline module simulates the execution of the machine code sequence in a; loop of iterations (default is 100). During this process, the pipeline collects; a number of execution related statistics. At the end of this process, the; pipeline generates and prints a report from the collected statistics. Here is an example of a performance report generated by the tool for a; dot-product of two packed float vectors of four elements. The analysis is; conducted for target x86, cpu btver2. The following result can be produced via; the following command using the example located at; ``test/tools/llvm-mca/X86/BtVer2/dot-product.s``:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-mca -mtriple=x86_64-unknown-unknown -mcpu=btver2 -iterations=300 dot-product.s. .. code-block:: none.

However,; there have been issues with this bridge working correctly in the past,; so it's not clear if this is something that will be supported going forward. Monorepo Drawbacks; ------------------. * Using the monolithic repository may add overhead for those contributing to a; standalone sub-project, particularly on runtimes like libcxx and compiler-rt; that don't rely on LLVM; currently, a fresh clone of libcxx is only 15MB (vs.; 1GB for the monorepo), and the commit rate of LLVM may cause more frequent; `git push` collisions when upstreaming. Affected contributors may be able to; use the SVN bridge or the single-subproject Git mirrors. However, it's; undecided if these projects will continue to be maintained.; * Using the monolithic repository may add overhead for those *integrating* a; standalone sub-project, even if they aren't contributing to it, due to the; same disk space concern as the point above.

The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker. When; contributing a patch specifically for reformatting Python files, use black,; which currently only supports formatting entire files. Here are some quick examples, but see the black and darker documentation for; details:. .. code-block:: bash. $ pip install black=='23.*' darker # install black 23.x and darker; $ darker test.py # format uncommitted changes; $ darker -r HEAD^ test.py # also format changes from last commit; $ black test.py # format entire file. Instead of individual file names, you can specify directories to; darker, and it will find the changed files. However, if a directory is; large, like a clone of the LLVM repository, darker can be painfully; slow.

The basic function of the 1-dimensional peak searching is described in; details in [4], [5].

Deployability,"quality more aggressively than the default behavior,; especially in cross-DSO mode which normally preserves function address; equality entirely. Furthermore, it is occasionally necessary for code not compiled with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall`` to take a function address that is valid; for CFI. For example, this is necessary when a function's address; is taken by assembly code and then called by CFI-checking C code. The; ``__attribute__((cfi_canonical_jump_table))`` attribute may be used to make; the jump table entry of a specific function canonical so that the external; code will end up taking an address for the function that will pass CFI checks. ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall`` and ``-fsanitize=function``; ----------------------------------------------------. This tool is similar to ``-fsanitize=function`` in that both tools check; the types of function calls. However, the two tools occupy different points; on the design space; ``-fsanitize=function`` is a developer tool designed; to find bugs in local development builds, whereas ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall``; is a security hardening mechanism designed to be deployed in release builds. ``-fsanitize=function`` has a higher space and time overhead due to a more; complex type check at indirect call sites, which may make it unsuitable for; deployment. On the other hand, ``-fsanitize=function`` conforms more closely with the C++; standard and user expectations around interaction with shared libraries;; the identity of function pointers is maintained, and calls across shared; library boundaries are no different from calls within a single program or; shared library. .. _kcfi:. ``-fsanitize=kcfi``; -------------------. This is an alternative indirect call control-flow integrity scheme designed; for low-level system software, such as operating system kernels.

Deployability,"queue is either caused by data dependency chains or by a; sub-optimal usage of hardware resources. Sometimes, resource pressure can be; mitigated by rewriting the kernel using different instructions that consume; different scheduler resources. Schedulers with a small queue are less resilient; to bottlenecks caused by the presence of long data dependencies. The scheduler; statistics are displayed by using the command option ``-all-stats`` or; ``-scheduler-stats``. The next table, *Retire Control Unit*, presents a histogram displaying a count,; representing the number of instructions retired on some number of cycles. In; this case, of the 610 simulated cycles, two instructions were retired during the; same cycle 399 times (65.4%) and there were 109 cycles where no instructions; were retired. The retire statistics are displayed by using the command option; ``-all-stats`` or ``-retire-stats``. The last table presented is *Register File statistics*. Each physical register; file (PRF) used by the pipeline is presented in this table. In the case of AMD; Jaguar, there are two register files, one for floating-point registers (JFpuPRF); and one for integer registers (JIntegerPRF). The table shows that of the 900; instructions processed, there were 900 mappings created. Since this dot-product; example utilized only floating point registers, the JFPuPRF was responsible for; creating the 900 mappings. However, we see that the pipeline only used a; maximum of 35 of 72 available register slots at any given time. We can conclude; that the floating point PRF was the only register file used for the example, and; that it was never resource constrained. The register file statistics are; displayed by using the command option ``-all-stats`` or; ``-register-file-stats``.

This code, from ``llvm/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Layer.cpp``, adds a; ThreadSafeModule to a given JITDylib by wrapping it up in a; ``MaterializationUnit`` (in this case a ``BasicIRLayerMaterializationUnit``).; Most layers that derived from IRLayer can rely on this default implementation; of the ``add`` method. These two operations, ``add`` and ``emit``, together constitute the layer; concept: A layer is a way to wrap a part of a compiler pipeline (in this case; the ""opt"" phase of an LLVM compiler) whose API is opaque to ORC with an; interface that ORC can call as needed. The add method takes an; module in some input program representation (in this case an LLVM IR module); and stores it in the target ``JITDylib``, arranging for it to be passed back; to the layer's emit method when any symbol defined by that module is requested.; Each layer can complete its own work by calling the ``emit`` method of its base; layer. For example, in this tutorial our IRTransformLayer calls through to; our IRCompileLayer to compile the transformed IR, and our IRCompileLayer in; turn calls our ObjectLayer to link the object file produced by our compiler.

These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions. It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped. It may not throw an; exception. When the semantics call for performing one of these operations on a retainable; object pointer, if that pointer is ``null`` then the effect is a no-op. All of the semantics described in this document are subject to additional; :ref:`optimization rules <arc.optimization>` which permit the removal or; optimization of operations based on local knowledge of data flow.

If the former, clone the repository, check out a specific tagged release as; needed, then run the following steps to add Cling and build a wheel.; Once built, install the wheel as appropriate::. $ git clone https://github.com/wlav/cppyy-backend.git; $ cd cppyy-backend/cling; $ python setup.py egg_info; $ python create_src_directory.py; $ python setup.py bdist_wheel; $ python -m pip install dist/cppyy_cling-* --upgrade. .. note::; ``cppyy-cling`` wheels do not depend on the Python interpreter and can; thus be re-used for any version of Python or PyPy.

These pass pipelines make a; good starting point for an optimizing compiler for any language, but they have; been carefully tuned for C and C++, not your target language. You will almost; certainly need to use a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order.

Note that LLVM is free to duplicate code containing; statepoint calls, and this may transform IR that had a unique 'id' per; lexical call to statepoint to IR that does not. If 'num patch bytes' is non-zero then the call instruction; corresponding to the statepoint is not emitted and LLVM emits 'num; patch bytes' bytes of nops in its place. LLVM will emit code to; prepare the function arguments and retrieve the function return value; in accordance to the calling convention; the former before the nop; sequence and the latter after the nop sequence. It is expected that; the user will patch over the 'num patch bytes' bytes of nops with a; calling sequence specific to their runtime before executing the; generated machine code. There are no guarantees with respect to the; alignment of the nop sequence. Unlike :doc:`StackMaps` statepoints do; not have a concept of shadow bytes. Note that semantically the; statepoint still represents a call or invoke to 'target', and the nop; sequence after patching is expected to represent an operation; equivalent to a call or invoke to 'target'. The 'target' operand is the function actually being called. The operand; must have an :ref:`elementtype <attr_elementtype>` attribute specifying; the function type of the target. The target can be specified as either; a symbolic LLVM function, or as an arbitrary Value of pointer type. Note; that the function type must match the signature of the callee and the; types of the 'call parameters' arguments. The '#call args' operand is the number of arguments to the actual; call. It must exactly match the number of arguments passed in the; 'call parameters' variable length section. The 'flags' operand is used to specify extra information about the; statepoint. This is currently only used to mark certain statepoints; as GC transitions.

The `PassManager <https://llvm.org/doxygen/PassManager_8h_source.html>`_ `class; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PassManager.html>`_ takes a list of; passes, ensures their :ref:`prerequisites <writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction>`; are set up correctly, and then schedules passes to run efficiently. All of the; LLVM tools that run passes use the PassManager for execution of these passes. The PassManager does two main things to try to reduce the execution time of a; series of passes:. #. **Share analysis results.** The ``PassManager`` attempts to avoid; recomputing analysis results as much as possible. This means keeping track; of which analyses are available already, which analyses get invalidated, and; which analyses are needed to be run for a pass. An important part of work; is that the ``PassManager`` tracks the exact lifetime of all analysis; results, allowing it to :ref:`free memory; <writing-an-llvm-pass-releaseMemory>` allocated to holding analysis results; as soon as they are no longer needed. #. **Pipeline the execution of passes on the program.** The ``PassManager``; attempts to get better cache and memory usage behavior out of a series of; passes by pipelining the passes together. This means that, given a series; of consecutive :ref:`FunctionPass <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>`, it; will execute all of the :ref:`FunctionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the first function, then all of the; :ref:`FunctionPasses <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the second; function, etc... until the entire program has been run through the passes. This improves the cache behavior of the compiler, because it is only; touching the LLVM program representation for a single function at a time,; instead of traversing the entire program.

Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them. This prevents ``buf`` and; ``count`` from temporarily falling out of sync due to updates happening at a; distance. The example below shows a function ``alloc_buf`` that initializes a struct that; members that use the ``__counted_by`` annotation.

Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code.

The 'id' operand is a constant integer that is reported as the ID; field in the generated stackmap. LLVM does not interpret this; parameter in any way and its meaning is up to the statepoint user to; decide. Note that LLVM is free to duplicate code containing; statepoint calls, and this may transform IR that had a unique 'id' per; lexical call to statepoint to IR that does not. If 'num patch bytes' is non-zero then the call instruction; corresponding to the statepoint is not emitted and LLVM emits 'num; patch bytes' bytes of nops in its place. LLVM will emit code to; prepare the function arguments and retrieve the function return value; in accordance to the calling convention; the former before the nop; sequence and the latter after the nop sequence. It is expected that; the user will patch over the 'num patch bytes' bytes of nops with a; calling sequence specific to their runtime before executing the; generated machine code. There are no guarantees with respect to the; alignment of the nop sequence. Unlike :doc:`StackMaps` statepoints do; not have a concept of shadow bytes. Note that semantically the; statepoint still represents a call or invoke to 'target', and the nop; sequence after patching is expected to represent an operation; equivalent to a call or invoke to 'target'. The 'target' operand is the function actually being called. The operand; must have an :ref:`elementtype <attr_elementtype>` attribute specifying; the function type of the target. The target can be specified as either; a symbolic LLVM function, or as an arbitrary Value of pointer type.

This tool was inspired by the work of Glen Cowan together with Stephan; Horner, Sascha Caron,�; Eilam Gross, and others. �; The initial implementation is independent work. �The major step forward; in the approach was�; to provide a well defined algorithm that specifies the order of; polynomial to be included�; in the correction. �This is an empirical algorithm, so in addition to the; nominal model it�; needs either a real data set or a simulated one. �In the early work, the; nominal model was taken; to be a histogram from Monte Carlo simulations, but in this; implementation it is generalized to an; arbitrary PDF (which includes a RooHistPdf). �The algorithm basically; consists of a�; hypothesis test of an nth-order correction (null) against a n+1-th order; correction (alternate).�; The quantity q = -2 log LR is used to determine whether the n+1-th order; correction is a major�; improvement to the n-th order correction. �The distribution of q is; expected to be roughly�; \chi^2 with one degree of freedom if the n-th order correction is a good; model for the data.�; �Thus, one only moves to the n+1-th order correction of q is relatively; large. �The chance that�; one moves from the n-th to the n+1-th order correction when the n-th; order correction�; (eg. a type 1 error) is sufficient is given by the Prob(\chi^2_1 >; threshold). �The constructor�; of this class allows you to directly set this tolerance (in terms of; probability that the n+1-th; �term is added unnecessarily).

The most; significant difference is in reading a file without compression. The file size with compression, write times with and without compression; and the read times with and without compression all favor the; **`TClonesArray`**. ## Impact of Compression on I/O. This benchmark illustrates the pros and cons of the compression option.; We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small; compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O; operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage; of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk; space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression; may slow down the program's performance.

Docker basics; -------------; If you've never heard about Docker before, you might find this section helpful; to get a very basic explanation of it.; `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ is a popular solution for running programs in; an isolated and reproducible environment, especially to maintain releases for; software deployed to large distributed fleets.; It uses linux kernel namespaces and cgroups to provide a lightweight isolation; inside currently running linux kernel.; A single active instance of dockerized environment is called a *docker; container*.; A snapshot of a docker container filesystem is called a *docker image*.; One can start a container from a prebuilt docker image. Docker images are built from a so-called *Dockerfile*, a source file written in; a specialized language that defines instructions to be used when build; the docker image (see `official; documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/>`_ for more; details). A minimal Dockerfile typically contains a base image and a number; of RUN commands that have to be executed to build the image.

While this document may provide guidance for some mechanical formatting issues,; whitespace, or other ""microscopic details"", these are not fixed standards.; Always follow the golden rule:. .. _Golden Rule:. **If you are extending, enhancing, or bug fixing already implemented code,; use the style that is already being used so that the source is uniform and; easy to follow.**. Note that some code bases (e.g. ``libc++``) have special reasons to deviate; from the coding standards. For example, in the case of ``libc++``, this is; because the naming and other conventions are dictated by the C++ standard. There are some conventions that are not uniformly followed in the code base; (e.g. the naming convention). This is because they are relatively new, and a; lot of code was written before they were put in place. Our long term goal is; for the entire codebase to follow the convention, but we explicitly *do not*; want patches that do large-scale reformatting of existing code. On the other; hand, it is reasonable to rename the methods of a class if you're about to; change it in some other way. Please commit such changes separately to; make code review easier. The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to increase the readability and; maintainability of our common source base. Languages, Libraries, and Standards; ===================================. Most source code in LLVM and other LLVM projects using these coding standards; is C++ code.

Status of the New and Legacy Pass Managers; ==========================================. LLVM currently contains two pass managers, the legacy PM and the new PM. The; optimization pipeline (aka the middle-end) uses the new PM, whereas the backend; target-dependent code generation uses the legacy PM. The legacy PM somewhat works with the optimization pipeline, but this is; deprecated and there are ongoing efforts to remove its usage. Some IR passes are considered part of the backend codegen pipeline even if; they are LLVM IR passes (whereas all MIR passes are codegen passes). This; includes anything added via ``TargetPassConfig`` hooks, e.g.; ``TargetPassConfig::addCodeGenPrepare()``. The ``TargetMachine::adjustPassManager()`` function that was used to extend a; legacy PM with passes on a per target basis has been removed. It was mainly; used from opt, but since support for using the default pipelines has been; removed in opt the function isn't needed any longer. In the new PM such; adjustments are done by using ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()``. Currently there are efforts to make the codegen pipeline work with the new; PM.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:20762,pipeline,pipeline,20762,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,5,['pipeline'],"['pipeline', 'pipelines']"
Deployability,"red a ""stack map"". Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack map. The stack maps described here could potentially provide; richer information to a garbage collecting runtime, but that usage; will not be discussed in this document. Intrinsics; ==========. The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling. Each instance of one of these intrinsics generates a stack map record; in the :ref:`stackmap-section`. The record includes an ID, allowing; the runtime to uniquely identify the stack map, and the offset within; the code from the beginning of the enclosing function.

With ``--update-tags`` the tool will migrate annotated tags pointing; to submodule commits that were inlined into the zipped history. If; the umbrella pulled in an upstream commit that happened to have a tag; pointing to it, that tag will be migrated, which is almost certainly; not what is wanted. The tag can always be moved back to its original; commit after rewriting, or the ``--update-tags`` option may be; discarded and any local tags would then be migrated manually. **Example 2: Nested sources layout**.

A *config-macros-declaration* shall only be present on a top-level module, i.e., a module that is not nested within an enclosing module. The ``exhaustive`` attribute specifies that the list of macros in the *config-macros-declaration* is exhaustive, meaning that no other macro definition is intended to have an effect on the API of that module. .. note::. The ``exhaustive`` attribute implies that any macro definitions; for macros not listed as configuration macros should be ignored; completely when building the module.

If your project deliberately uses unlocalized user-facing strings (for example, in a debugging UI that is never shown to users), you can suppress the analyzer warnings (and document your intent) with a function that just returns its input but is annotated to return a localized string:. __attribute__((annotate(""returns_localized_nsstring""))); static inline NSString *LocalizationNotNeeded(NSString *s) {; return s;; }. You can then call this function when creating your debugging UI:. [field setStringValue:LocalizationNotNeeded(@""Debug"")];. Some projects may also find it useful to use NSLocalizedString but add ""DNL"" or ""Do Not Localize"" to the string contents as a convention:. UILabel *testLabel = [[UILabel alloc] init];; NSString *s = NSLocalizedString(@""Hello <Do Not Localize>"", @""For debug purposes"");; [testLabel setText:s];.

Deployability,"ring the implementation. Implementation guidelines; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This section explains how to extend clang with the new functionality. **Parsing functionality**. If an extension modifies the standard parsing it needs to be added to; the clang frontend source code. This also means that the associated macro; indicating the presence of the extension should be added to clang. The default flow for adding a new extension into the frontend is to; modify `OpenCLExtensions.def; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/include/clang/Basic/OpenCLExtensions.def>`__,; containing the list of all extensions and optional features supported by; the frontend. This will add the macro automatically and also add a field in the target; options ``clang::TargetOptions::OpenCLFeaturesMap`` to control the exposure; of the new extension during the compilation. Note that by default targets like `SPIR-V`, `SPIR` or `X86` expose all the OpenCL; extensions. For all other targets the configuration has to be made explicitly. Note that the target extension support performed by clang can be overridden; with :option:`-cl-ext` command-line flags. .. _opencl_ext_libs:. **Library functionality**. If an extension adds functionality that does not modify standard language; parsing it should not require modifying anything other than header files and; ``OpenCLBuiltins.td`` detailed in :ref:`OpenCL builtins <opencl_builtins>`.; Most commonly such extensions add functionality via libraries (by adding; non-native types or functions) parsed regularly. Similar to other languages this; is the most common way to add new functionality. Clang has standard headers where new types and functions are being added,; for more details refer to; :ref:`the section on the OpenCL Header <opencl_header>`. The macros indicating; the presence of such extensions can be added in the standard header files; conditioned on target specific predefined macros or/and language version; predefined macros (see `feature",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst:9187,configurat,configuration,9187,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/OpenCLSupport.rst,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test.

As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking. Modern x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address. As a consequence, we need a way to check loads that; occur after a misspeculated predicate but where the load and the misspeculated; predicate are in different functions. In essence, we need some interprocedural; generalization of the predicate state tracking. A primary challenge to passing; the predicate state between functions is that we would like to not require a; change to the ABI or calling convention in order to make this mitigation more; deployable, and further would like code mitigated in this way to be easily; mixed with code not mitigated in this way and without completely losing the; value of the mitigation. ##### Embed the predicate state into the high bit(s) of the stack pointer. We can use the same technique that allows hardening pointers to pass the; predicate state into and out of functions. The stack pointer is trivially; passed between functions and we can test for it having the high bits set to; detect when it has been marked due to misspeculation.

This improves run-time performance by allowing a dramatic reduction in function calls and code; branches at the expense of some code duplication. There are 3 versions of this loop implemented in TBufferFile and overloaded in TBufferXML and TBufferSQL:. virtual Int_t ReadSequence(const TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence &sequence, void *object);; virtual Int_t ReadSequenc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/v528/index.html:2549,patch,patches,2549,io/doc/v528/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/io/doc/v528/index.html,2,['patch'],['patches']

In previous versions, it could sometime return `kEntryNotFound` even for well-behaved event loops.; - Add `TEntryList::AddSubList` to specifically add a sub-list to the main list of entries. Consequently, add also a new option `""sync""` in `TChain::SetEntryList` to connect the sub-trees of the chain to the sub-lists of the entry list in lockstep (PR [#8660](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8660)).; - Add `TEntryList::EnterRange` to add all entries in a certain range `[start, end)` to the entry list (PR [#8740](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8740)). ## RNTuple. ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has been upgraded to the version 1 of the binary format specification. Compared to the v0 format, the header is ~40% smaller and the footer ~100% smaller (after zstd compression). More details in PR [#8897](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8897).; RNTuple is still experimental and is scheduled to become production grade in 2024.

Deployability,"rovides a straightforward; way to find instructions covered by a scope. Object lifetime in optimized code; =================================. In the example above, every variable assignment uniquely corresponds to a; memory store to the variable's position on the stack. However in heavily; optimized code LLVM promotes most variables into SSA values, which can; eventually be placed in physical registers or memory locations. To track SSA; values through compilation, when objects are promoted to SSA values an; ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic is created for each assignment, recording the; variable's new location. Compared with the ``llvm.dbg.declare`` intrinsic:. * A dbg.value terminates the effect of any preceding dbg.values for (any; overlapping fragments of) the specified variable.; * The dbg.value's position in the IR defines where in the instruction stream; the variable's value changes.; * Operands can be constants, indicating the variable is assigned a; constant value. Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer.

Deployability,"rst, we explain what; we mean by a framework and then why it is an object-oriented; framework. ### What Is a Framework?. Programming inside a framework is a little like living in a city.; Plumbing, electricity, telephone, and transportation are services; provided by the city. In your house, you have interfaces to the; services such as light switches, electrical outlets, and telephones.; The details, for example, the routing algorithm of the phone switching; system, are transparent to you as the user. You do not care; you are; only interested in using the phone to communicate with your; collaborators to solve your domain specific problems. Programming outside of a framework may be compared to living in the; country. In order to have transportation and water, you will have to; build a road and dig a well. To have services like telephone and; electricity you will need to route the wires to your home. In; addition, you cannot build some things yourself. For example, you; cannot build a commercial airport on your patch of land. From a global; perspective, it would make no sense for everyone to build their; own airport. You see you will be very busy building the infrastructure; (or framework) before you can use the phone to communicate with your; collaborators and have a drink of water at the same time. In software; engineering, it is much the same way. In a framework, the basic; utilities and services, such as I/O and graphics, are provided. In; addition, ROOT being a HEP analysis framework, it provides a large; selection of HEP specific utilities such as histograms and fitting.; The drawback of a framework is that you are constrained to it, as you; are constraint to use the routing algorithm provided by your telephone; service. You also have to learn the framework interfaces, which in; this analogy is the same as learning how to use a telephone. If you are interested in doing physics, a good HEP framework will save; you much work.

All ``LoopPass`` execute on each :ref:`loop <loop-terminology>` in the function; independent of all of the other loops in the function. ``LoopPass`` processes; loops in loop nest order such that outer most loop is processed last. ``LoopPass`` subclasses are allowed to update loop nest using ``LPPassManager``; interface. Implementing a loop pass is usually straightforward.; ``LoopPass``\ es may override three virtual methods to do their work. All; these methods should return ``true`` if they modified the program, or ``false``; if they didn't. A ``LoopPass`` subclass which is intended to run as part of the main loop pass; pipeline needs to preserve all of the same *function* analyses that the other; loop passes in its pipeline require. To make that easier,; a ``getLoopAnalysisUsage`` function is provided by ``LoopUtils.h``. It can be; called within the subclass's ``getAnalysisUsage`` override to get consistent; and correct behavior.

No object lifetime extension; ----------------------------.

This rule is intended to prohibit ARC from observably extending the; lifetime of a retainable object, other than as specified in this; document. Together with the rule limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs. ARC's power to reorder the destruction of objects is critical to its; ability to do any optimization, for essentially the same reason that; it must retain the power to decrease the lifetime of an object.; Unfortunately, while it's generally poor style for the destruction; of objects to have arbitrary side-effects, it's certainly possible.; Hence the caveat. .. _arc.optimization.precise:.

Deployability,"run-time requires compiler support to; locate all places that hold live pointer variables at run-time, including the; :ref:`processor stack and registers <gcroot>`. Conservative garbage collection is attractive because it does not require any; special compiler support, but it does have problems. In particular, because the; conservative garbage collector cannot *know* that a particular word in the; machine is a pointer, it cannot move live objects in the heap (preventing the; use of compacting and generational GC algorithms) and it can occasionally suffer; from memory leaks due to integer values that happen to point to objects in the; program. In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective. In practice, however, the; locality and performance benefits of using aggressive garbage collection; techniques dominates any low-level losses. This document describes the mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------. LLVM's intermediate representation provides :ref:`garbage collection intrinsics; <gc_intrinsics>` that offer support for a broad class of collector models. For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more.

Deployability,"runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors requirements to the compiler. In particular,; LLVM provides support for generating stack maps at call sites, polling for a; safepoint, and emitting load and store barriers. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap. These are commonly; used to optimize incremental scans in generational collectors. * Emission of read barriers when loading object references. These are useful; for interoperating with concurrent collectors. There are additional areas that LLVM does not directly address:. * Registration of global roots with the runtime. * Registration of stack map entries with the runtime. * The functions used by the program to allocate memory, trigger a collection,; etc. * Computation or compilation of type maps, or registration of them with the; runtime. These are used to crawl the heap for object references. In general, LLVM's support for GC does not include features which can be; adequately addressed with other features of the IR and does not specify a; particular binary interface.

This tool, provided a binary or DSO, should infer whether; indirect control flow operations are protected by CFI, and should output these; results in a human-readable form. This tool should also be added as part of Clang's continuous integration testing; framework, where modifications to the compiler ensure that CFI protection; schemes are still present in the final binary. Location; ========. This tool will be present as a part of the LLVM toolchain, and will reside in; the ""/llvm/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"" directory, relative to the LLVM trunk. It will; be tested in two methods:. - Unit tests to validate code sections, present in; ""/llvm/unittests/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"".; - Integration tests, present in ""/llvm/tools/clang/test/LLVMCFIVerify"". These; integration tests are part of clang as part of a continuous integration; framework, ensuring updates to the compiler that reduce CFI coverage on; indirect control flow instructions are identified. Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review. These unexpected control flows may simply have not been accounted for in; the compiler implementation of CFI (e.g. indirect jumps to facilitate switch; statements may not be fully protected). It may be possible in the future to extend this tool to flag unnecessary CFI; directives (e.g. CFI directives around a static call to a non-polymorphic base; type).

Deployability,"ry footprint and execution time;; * Incremental adoption -- provide third-party code with an incremental; migration process for their codebases. ## Motivation. An implementation of the modules concepts exists in the LLVM frontend Clang used; as a library by ROOT [[2]]. Clang supports the Modules TS and hosts modules ; research and development work. The implementation encourages incremental, ; bottom-up [[3]] adoption of the modules feature. Modules in Clang are designed; to work for C, C++, ObjectiveC, ObjectiveC++ and Swift. Users can enable the; modules feature without modifications in header files. The LLVM compiler allows; users to specify module interfaces in dedicated file, called *module maps files*.; A module map file expresses the mapping between a module file and a collection; of header files. If the compiler finds such file in the include paths it; automatically generates, imports and uses module files. The module map files can; be mounted using the compiler's virtual file system overlay mechanism to; non-writable production library installations. In practice, a non-invasive *modularization* can be done easily by introducing; a module map file. ```cpp; // A.h ; int pow2(int x) {; return x * x;; }; ```; ```cpp; // B.cpp; #include ""A.h"" // clang rewires this to import A.; int main() {; return pow2(42);; }; ```. ```cpp; // A.h module interface, aka module map file; module A {; header ""A.h""; export * // clang exports the contents of A.h as part of module A.; }; ```. A.h defines *pow2*, the module map file instructs clang to create *A.pcm* and; import it in B.cpp. In a number of cases the module map files can be automatically generated if the; build system knows about the list of header files in every package. . ### Header parsing in ROOT. ```cpp; // A.h; #include <string>; #include <vector>; template <class T, class U = int> struct AStruct {; void doIt() { /*...*/ }; std::string Name; ; std::vector<U> Collection;; // ...; };. template<class T, class U = AStruc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:3029,install,installations,3029,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['install'],['installations']

Deployability,"s for OpenCL; ------------------------. There is ongoing work to support C++ standard libraries from `LLVM's libcxx; <https://libcxx.llvm.org/>`_ in OpenCL kernel code using C++ for OpenCL mode. It is currently possible to include `type_traits` from C++17 in the kernel; sources when the following clang extensions are enabled; ``__cl_clang_function_pointers`` and ``__cl_clang_variadic_functions``,; see :doc:`LanguageExtensions` for more details. The use of non-conformant; features enabled by the extensions does not expose non-conformant behavior; beyond the compilation i.e. does not get generated in IR or binary.; The extension only appear in metaprogramming; mechanism to identify or verify the properties of types. This allows to provide; the full C++ functionality without a loss of portability. To avoid unsafe use; of the extensions it is recommended that the extensions are disabled directly; after the header include. **Example of Use**:. The example of kernel code with `type_traits` is illustrated here. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : enable; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_variadic_functions : enable; #include <type_traits>; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : disable; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_variadic_functions : disable. using sint_type = std::make_signed<unsigned int>::type;. __kernel void foo() {; static_assert(!std::is_same<sint_type, unsigned int>::value);; }. The possible clang invocation to compile the example is as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -I<path to libcxx checkout or installation>/include test.clcpp. Note that `type_traits` is a header only library and therefore no extra; linking step against the standard libraries is required. See full example; in `Compiler Explorer <https://godbolt.org/z/5WbnTfb65>`_.

Deployability,"s genuine multidimensional minimization routine is usually much; slower than $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, but it does not use first derivatives,; so it should not be so sensitive to the precision of the; $\mbox{FCN}$ calculations, and is even rather robust with respect to; gross fluctuations in the function value. However, it gives no reliable; information about parameter errors, no information whatsoever about; parameter correlations, and worst of all cannot be expected to converge; accurately to the minimum in a finite time. Its estimate of the; *expected distance to the minimum* $\mbox{EDM}$ is largely fantasy,; so it would not even know if it did converge. ## Floating point precision ##. M figures out at execution time the machine precision [api:epsmac], and; assumes that $\mbox{FCN}$ provides about the same precision. That; means not just the length of the numbers used and returned by; $\mbox{FCN}$, but the actual mathematical accuracy of the; calculations. Section [install:epsmac] describes what to do if this is; not the case. ## Parameter limits ##. Putting limits (absolute bounds) on the allowed values for a given; parameter, causes M to make a non-linear transformation of its own; internal parameter values to obtain the (external) parameter values; passed to $\mbox{FCN}$. To understand the adverse effect of limits,; see [intro:limits]. Basically, the use of limits should be avoided unless needed to keep the; parameter inside a desired range. If parameter limits are needed, in spite of the effects described in; Chapter One, then the user should be aware of the following techniques; to alleviate problems caused by limits. ### Getting the Right Minimum with Limits ###. If $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ converges normally to a point where no parameter; is near one of its limits, then the existence of limits has probably not; prevented M from finding the right minimum. On the other hand, if one or; more parameters is near its limit at the minimum, this may be because; the true minimum is ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:63175,install,install,63175,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['install'],['install']

Building with CMake. ROOT can now be build using the CMake build system (version 2.8). ; The initial supported platforms are Linux(gcc), Windows (vc9), MacOSX(gcc). The installed libraries and executables should be compatible to the standard build of ROOT.  CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces (i.e. Xcode, Eclipse, Visual Studio) that can be used in the; compiler environment of your choice. The main difference with respect; the Module.mk build is that the build is done out of the source tree,; which allows several build configurations in parallel (debug,; non-debug, optional components, etc.).  The main advantage; with respect the standard build system is that for the Windows platform; it does not require the installaton of CygWin.; Here are the basic instructions: . mkdir <builddir>   # create a empty directory in which CMake will put temporary and binary files; cd <builddir>; cmake [options] <rootsources> # by default it will generate a Makefile (or NMake file on Windows); make [options] # you can use any standard make options (e.g. -jN); make install # installation to the source tree by default, use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to change it.

For ``__strong`` lvalues, moving is equivalent; to loading the lvalue with primitive semantics, writing a null pointer to it; with primitive semantics, and then releasing the result of the load at the end; of the current full-expression. For all other lvalues, moving is equivalent to; reading the object. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions:. Restrictions; ------------. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions.weak:.

It is undefined behavior to perform an operation with weak; assignment semantics with a pointer to an Objective-C object whose class does; not support ``__weak`` references. .. admonition:: Rationale. Historically, it has been possible for a class to provide its own; reference-count implementation by overriding ``retain``, ``release``, etc.; However, weak references to an object require coordination with its class's; reference-count implementation because, among other things, weak loads and; stores must be atomic with respect to the final release. Therefore, existing; custom reference-count implementations will generally not support weak; references without additional effort. This is unavoidable without breaking; binary compatibility. A class may indicate that it does not support weak references by providing the; ``objc_arc_weak_reference_unavailable`` attribute on the class's interface declaration. A; retainable object pointer type is **weak-unavailable** if; is a pointer to an (optionally protocol-qualified) Objective-C class ``T`` where; ``T`` or one of its superclasses has the ``objc_arc_weak_reference_unavailable``; attribute. A program is ill-formed if it applies the ``__weak`` ownership; qualifier to a weak-unavailable type or if the value operand of a weak; assignment operation has a weak-unavailable type. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions.autoreleasing:.

Multilib is a relatively small feature in the scheme of things so supporting it; should accordingly take little time. Where possible this should be achieved by; implementing it in terms of existing features in the LLVM codebase. Minimal additional API surface; ------------------------------. The greater the API surface, the greater the difficulty of keeping it stable.; Where possible the additional API surface should be kept small by defining it; in relation to existing APIs.

In general, a module is made up of a list of global values (where both; functions and global variables are global values). Global values are; represented by a pointer to a memory location (in this case, a pointer; to an array of char, and a pointer to a function), and have one of the; following :ref:`linkage types <linkage>`. .. _linkage:. Linkage Types; -------------. All Global Variables and Functions have one of the following types of; linkage:. ``private``; Global values with ""``private``"" linkage are only directly; accessible by objects in the current module. In particular, linking; code into a module with a private global value may cause the; private to be renamed as necessary to avoid collisions. Because the; symbol is private to the module, all references can be updated. This; doesn't show up in any symbol table in the object file.; ``internal``; Similar to private, but the value shows as a local symbol; (``STB_LOCAL`` in the case of ELF) in the object file. This; corresponds to the notion of the '``static``' keyword in C.; ``available_externally``; Globals with ""``available_externally``"" linkage are never emitted into; the object file corresponding to the LLVM module. From the linker's; perspective, an ``available_externally`` global is equivalent to; an external declaration. They exist to allow inlining and other; optimizations to take place given knowledge of the definition of the; global, which is known to be somewhere outside the module.

For example, suppose:. * ``<stdio.h>`` defines a macro ``getc`` (and exports its ``#define``); * ``<cstdio>`` imports the ``<stdio.h>`` module and undefines the macro (and exports its ``#undef``). The ``#undef`` overrides the ``#define``, and a source file that imports both modules *in any order* will not see ``getc`` defined as a macro. Module Map Language; ===================. .. warning::. The module map language is not currently guaranteed to be stable between major revisions of Clang. The module map language describes the mapping from header files to the; logical structure of modules. To enable support for using a library as; a module, one must write a ``module.modulemap`` file for that library. The; ``module.modulemap`` file is placed alongside the header files themselves,; and is written in the module map language described below. .. note::; For compatibility with previous releases, if a module map file named; ``module.modulemap`` is not found, Clang will also search for a file named; ``module.map``. This behavior is deprecated and we plan to eventually; remove it. As an example, the module map file for the C standard library might look a bit like this:. .. parsed-literal::. module std [system] [extern_c] {; module assert {; textual header ""assert.h""; header ""bits/assert-decls.h""; export *; }. module complex {; header ""complex.h""; export *; }. module ctype {; header ""ctype.h""; export *; }. module errno {; header ""errno.h""; header ""sys/errno.h""; export *; }. module fenv {; header ""fenv.h""; export *; }. // ...more headers follow...; }. Here, the top-level module ``std`` encompasses the whole C standard library. It has a number of submodules containing different parts of the standard library: ``complex`` for complex numbers, ``ctype`` for character types, etc. Each submodule lists one of more headers that provide the contents for that submodule.

For example, if the user specifies; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-m4`` the toolchain can choose a directory; containing headers and libraries suitable for Armv7E-M, because it knows that's; a suitable architecture for Arm Cortex-M4.; Multilib can also choose between libraries for the same architecture based on; other options. For example if the user specifies ``-fno-exceptions`` then a; toolchain could select libraries built without exception support, thereby; reducing the size of the resulting binary. Design; ======. Clang supports GCC's ``-print-multi-lib`` and ``-print-multi-directory``; options. These are described in; `GCC Developer Options <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/Developer-Options.html>`_.

Deployability,"s the probability of signal,; knowing `X`. ### Learning Methods. The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a; set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate,; divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all; methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first; derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the; well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this; derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the; weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the; product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the; output neuron (for a synapse). This computation is called; ""back-propagation of the errors"". Six learning methods are; implemented. #### Stochastic Minimization. This is the most trivial learning method. The Robbins-Monro stochastic; approximation is applied to multilayer perceptrons. The weights are; updated after each example according to the formula:. $$; w_{ij}(t+1) = w_{ij}(t) + \Delta w_{ij}(t); $$. with:. $$; \Delta w_{ij}(t) = - \eta \left(; \frac{\partial e_p}{\partial w_{ij}} + \delta \right) +; \epsilon \Delta w_{ij}(t-1); $$. The parameters for this method are `Eta`, `EtaDecay`, `Delta` and; `Epsilon`. #### Steepest Descent With Fixed Step Size (Batch Learning). It is the same as the stochastic minimization, but the weights are; updated after considering all the examples, with the total derivative; `dEdw`. The parameters for this method are `Eta`, `EtaDecay`, `Delta`; and `Epsilon`. #### Steepest Descent Algorithm. Weights are set to the minimum along the line defined by the gradient.; The only parameter for this method is `Tau`. Lower `Tau` = higher; precision = slower search. A value `Tau=3` seems reasonable. #### Conjugate Gradients With the Polak-Ribiere Updating Formula. Weights are set to the minimum along the line defined by the conjugate; gradient. Parameters are `Tau` and `Reset`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:72320,update,updated,72320,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"s the runtime to; patch the code at this point in response to an event triggered from; outside the code. The code for instructions following the stack map; may be emitted in the stack map's shadow, and these instructions may; be overwritten by destructive patching. Without shadow bytes, this; destructive patching could overwrite program text or data outside the; current function. We disallow overlapping stack map shadows so that; the runtime does not need to consider this corner case. For example, a stack map with 8 byte shadow:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void @runtime(); call void (i64, i32, ...) @llvm.experimental.stackmap(i64 77, i32 8,; ptr %ptr); %val = load i64, ptr %ptr; %add = add i64 %val, 3; ret i64 %add. May require one byte of nop-padding:. .. code-block:: none. 0x00 callq _runtime; 0x05 nop <--- stack map address; 0x06 movq (%rdi), %rax; 0x07 addq $3, %rax; 0x0a popq %rdx; 0x0b ret <---- end of 8-byte shadow. Now, if the runtime needs to invalidate the compiled code, it may; patch 8 bytes of code at the stack map's address at follows:. .. code-block:: none. 0x00 callq _runtime; 0x05 movl $0xffff, %rax <--- patched code at stack map address; 0x0a callq *%rax <---- end of 8-byte shadow. This way, after the normal call to the runtime returns, the code will; execute a patched call to a special entry point that can rebuild a; stack frame from the values located by the stack map.

Deployability,"s to isolate them from much; of the gore of the internal analysis engine. = How It Works =. The analyzer is inspired by several foundational research papers ([1],; [2]). (FIXME: kremenek to add more links). In a nutshell, the analyzer is basically a source code simulator that; traces out possible paths of execution. The state of the program; (values of variables and expressions) is encapsulated by the state; (ProgramState). A location in the program is called a program point; (ProgramPoint), and the combination of state and program point is a; node in an exploded graph (ExplodedGraph). The term ""exploded"" comes; from exploding the control-flow edges in the control-flow graph (CFG). Conceptually the analyzer does a reachability analysis through the; ExplodedGraph. We start at a root node, which has the entry program; point and initial state, and then simulate transitions by analyzing; individual expressions. The analysis of an expression can cause the; state to change, resulting in a new node in the ExplodedGraph with an; updated program point and an updated state. A bug is found by hitting; a node that satisfies some ""bug condition"" (basically a violation of a; checking invariant). The analyzer traces out multiple paths by reasoning about branches and; then bifurcating the state: on the true branch the conditions of the; branch are assumed to be true and on the false branch the conditions; of the branch are assumed to be false. Such ""assumptions"" create; constraints on the values of the program, and those constraints are; recorded in the ProgramState object (and are manipulated by the; ConstraintManager). If assuming the conditions of a branch would; cause the constraints to be unsatisfiable, the branch is considered; infeasible and that path is not taken. This is how we get; path-sensitivity. We reduce exponential blow-up by caching nodes. If; a new node with the same state and program point as an existing node; would get generated, the path ""caches out"" and we sim",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt:1613,update,updated,1613,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,2,['update'],['updated']

Under FatLTO the compiler can emit standard object files which contain both the; machine code in the ``.text`` section and LLVM bitcode in the ``.llvm.lto``; section. Overview; ========. Within LLVM, FatLTO is supported by choosing the ``FatLTODefaultPipeline``.; This pipeline will:. #) Run the pre-link (Thin)LTO pipeline on the current module.; #) Embed the pre-link bitcode in a special ``.llvm.lto`` section.; #) Finish optimizing the module using the ModuleOptimization pipeline.; #) Emit the object file, including the new ``.llvm.lto`` section. .. NOTE. Previously, we conservatively ran independent pipelines on separate copies; of the LLVM module to generate the bitcode section and the object code,; which happen to be identical to those used outside of FatLTO. While that; resulted in compiled artifacts that were identical to those produced by the; default and (Thin)LTO pipelines, module cloning led to some cases of; miscompilation, and we have moved away from trying to keep bitcode; generation and optimization completely disjoint. Bit-for-bit compatibility is not (and never was) a guarantee, and we reserve; the right to change this at any time. Explicitly, users should not rely on; the produced bitcode or object code to match their non-LTO counterparts; precisely. They will exhibit similar performance characteristics, but may; not be bit-for-bit the same. Internally, the ``.llvm.lto`` section is created by running the; ``EmbedBitcodePass`` after the ``ThinLTOPreLinkDefaultPipeline``. This pass is; responsible for emitting the ``.llvm.lto`` section. Afterwards, the; ``ThinLTODefaultPipeline`` runs and the compiler can emit the fat object file. Limitations; ===========. Linkers; -------. Currently, using LTO with LLVM fat lto objects is supported by LLD and by the; GNU linkers via :doc:`GoldPlugin`.

Asserts are always enabled for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and `dev=ON`.

One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""drawing"", obj2, ""colz"");; ```. The `redraw` function will call `draw` if the drawing was not performed before.

Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``.

Deployability,"sal is *Not* About; =================================. Changing the development policy. This proposal relates only to moving the hosting of our source-code repository; from SVN hosted on our own servers to Git hosted on GitHub. We are not proposing; using GitHub's issue tracker, pull-requests, or code-review. Contributors will continue to earn commit access on demand under the Developer; Policy, except that that a GitHub account will be required instead of SVN; username/password-hash. Why Git, and Why GitHub?; ========================. Why Move At All?; ----------------. This discussion began because we currently host our own Subversion server; and Git mirror on a voluntary basis. The LLVM Foundation sponsors the server and; provides limited support, but there is only so much it can do. Volunteers are not sysadmins themselves, but compiler engineers that happen; to know a thing or two about hosting servers. We also don't have 24/7 support,; and we sometimes wake up to see that continuous integration is broken because; the SVN server is either down or unresponsive. We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free. Why Git?; --------. Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used; SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape; of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and; fostering collaboration. Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the; sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git; through the Git-SVN integration. Git allows you to:. * Commit, squash, merge, and fork locally without touching the remote server.; * Maintain local branches, enabling multiple threads of development.; * Collaborate on these branches (e.g. through your own fork of llvm on",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst:1736,continuous,continuous,1736,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,2,"['continuous', 'integrat']","['continuous', 'integration']"

This disallows reordering of ``monotonic`` (or; stronger) operations on the same address. If an address is written; ``monotonic``-ally by one thread, and other threads ``monotonic``-ally; read that address repeatedly, the other threads must eventually see; the write. This corresponds to the C/C++ ``memory_order_relaxed``.; ``acquire``; In addition to the guarantees of ``monotonic``, a; *synchronizes-with* edge may be formed with a ``release`` operation.; This is intended to model C/C++'s ``memory_order_acquire``.; ``release``; In addition to the guarantees of ``monotonic``, if this operation; writes a value which is subsequently read by an ``acquire``; operation, it *synchronizes-with* that operation. Furthermore,; this occurs even if the value written by a ``release`` operation; has been modified by a read-modify-write operation before being; read. (Such a set of operations comprises a *release; sequence*).

Each; sequentially-consistent read sees the last preceding write to the; same address in this global order. This corresponds to the C/C++; ``memory_order_seq_cst`` and Java ``volatile``. Note: this global total order is *not* guaranteed to be fully; consistent with the *happens-before* partial order if; non-``seq_cst`` accesses are involved.

Deployability,"save; all of the flags besides the overflow flag in a register rather than on the; stack. We can then use `seto` and `add` to save and restore the overflow flag; in a register. Combined, this will save and restore flags in the same manner as; above but using two registers rather than the stack. That is still very; expensive if slightly less expensive than `pushf` and `popf` in most cases. ###### A flag-less alternative on Haswell, Zen and newer processors. Starting with the BMI2 x86 instruction set extensions available on Haswell and; Zen processors, there is an instruction for shifting that does not set any; flags: `shrx`. We can use this and the `lea` instruction to implement analogous; code sequences to the above ones. However, these are still very marginally; slower, as there are fewer ports able to dispatch shift instructions in most; modern x86 processors than there are for `or` instructions. Fast, single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shrxq %rax, %rsi, %rsi # Shift away bits if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9. This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets.

Deployability,"se PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/usr/include``, create a subdirectory; ``build/usr/include`` and place the header ``mylib.h`` into that; subdirectory. If ``mylib.h`` depends on other headers, then they can be; stored within ``build/usr/include`` in a way that mimics the installed; location. Building a relocatable precompiled header requires two additional; arguments. First, pass the ``--relocatable-pch`` flag to indicate that; the resulting PCH file should be relocatable. Second, pass; ``-isysroot /path/to/build``, which makes all includes for your library; relative to the build directory. For example:. .. code-block:: console. # clang -x c-header --relocatable-pch -isysroot /path/to/build /path/to/build/mylib.h mylib.h.pch. When loading the relocatable PCH file, the various headers used in the; PCH file are found from the system header roo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:48418,install,installed,48418,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['install'],['installed']

A description of how these pointers work is given under; the \ref ptpo ""Pointers to persistent objects"" heading below. ### ""application"" layer record types. These are either user defined record types, or record types supplied; by ROOT that are not needed by ROOTIO. The format of such an object that; uses the default streamer is shown in \ref dobject. ## Data compression. The user can set the data compression level for new or modified data records; when creating or opening a file. When an existing file is opened for update,; the compression level selected need not match that used previously. The; compression level of existing records is not modified unless the record itself; is modified. There are ten compression levels, 0-9, ranging from 0 (no compression) to 9; (maximum compression), with level 1 being the default. The level chosen is; a tradeoff between disk space and compression performance. The decompression; speed is independent of level. Currently, in release 3.2.6, level 2 is not used.; If level 2 is selected, level 1 is used with no notification to the user. The chosen compression level is not applied to the entire file. The following; portions of the file are not compressed, regardless of the compression level; selected:. 1. the file header; 2. the KeysList data record; 3. the FreeSegments data record; 4. any data record (outside of a TTree) where the uncompressed size of; the data portion is 256 bytes or less.; 5. the key portion of any data record. Furthermore, the data portion of the StreamerInfo data record is always; compressed at level 1 (if over 256 bytes uncompressed), regardless of the; compression level selected (even if no compression is selected). The compression algorithm used is an in memory ZIP compression written for the; DELPHI collaboration at CERN. Its author is E. Chernyaev (IHEP/Protvino).; The source code is internal to ROOTIO. \anchor si; ## StreamerInfo.

This will generate source tarballs for each LLVM project being validated, which; can be uploaded to github for further testing. Build The Binary Distribution; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Creating the binary distribution requires following the instructions; :doc:`here <ReleaseProcess>`. That process will perform both Release+Asserts and Release builds but only; pack the Release build for upload. You should use the Release+Asserts sysroot,; normally under ``final/Phase3/Release+Asserts/llvmCore-3.8.1-RCn.install/``,; for test-suite and run-time benchmarks, to make sure nothing serious has; passed through the net. For compile-time benchmarks, use the Release version. The minimum required version of the tools you'll need are :doc:`here <GettingStarted>`. Release Qualification Criteria; ------------------------------. There are no official release qualification criteria. It is up to the; the release manager to determine when a release is ready. The release manager; should pay attention to the results of community testing, the number of outstanding; bugs, and then number of regressions when determining whether or not to make a; release. The community values time based releases, so releases should not be delayed for; too long unless there are critical issues remaining. In most cases, the only; kind of bugs that are critical enough to block a release would be a major regression; from a previous release. Official Testing; ----------------. A few developers in the community have dedicated time to validate the release; candidates and volunteered to be the official release testers for each; architecture. These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important.

Next we; initialize our CompileLayer. The CompileLayer needs three things: (1) A; reference to the ExecutionSession, (2) A reference to our object layer, and (3); a compiler instance to use to perform the actual compilation from IR to object; files. We use the off-the-shelf ConcurrentIRCompiler utility as our compiler,; which we construct using this constructor's JITTargetMachineBuilder argument.; The ConcurrentIRCompiler utility will use the JITTargetMachineBuilder to build; llvm TargetMachines (which are not thread safe) as needed for compiles. After; this, we initialize our supporting members: ``DL``, ``Mangler`` and ``Ctx`` with; the input DataLayout, the ExecutionSession and DL member, and a new default; constructed LLVMContext respectively. Now that our members have been initialized,; so the one thing that remains to do is to tweak the configuration of the; *JITDylib* that we will store our code in. We want to modify this dylib to; contain not only the symbols that we add to it, but also the symbols from our; REPL process as well. We do this by attaching a; ``DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator`` instance using the; ``DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator::GetForCurrentProcess`` method. .. code-block:: c++. static Expected<std::unique_ptr<KaleidoscopeJIT>> Create() {; auto JTMB = JITTargetMachineBuilder::detectHost();. if (!JTMB); return JTMB.takeError();. auto DL = JTMB->getDefaultDataLayoutForTarget();; if (!DL); return DL.takeError();. return std::make_unique<KaleidoscopeJIT>(std::move(*JTMB), std::move(*DL));; }. const DataLayout &getDataLayout() const { return DL; }.

Then one can use JSROOT to read such files and display objects in a web browser. There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>. Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files.

Of course, GUIs, IDEs, etc. that work with [CMake] will work with this package. The standard method of CMake building, with a build directory inside the Minuit2 source directory and using the makefile generator, would look like:. ```bash; cd PATH_TO_MINUIT2_SOURCE; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; ```. The standard [CMake] variables, such as `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, work with Minuit2. There are two other options:. * `minuit2_mpi` activates the (outdated C++) MPI bindings.; * `minuit2_omp` activates OpenMP (make sure all FCNs are threadsafe). ## Testing. You can run `ctest` or `make test` to run the Minuit2 test suite. ## Installing or using in another package. You can install the package using `cmake --build --target install .` (or `make install` if directly using the make system), or you can use it from the build directory. You can also include it in another CMake project using `add_subdirectory()` and linking to the `Minuit2` target. Since this package also exports targets, `find_package(Minuit2)` will also work once this package is built or installed. (For the curious, CMake adds a config script to `~/.cmake/packages` when building or; `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/cmake/Modules` when installing a package that has export commands.). To repeat; using this in your own CMake project usually amounts to:. ```cmake; find_package(Minuit2); # OR; add_subdirectory(Minuit2). target_link_libraries(MyExeOrLib PUBLIC Minuit2::Minuit2); ```. You do not need to add include directories or anything else for Minuit2; the CMake target system handles all of this for you. ## Packaging.

This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,; release |release|. Here we describe the status of LLVM, including major improvements; from the previous release, improvements in various subprojects of LLVM, and; some of the current users of the code. All LLVM releases may be downloaded; from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_. For more information about LLVM, including information about the latest; release, please check out the `main LLVM web site <https://llvm.org/>`_. If you; have questions or comments, the `Discourse forums; <https://discourse.llvm.org>`_ is a good place to ask; them. Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the main; LLVM web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not the current; one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please see the `releases; page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_. Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release; =================================================; .. NOTE; For small 1-3 sentence descriptions, just add an entry at the end of; this list. If your description won't fit comfortably in one bullet; point (e.g. maybe you would like to give an example of the; functionality, or simply have a lot to talk about), see the `NOTE` below; for adding a new subsection. * ...

There are unfortunately exceptions to this general approach, such as:. * The first declaration of a redeclarable entity maintains a pointer to the; most recent declaration of that entity, which naturally needs to change as; more declarations are parsed.; * Name lookup tables in declaration contexts change after the namespace; declaration is formed.; * We attempt to maintain only a single declaration for an instantiation of a; template, rather than having distinct declarations for an instantiation of; the declaration versus the definition, so template instantiation often; updates parts of existing declarations.; * Some parts of declarations are required to be instantiated separately (this; includes default arguments and exception specifications), and such; instantiations update the existing declaration. These cases tend to be fragile; mutable AST state should be avoided where; possible. As a consequence of this design principle, we typically do not provide setters; for AST state. (Some are provided for short-term modifications intended to be; used immediately after an AST node is created and before it's ""published"" as; part of the complete AST, or where language semantics require after-the-fact; updates.). Faithfulness; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The AST intends to provide a representation of the program that is faithful to; the original source. We intend for it to be possible to write refactoring tools; using only information stored in, or easily reconstructible from, the Clang AST.; This means that the AST representation should either not desugar source-level; constructs to simpler forms, or -- where made necessary by language semantics; or a clear engineering tradeoff -- should desugar minimally a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:59424,update,update,59424,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['update'],['update']

Two example data sources have been provided: the TRootDS and the TTrivialDS. The former allows to read via the novel data source mechanism ROOT data, while the latter is a simple generator, created for testing and didactic purposes. It is therefore now possible to interface *any* kind of dataset/data format to ROOT as long as an adaptor which implements the pure virtual methods of the TDataSource interface can be written in C++.; - TDF can now read CSV files through a specialized TDataSource.

You can use the `clang-format-diff.py`_ or `git-clang-format`_ tools to automatically format your patch properly.; * not contain any unrelated changes; * be an isolated change. Independent changes should be submitted as separate patches as this makes reviewing easier.; * have a single commit (unless stacked on another Differential), up-to-date with the upstream ``origin/main`` branch, and don't have merges. .. _format patches:. Before sending a patch for review, please also try to ensure it is; formatted properly. We use ``clang-format`` for this, which has git integration; through the ``git-clang-format`` script. On some systems, it may already be; installed (or be installable via your package manager). If so, you can simply; run it -- the following command will format only the code changed in the most; recent commit:. .. code-block:: console. % git clang-format HEAD~1.

Clang frontend; --------------. The Clang frontend (``clang -cc1``) is used to compile C family languages. The; command-line interface of the frontend is considered to be an implementation; detail, intentionally has no external documentation, and is subject to change; without notice. Language frontends for other languages; --------------------------------------. Clang can be provided with inputs written in non-C-family languages. In such; cases, an external tool will be used to compile the input. The; currently-supported languages are:. * Ada (``-x ada``, ``.ad[bs]``); * Fortran (``-x f95``, ``.f``, ``.f9[05]``, ``.for``, ``.fpp``, case-insensitive); * Java (``-x java``). In each case, GCC will be invoked to compile the input. Assembler; ---------. Clang can either use LLVM's integrated assembler or an external system-specific; tool (for instance, the GNU Assembler on GNU OSes) to produce machine code from; assembly.; By default, Clang uses LLVM's integrated assembler on all targets where it is; supported. If you wish to use the system assembler instead, use the; ``-fno-integrated-as`` option. Linker; ------. Clang can be configured to use one of several different linkers:. * GNU ld; * GNU gold; * LLVM's `lld <https://lld.llvm.org>`_; * MSVC's link.exe. Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold. The default linker varies between targets, and can be overridden via the; ``-fuse-ld=<linker name>`` flag. Runtime libraries; =================.

The functionality of an application can be enriched by embedding Cling. To embed Cling, the main program has to be provided. One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from any anywhere within the application.

Clang supports generation of SPIR-V conformant to `the OpenCL Environment; Specification; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Env.html>`_. To generate SPIR-V binaries, Clang uses the external ``llvm-spirv`` tool from the; `SPIRV-LLVM-Translator repo; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator>`_. Prior to the generation of SPIR-V binary with Clang, ``llvm-spirv``; should be built or installed. Please refer to `the following instructions; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#build-instructions>`_; for more details. Clang will expect the ``llvm-spirv`` executable to; be present in the ``PATH`` environment variable. Clang uses ``llvm-spirv``; with `the widely adopted assembly syntax package; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/#build-with-spirv-tools>`_. `The versioning; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/releases>`_ of; ``llvm-spirv`` is aligned with Clang major releases. The same applies to the; main development branch. It is therefore important to ensure the ``llvm-spirv``; version is in alignment with the Clang version. For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively. This file can be imported; by an OpenCL driver that support SPIR-V consumption or it can be compiled; further by offline SPIR-V consumer tools. Converting to SPIR-V produced with the optimization levels other than `-O0` is; currently available as an experimental feature and it is not guaranteed to work; in all cases.

If the garbage collector wishes to move any object, the; compiler must provide a mapping, for each pointer, to an indication of; its allocation. To simplify the interaction between a collector and the compiled code,; most garbage collectors are organized in terms of three abstractions:; load barriers, store barriers, and safepoints. #. A load barrier is a bit of code executed immediately after the; machine load instruction, but before any use of the value loaded.; Depending on the collector, such a barrier may be needed for all; loads, merely loads of a particular type (in the original source; language), or none at all. #. Analogously, a store barrier is a code fragment that runs; immediately before the machine store instruction, but after the; computation of the value stored. The most common use of a store; barrier is to update a 'card table' in a generational garbage; collector. #. A safepoint is a location at which pointers visible to the compiled; code (i.e. currently in registers or on the stack) are allowed to; change. After the safepoint completes, the actual pointer value; may differ, but the 'object' (as seen by the source language); pointed to will not. Note that the term 'safepoint' is somewhat overloaded. It refers to; both the location at which the machine state is parsable and the; coordination protocol involved in bring application threads to a; point at which the collector can safely use that information. The; term ""statepoint"" as used in this document refers exclusively to the; former. This document focuses on the last item - compiler support for; safepoints in generated code.

Every patch should be reviewed by at least one technical expert in the areas of; the project affected by the change. Splitting Requests and Conditional Acceptance; ---------------------------------------------. Reviewers may request certain aspects of a patch to be broken out into separate; patches for independent review. Reviewers may also accept a patch; conditioned on the author providing a follow-up patch addressing some; particular issue or concern (although no committed patch should leave the; project in a broken state).

The substitution's current position in the substitution; list does not change so that expansion order relative to other existing; substitutions is preserved. The following properties apply to both the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:``; directives:. - **Substitution name**: In the directive, whitespace immediately before or; after ``%{name}`` is optional and discarded. ``%{name}`` must start with; ``%{``, it must end with ``}``, and the rest must start with a letter or; underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and; colons. This syntax has a few advantages:. - It is impossible for ``%{name}`` to contain sequences that are special in; python's ``re.sub`` patterns. Otherwise, attempting to specify; ``%{name}`` as a substitution pattern in a lit configuration file could; produce confusing expansions.; - The braces help avoid the possibility that another substitution's pattern; will match part of ``%{name}`` or vice-versa, producing confusing; expansions. However, the patterns of substitutions defined by lit; configuration files and by lit itself are not restricted to this form, so; overlaps are still theoretically possible. - **Substitution value**: The value includes all text from the first; non-whitespace character after ``=`` to the last non-whitespace character. If; there is no non-whitespace character after ``=``, the value is the empty; string. Escape sequences that can appear in python ``re.sub`` replacement; strings are treated as plain text in the value.; - **Line continuations**: If the last non-whitespace character on the line after; ``:`` is ``\``, then the next directive must use the same directive keyword; (e.g., ``DEFINE:``) , and it is an error if there is no additional directive.; That directive s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:34213,configurat,configuration,34213,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

The best possibility to organize the monitoring of data from a running application; is to use THttpServer. In such case the client can always access the latest; changes and request only the items currently displayed in the browser.; To enable monitoring, one should activate the appropriate checkbox or; provide __monitoring__ parameter in the URL string like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/httpserver.C/Files/job1.root/hprof/draw.htm?monitoring=1000>. The parameter value is the update interval in milliseconds. ### JSON file-based monitoring. Solid file-based monitoring (without integration of THttpServer into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class,; which is capable to convert any (beside TTree) ROOT object into JSON. Any ROOT application can use such class to; create JSON files for selected objects and write such files in a directory,; which can be accessed via web server.

There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>.

Loop pre-header insertion guarantees that there is a single, non-critical entry; edge from outside of the loop to the loop header. This simplifies a number of; analyses and transformations, such as :ref:`LICM <passes-licm>`. Loop exit-block insertion guarantees that all exit blocks from the loop (blocks; which are outside of the loop that have predecessors inside of the loop) only; have predecessors from inside of the loop (and are thus dominated by the loop; header). This simplifies transformations such as store-sinking that are built; into LICM. This pass also guarantees that loops will have exactly one backedge. Note that the :ref:`simplifycfg <passes-simplifycfg>` pass will clean up blocks; which are split out but end up being unnecessary, so usage of this pass should; not pessimize generated code. This pass obviously modifies the CFG, but updates loop information and; dominator information. ``loop-unroll``: Unroll loops; -----------------------------. This pass implements a simple loop unroller. It works best when loops have; been canonicalized by the :ref:`indvars <passes-indvars>` pass, allowing it to; determine the trip counts of loops easily. ``loop-unroll-and-jam``: Unroll and Jam loops; ---------------------------------------------.

In certain cases we; want some header files to be compiled within C context or with RTTI on/off.; That's mostly for bootstrapping ROOT (aka rootcling stage1).; * modulemap.overlay.yaml -- automatically created virtual filesystem overlay; file. This file introduces C++ Modules for external dependencies.; For example, to 'modularize' glibc for ROOT we would need to place a modulemap; file in (usually) `/usr/include`. This folder is not writable on many; platforms. The vfs file tells the compiler to pretend there is a file at a; specific location. This way we 'mount' `/usr/include/module.modulemap`; non-invasively. The reasons why we need to extend the C++ modules support; beyond ROOT is described bellow.; * rootcling -cxxmodule creates a single artifact *Name.pcm* after the library; name. At a final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct. In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches.

Clang does not implement every pragma or declspec provided; by MSVC, but the popular ones, such as ``__declspec(dllexport)`` and ``#pragma; comment(lib)`` are well supported. clang has a ``-fms-compatibility`` flag that makes clang accept enough; invalid C++ to be able to parse most Microsoft headers. For example, it; allows `unqualified lookup of dependent base class members; <https://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup_bases>`_, which is; a common compatibility issue with clang. This flag is enabled by default; for Windows targets. ``-fdelayed-template-parsing`` lets clang delay parsing of function template; definitions until the end of a translation unit. This flag is enabled by; default for Windows targets. For compatibility with existing code that compiles with MSVC, clang defines the; ``_MSC_VER`` and ``_MSC_FULL_VER`` macros. When on Windows, these default to; either the same value as the currently installed version of cl.exe, or ``1933``; and ``193300000`` (respectively). The ``-fms-compatibility-version=`` flag; overrides these values. It accepts a dotted version tuple, such as 19.00.23506.; Changing the MSVC compatibility version makes clang behave more like that; version of MSVC.

Deployability,"ss manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines. Different tools have; different ways of loading dynamic pass plugins. For example, ``opt; -load-pass-plugin=path/to/plugin.so`` loads a pass plugin into ``opt``. For; information on writing a pass plugin, see :doc:`WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass`. Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses.

One of the main features of the LLVM Pass Framework is that it; schedules passes to run in an efficient way based on the constraints that your; pass meets (which are indicated by which class they derive from). We start by showing you how to construct a pass, everything from setting up the; code, to compiling, loading, and executing it. After the basics are down, more; advanced features are discussed. .. warning::; This document deals with the legacy pass manager. LLVM uses the new pass; manager for the optimization pipeline (the codegen pipeline; still uses the legacy pass manager), which has its own way of defining; passes. For more details, see :doc:`WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass` and; :doc:`NewPassManager`. Quick Start --- Writing hello world; ===================================.

Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/usr/include``, create a subdirectory; ``build/usr/include`` and place the header ``mylib.h`` into that; subdirectory. If ``mylib.h`` depends on other headers, then they can be; stored within ``build/usr/include`` in a way that mimics the installed; location. Building a relocatable precompiled header requires two additional; arguments. First, pass the ``--relocatable-pch`` flag to indicate that; the resulting PCH file should be relocatable. Second, pass; ``-isysroot /path/to/build``, which makes all includes for your library; relative to the build directory. For example:. .. code-block:: console. # clang -x c-header --relocatable-pch -isysroot /path/to/build",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:48287,install,installed,48287,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['install'],['installed']

Default values for these options are auto.; `freetype` finds `libpng` and `libbzip2` on the system and builds extra; modules. Then attempting to link against `freetype` one would need to link; `-lpng -lbzip2` explicitly otherwise linking will returns in undefined; references. Otherwise we would need to check for `libpng` and `libbzip2` on the system; and adjust `FREETYPE_LIBRARIES` to include `-lpng` and `-lbzip2`.; The current solution goes for the minimal configuration.

Deployability,"stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm. There are several additional options that the cache file also accepts to modify; the build, particularly the PGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO option. Setting this option to; Thin or Full will enable ThinLTO or full LTO respectively, further enhancing; the performance gains from a PGO build by enabling interprocedural; optimizations. For example, to run a CMake configuration for a PGO build; that also enables ThinTLO, use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin \; <path to source>/llvm. By default, clang will generate profile data by compiling a simple; hello world program. You can also tell clang use an external; project for generating profile data that may be a better fit for your; use case.

Deployability,"stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``. For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2. And the checks are different:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; SSE2: @test1; ; SSE2: psubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0; ; AVX1: @test1; ; AVX1: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0; ; AVX2: @test1; ; AVX2: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0.

Each item in the list is a tuple; consisting of a pattern and its replacement, which lit applies using python's; ``re.sub`` function.; - To define substitutions within a single test file, lit supports the; ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives, described in detail below. So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-version=51 %{cflags} \; ; DEFINE: -emit-llvm -o - %s | \; ; DEFINE: FileCheck %{fcflags} %s.

Deployability,"struction's memory access to go to; the specified segment. LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code. The GS-segment is; represented by address space 256, the FS-segment is represented by address space; 257, and the SS-segment is represented by address space 258. Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations). Special address spaces, in contrast, apply to static types. Every load and store; has a particular address space in its address operand type, and this is what; determines which address space is accessed. LLVM ignores these special address; space qualifiers on global variables, and does not provide a way to directly; allocate storage in them. At the LLVM IR level, the behavior of these special; address spaces depends in part on the underlying OS or runtime environment, and; they are specific to x86 (and LLVM doesn't yet handle them correctly in some; cases). Some operating systems and runtime environments use (or may in the future use); the FS/GS-segment registers for various low-level purposes, so care should be; taken when considering them.

Deployability,"sub-pads; and repaints the pads declared modified. In compiled code or in a long macro, you may want to access an object; created during the paint process. To do so, you can force the painting; with a `TCanvas::Update()`. For example, a **`TGraph`** creates a; histogram (**`TH1`**) to paint itself. In this case the internal; histogram obtained with `TGraph::GetHistogram()` is created only after; the pad is painted. The pad is painted automatically after the script is; finished executing or if you force the painting with `TPad::Modified()`; followed by a `TCanvas::Update()`. Note that it is not necessary to call; `TPad::Modified()` after a call to `Draw()`. The ""bit-modified"" is set; automatically by `Draw()`. A note about the ""bit-modified"" in sub pads:; when you want to update a sub pad in your canvas, you need to call; `pad->Modified()` rather than `canvas->Modified()`, and follow it with a; `canvas->Update()`. If you use `canvas->Modified()`, followed by a call; to `canvas->Update()`, the sub pad has not been declared modified and it; will not be updated. Also note that a call to `pad->Update()` where pad; is a sub pad of canvas, calls `canvas->Update()` and recursively updates; all the pads on the canvas. ### Making a Pad Transparent. As we will see in the paragraph ""Fill Attributes"", a fill style (type of; hatching) may be set for a pad. ``` {.cpp}; root[] pad1->SetFillStyle(istyle); ```. This is done with the `SetFillStyle` method where `istyle` is a style; number, defined in ""Fill Attributes"". A special set of styles allows; handling of various levels of transparency. These are styles number 4000; to 4100, 4000 being fully transparent and 4100 fully opaque. So, suppose; you have an existing canvas with several pads. You create a new pad; (transparent) covering for example the entire canvas. Then you draw your; primitives in this pad. The same can be achieved with the graphics; editor. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x tutorials/hist/h1draw.C; root[] TPad *n",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:27981,update,updated,27981,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['update'],['updated']

What About Branches and Merges?; -------------------------------. In contrast to SVN, Git makes branching easy. Git's commit history is; represented as a DAG, a departure from SVN's linear history. However, we propose; to mandate making merge commits illegal in our canonical Git repository. Unfortunately, GitHub does not support server side hooks to enforce such a; policy. We must rely on the community to avoid pushing merge commits. GitHub offers a feature called `Status Checks`: a branch protected by; `status checks` requires commits to be explicitly allowed before the push can happen.; We could supply a pre-push hook on the client side that would run and check the; history, before allowing the commit being pushed [statuschecks]_.; However this solution would be somewhat fragile (how do you update a script; installed on every developer machine?) and prevents SVN access to the; repository.

SJLJ exceptions, ""-fsjlj-exceptions"", are the only currently supported model. link.exe (the MS linker) is unsuitable as it doesn't support auto-importing which; is currently required to link correctly. However, if that limitation is removed; then there are no other known issues with using link.exe. Currently, there is a lack of a usable Windows compiler driver for Windows Itanium.; A reasonable work-around is to build clang with a windows-msvc default target and; then override the triple with e.g. ""-Xclang -triple -Xclang x86_64-unknown-windows-itanium"".; The linker can be specified with: ""-fuse-ld=lld"". In the Itanium C++ ABI the first member of an object is a pointer to the vtable; for its class. The vtable is often emitted into the object file with the key function; and must be imported for classes marked dllimport. The pointers must be globally; unique. Unfortunately, the COFF/PE file format does not provide a mechanism to; store a runtime address from another DLL into this pointer (although runtime; addresses are patched into the IAT). Therefore, the compiler must emit some code,; that runs after IAT patching but before anything that might use the vtable pointers,; and sets the vtable pointer to the address from the IAT. For the special case of; the references to vtables for __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info from typeinto objects; there is no declaration available to the compiler so this can't be done. To allow; programs to link we currently rely on the -auto-import switch in LLD to auto-import; references to __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info pointers (see: https://reviews.llvm.org/D43184; for a related discussion). This allows for linking; but, code that actually uses; such fields will not work as they these will not be fixed up at runtime.

To add a new peripheral component, send an RFC to the appropriate dev list; proposing its addition and explaining how it will meet the support requirements; listed above. Different types of components could require different levels of; detail. when in doubt, ask the community what's the best approach. Inclusion must reach consensus in the RFC by the community and the approval of; the corresponding review (by multiple members of the community) is the official; note of acceptance. After merge, there often is a period of transition, where teething issues on; existing buildbots are discovered and fixed. If those cannot be fixed straight; away, the sub-community is responsible for tracking and reverting all the; pertinent patches and retrying the inclusion review. Once the component is stable in tree, it must follow this policy and the; deprecation rules below apply. Due to the uncertain nature of inclusion, it's advisable that new components; are not added too close to a release branch. The time will depend on the size; and complexity of the component, so adding release and testing managers on the; RFC and review is strongly advisable. Deprecation Policy; ==================. The LLVM code base has a number of files that aren't being actively maintained.; But not all of those files are obstructing the development of the project and; so it remains in the repository with the assumption that it could still be; useful for downstream users.

To see whether gold is the default; on your system, run ``/usr/bin/ld -v``. It will report ""GNU; gold"" or else ""GNU ld"" if not. If gold is already installed at; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold``, one option is to simply make that the default by; backing up your existing ``/usr/bin/ld`` and creating a symbolic link; with ``ln -s /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld``. Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support. If not, and you get an error such as ""unknown option"",; then you will either need to build gold or install a version with plugin; support. * Download, configure and build gold with plugin support:. .. code-block:: bash. $ git clone --depth 1 git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GoldPlugin.rst:1201,install,installed,1201,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GoldPlugin.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GoldPlugin.rst,1,['install'],['installed']

Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance.

For rootcint or rootcling use:. ``` {.cpp}; sometype datamember; //!

These sections describe the ensamble of; the autoload keys related to one or more shared libraries. An autoload key; can be a class name, a namespace name, a typedef or alias or a header file name.; - Single line comments, which start with a ""#"" character. At ROOT startup, a check is performed on autoload keys.

Unlike with the single distribution setup, when building multiple distributions,; any components specified in *LLVM_RUNTIME_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* are not; automatically added to any distribution. Instead, you must include the targets; explicitly in some *LLVM_<distribution>_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* list. By default, each target can appear in multiple distributions; a target will be; installed as part of all distributions it appears in, and it'll be exported by; the last distribution it appears in (the order of distributions is the order; they appear in *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS*). We also define some umbrella targets (e.g.; ``llvm-libraries`` to install all LLVM libraries); a target can appear in a; different distribution than its umbrella, in which case the target will be; exported by the distribution it appears in (and not the distribution its; umbrella appears in). Set *LLVM_STRICT_DISTRIBUTIONS* to ``On`` if you want to; enforce a target appearing in only one distribution and umbrella distributions; being consistent with target distributions.

When contributors submit a patch to an LLVM project, other developers with; commit access may commit it for the author once appropriate (based on the; progression of code review, etc.). When doing so, it is important to retain; correct attribution of contributions to their contributors. However, we do not; want the source code to be littered with random attributions ""this code written; by J. Random Hacker"" (this is noisy and distracting). In practice, the revision; control system keeps a perfect history of who changed what, and the CREDITS.txt; file describes higher-level contributions. If you commit a patch for someone; else, please follow the attribution of changes in the simple manner as outlined; by the `commit messages`_ section. Overall, please do not add contributor names; to the source code. Also, don't commit patches authored by others unless they have submitted the; patch to the project or you have been authorized to submit them on their behalf; (you work together and your company authorized you to contribute the patches,; etc.). The author should first submit them to the relevant project's commit; list, development list, or LLVM bug tracker component. If someone sends you; a patch privately, encourage them to submit it to the appropriate list first. Our previous version control system (subversion) did not distinguish between the; author and the committer like git does. As such, older commits used a different; attribution mechanism. The previous method was to include ""Patch by John Doe.""; in a separate line of the commit message and there are automated processes that; rely on this format. .. _IR backwards compatibility:.

For example, a multilib variant could be compiled with ``-fno-exceptions``.; This option doesn't affect the content of header files, nor does it affect the; C libraries. Therefore if multilib layering is supported by the ToolChain; subclass and a suitable base multilib variant is present then the; ``-fno-exceptions`` multilib variant need only contain C++ libraries. It is the responsibility of layered multilib authors to ensure that headers and; libraries in each layer are complete enough to mask any incompatibilities. Stability; =========. Multilib via configuration file shall be considered an experimental feature; until LLVM 18, at which point ``-print-multi-flags-experimental``; should be renamed to ``-print-multi-flags``.; A toolchain can opt in to using this feature by including a ``multilib.yaml``; file in its distribution, once support for it is added in relevant ToolChain; subclasses.; Once stability is reached, flags emitted by ``-print-multi-flags``; should not be removed or changed, although new flags may be added. Restrictions; ============. Despite the name, multilib is used to locate both ``include`` and ``lib``; directories. Therefore it is important that consistent options are passed to; the Clang driver when both compiling and linking. Otherwise inconsistent; ``include`` and ``lib`` directories may be used, and the results will be; undefined. EXPERIMENTAL multilib.yaml; ==========================.

Deployability,"t over the network. This; is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is worthwhile to emphasize; the need and advantage of separating the creation of the buffer from its; use. Let us look how a buffer is written to a file. The dictionary for a; class needs to be loaded before any object of that type can be saved. The `TObject::Write` method does the following:. - Creates a **`TKey`** object in the current directory. - Creates a **`TBuffer`** object which is part of the newly created; **`TKey`**. - Fills the **`TBuffer`** with a call to the `class::Streamer` method. - Creates a second buffer for compression, if needed. - Reserves space by scanning the **`TFree`** list. At this point, the; size of the buffer is known. - Writes the buffer to the file. - Releases the **`TBuffer`** part of the key. In other words, the `TObject::Write` calls the `Streamer` method of the; class to build the buffer. The buffer is in the key and the key is; written to disk. Once written to disk the memory consumed by the buffer; part is released. The key part of the **`TKey`** is kept. ![A diagram of a streamed TH1F in the buffer](pictures/020000EB.jpg). The key consumes about 60 bytes, whereas the buffer, since it contains; the object data, can be very large. ### Ignore Object Streamers. Your class can ignore the **`TObject`** `Streamer `with the; `MyClass->Class::IgnoreObjectStreamer()` method. When the class; `kIgnoreTObjectStreamer `bit is set (by calling the; `IgnoreTObjectStreamer `method`)`, the automatically generated; `Streamer `will not call `TObject::Streamer`, and the **`TObject`** part; of the class is not streamed to the file. This is useful in case you do; not use the **`TObject`** `fBits` and `fUniqueID `data members. You gain; space on the file, and you do not loose functionality if you do not use; the `fBits` and `fUniqueID. `See ""The Role of TObject"" on the use of; `fBits` and `fUniqueID`. ### Streaming a TClonesArray.

Note in particular that it; covers the rules for pointer *values* (patterns of bits indicating the location; of a pointed-to object), not pointer *objects* (locations in memory which store; pointer values). The rules for objects are covered in the next section. A :arc-term:`retainable object pointer` (or ""retainable pointer"") is a value of; a :arc-term:`retainable object pointer type` (""retainable type""). There are; three kinds of retainable object pointer types:. * block pointers (formed by applying the caret (``^``) declarator sigil to a; function type); * Objective-C object pointers (``id``, ``Class``, ``NSFoo*``, etc.); * typedefs marked with ``__attribute__((NSObject))``. Other pointer types, such as ``int*`` and ``CFStringRef``, are not subject to; ARC's semantics and restrictions. .. admonition:: Rationale. We are not at liberty to require all code to be recompiled with ARC;; therefore, ARC must interoperate with Objective-C code which manages retains; and releases manually. In general, there are three requirements in order for; a compiler-supported reference-count system to provide reliable; interoperation:. * The type system must reliably identify which objects are to be managed. An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a conv",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:10714,release,releases,10714,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['release'],['releases']
Deployability,"t specific; points during the execution of a program. These operations make up a; non-contiguous subsequence of the computation history of the program.; The portion of this sequence for a particular retainable object; pointer for which a specific function execution is directly; responsible is the :arc-term:`formal local retain history` of the; object pointer. The corresponding actual sequence executed is the; `dynamic local retain history`. However, under certain circumstances, ARC is permitted to re-order and; eliminate operations in a manner which may alter the overall; computation history beyond what is permitted by the general ""as if""; rule of C/C++ and the :ref:`restrictions <arc.objects.retains>` on; the implementation of ``retain`` and ``release``. .. admonition:: Rationale. Specifically, ARC is sometimes permitted to optimize ``release``; operations in ways which might cause an object to be deallocated; before it would otherwise be. Without this, it would be almost; impossible to eliminate any ``retain``/``release`` pairs. For; example, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: objc. id x = _ivar;; [x foo];. If we were not permitted in any event to shorten the lifetime of the; object in ``x``, then we would not be able to eliminate this retain; and release unless we could prove that the message send could not; modify ``_ivar`` (or deallocate ``self``). Since message sends are; opaque to the optimizer, this is not possible, and so ARC's hands; would be almost completely tied. ARC makes no guarantees about the execution of a computation history; which contains undefined behavior. In particular, ARC makes no; guarantees in the presence of race conditions. ARC may assume that any retainable object pointers it receives or; generates are instantaneously valid from that point until a point; which, by the concurrency model of the host language, happens-after; the generation of the pointer and happens-before a release of that; object (possibly via an aliasing poi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:76835,release,release,76835,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['release'],['release']

See [ROOT-11009](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-11009) for further discussion.; - For some `TTrees`, `RDataFrame::GetColumnNames` might now returns multiple valid spellings for a given column. For example, leaf `""l""` under branch `""b""` might now be mentioned as `""l""` as well as `""b.l""`, while only one of the two spellings might have been recognized before.; - Certain RDF-related types in the `ROOT::Detail` and `ROOT::Internal` namespaces have been renamed, most notably `RCustomColumn` is now `RDefine`. This does not impact code that only makes use of entities in the public ROOT namespace, and should not impact downstream code unless it was patching or reusing internal `RDataFrame` types. ### Notable bug fixes and improvements. - A critical issue has been fixed that could potentially result in wrong data being silently read in multi-thread runs when an input `TChain` contained more than one `TTree` coming from the _same_ input file.

Deployability,"t, given a number of other; changes and restrictions in ARC, is to provide a specialized tool to assist; users in that migration. Implementing these methods was banned because they are too integral to the; semantics of ARC; many tricks which worked tolerably under manual reference; counting will misbehave if ARC performs an ephemeral extra retain or two. If; absolutely required, it is still possible to implement them in non-ARC code,; for example in a category; the implementations must obey the :ref:`semantics; <arc.objects.retains>` laid out elsewhere in this document. .. _arc.misc.special_methods.dealloc:. ``dealloc``; ^^^^^^^^^^^. A program is ill-formed if it contains a message send or ``@selector``; expression for the selector ``dealloc``. .. admonition:: Rationale. There are no legitimate reasons to call ``dealloc`` directly. A class may provide a method definition for an instance method named; ``dealloc``. This method will be called after the final ``release`` of the; object but before it is deallocated or any of its instance variables are; destroyed. The superclass's implementation of ``dealloc`` will be called; automatically when the method returns. .. admonition:: Rationale. Even though ARC destroys instance variables automatically, there are still; legitimate reasons to write a ``dealloc`` method, such as freeing; non-retainable resources. Failing to call ``[super dealloc]`` in such a; method is nearly always a bug. Sometimes, the object is simply trying to; prevent itself from being destroyed, but ``dealloc`` is really far too late; for the object to be raising such objections. Somewhat more legitimately, an; object may have been pool-allocated and should not be deallocated with; ``free``; for now, this can only be supported with a ``dealloc``; implementation outside of ARC. Such an implementation must be very careful; to do all the other work that ``NSObject``'s ``dealloc`` would, which is; outside the scope of this document to describe.
