Given two protein sets 'A' and 'B', MMseqs2 can search in two directions and report pairs ('a','b'), such that 'b' is the highest scoring hit of 'a' and 'a' is the highest scoring hit of 'b':; mmseqs createdb Aproteins.fasta Adb; mmseqs createdb Bproteins.fasta Bdb; mmseqs rbh Adb Bdb ABrbh tmp. To obtain the results in m8 format:; mmseqs convertalis Adb Bdb ABrbh ABrbh.m8. Behind the scenes; The workflow searches with each 'a' against the targets in 'B'. It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility.

Availability," As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?.

Reciprocal best hit using mmseqs rbh. Given two protein sets 'A' and 'B', MMseqs2 can search in two directions and report pairs ('a','b'), such that 'b' is the highest scoring hit of 'a' and 'a' is the highest scoring hit of 'b':; mmseqs easy-rbh Aproteins.fasta Bproteins.fasta ABrbh tmp. Behind the scenes; The workflow searches with each 'a' against the targets in 'B'. It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of core modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility.

Runtimes will slightly increase in this case.; You can calculate the memory requirements in bytes for L columns and N rows using the following formula:; M = (7 × N × L) byte + (8 × a^k) byte. MMseqs2 stores an index table and two auxiliary arrays, which have a total size of M byte.; For a database containing N sequences with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index table is (7 × N × L) byte .; Note that the memory consumption grows linearly with the number of the sequences N in the database.; The two auxiliary arrays consume (8 × a^k) byte, with a being the size of the amino acid alphabet (usually 20, the unknown amino acid X is excluded) and the k-mer size k.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI; MMseqs2 can run on m",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html:11111,avail,available,11111,Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html,4,['avail'],['available']

Availability," a human gut metagenomics dataset; Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome; We use Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from; the reads, without the nucleic assembly step. It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. Alternatively, the reads can be downloaded directly from the European Nucleotide Archives's download server:; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_1.fastq.gz; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_2.fastq.gz. The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly. Then extract proteins using Prodigal in metagenomics mode:; prodigal -i megahit_assembly/final.contigs.fa -a prodigal_proteins.fasta -p meta. Take a look at the FASTA files produced by Plass and Prodigal. To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa. Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members.

Availability," arguments the command might need, and options can be given to change parameter settings or modify the behaviour of the command in some way.; You can get information about any mmseqs command by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs search. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the command. For example ""mmseqs search"" will give you its usage as; Usage: <i:queryDB> <i:targetDB> <o:alignmentDB> <tmpDir> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, and [...] indicate optional arguments.; Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster.

For clustering, MMseqs2 easy-cluster and easy-linclust are available.; easy-cluster by default clusters the entries of a FASTA/FASTQ file using a cascaded clustering algorithm.; mmseqs easy-cluster examples/DB.fasta clusterRes tmp . easy-linclust clusters the entries of a FASTA/FASTQ file. The runtime scales linearly with input size. This mode is recommended for huge datasets.; mmseqs easy-linclust examples/DB.fasta clusterRes tmp . These easy workflows are a shorthand to deal directly with FASTA/FASTQ files as input and output. MMseqs2 provides many modules to transform, filter, execute external programs and search. However, these modules use the MMseqs2 database formats, instead of the FASTA/FASTQ format. For optimal efficiency, we recommend to use MMseqs2 workflows and modules directly.; Search; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB.

The offsetalignment module will offset the alignment position to the orf start position + alignment start * 3.; Mapping Very Similar Sequences using mmseqs map. The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database. First it calls the prefilter module (with a low sensitivity setting) to detect high scoring diagonals and then computes an ungapped alignment with the rescorediagonal module. In contrast to the normal search, for maximum speed no gapped alignment is computed, query sequences are not masked for low complexity regions and no compositional bias correction is applied.; $ mmseqs map queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. MMseqs2 will provide a sorted (by E-value) list of best matches in resultDB. The best hit can be extracted with:; $ mmseqs filterdb resultDB bestResultDB --extract-lines 1. The format of resultDB is the same as in alignment format of the normal search workflow. The mapping workflow can also be used in iterative-best-hit mode, where each query that does not find any match is searched with higher sensitivity again.; If either queryDB or targetDB is a nucleotide sequence database, MMseqs2 will use the translated sequence search mode described above.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster or mmseqs linclust.

You can, for example, do a translated nucleotide against protein profile search.; How to cluster; Before clustering, convert your database into the MMseqs2 database format:; mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta DB. Then execute the clustering:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp. Please ensure that in case of large input databases the temporary direcotry provides enough free space.; For disk space requirements, see the user guide.; To generate a FASTA-style formatted output file from the ffindex output file, type:; mmseqs createseqfiledb DB clu clu_seq ; mmseqs result2flat DB DB clu_seq clu_seq.fasta. To generate a TSV-style formatted output file from the ffindex output file, type:; mmseqs createtsv DB DB clu clu.tsv. To extract the representative sequences from the clustering result call:; mmseqs result2repseq DB clu DB_clu_rep; mmseqs result2flat DB DB DB_clu_rep DB_clu_rep.fasta --use-fasta-header. Read more about the format here.; Documentation; The MMseqs2 user guide is available in our GitHub Wiki or as a PDF file (Thanks to pandoc!). We provide a tutorial of MMseqs2 here.; Memory Requirements; When using MMseqs2 the available memory limits the size of database you will be able to compute in one go.; We recommend at least 128 GB of RAM so you can compute databases up to 30.000.000 entries.; MMseqs2 will automatically subdivide the target database if less memory is available. Runtimes will slightly increase in this case.; You can calculate the memory requirements in bytes for L columns and N rows using the following formula:; M = (7 × N × L) byte + (8 × a^k) byte. MMseqs2 stores an index table and two auxiliary arrays, which have a total size of M byte.; For a database containing N sequences with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index table is (7 × N × L) byte .; Note that the memory consumption grows linearly with the number of the sequences N in the database.; The two auxiliary arrays consume (8 × a^k) byte, with a being the size of the amino ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html:10960,avail,available,10960,Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html,4,['avail'],['available']

Availability," fast; It is crucial for single (or small) query sets that the target database is already in memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs each search. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches them.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp ; mmseqs touch targetDB.idxdb; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB.idxdb aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The tool mmseqs touch fetches the database into memory and the --db-load-mode 2 is an optimized way to read the database if the database is already fetched into memory.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology. Therefore we turned of compositional bias correction, we do not mask the database, search with low sensitivity -s 2 and we align only ungapped.; Workflow Control Parameters; Search Workflow; Compares all sequences in the query database with all sequences in the; target database.; Usage:; mmseqs search <queryDB> <targetDB> <outDB> <tmpDir> [opts]; Options:; -s [float] Target sensitivity in the range [1:8.5] (default=4).; Adjusts the sensitivity of the prefiltering and influences the; prefiltering run time.; 1.0 fastest - 8.5 sensitive. The sensitivity between 8 to 8.5 should be as sensitive as BLAST.; For detailed explanation see section; Computation of Prefiltering Scores using mmseqs prefilter.; Clustering Workflow; Calculates the clustering of the sequences in the input database.; Usage:; mmseqs cluster <sequenceDB> <outDB> <tmpDir> [opts]; Options:; --single-step-clustering Starts the single-step instead of the cascaded clustering workflow.; The database can be clustered in a single step instead of with a cascaded workflow.; This increases runtime and ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/131636404f035df7c655b539b35c185dec3f157d.html:93374,mask,mask,93374,Home/131636404f035df7c655b539b35c185dec3f157d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/131636404f035df7c655b539b35c185dec3f157d.html,1,['mask'],['mask']

Customizing compilation through CMake; Compiling MMseqs2 from source results in binaries that are optimized for the system on which MMseqs2 was compiled. Using these binaries on another system may lead to errors (e.g., Invalid instruction) or degraded performance. You can customize the compilation process by specifying the appropriate flags during the cmake call for your system. The following flags are available:. -DHAVE_AVX2=1: for AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for AVX2 instructions. -DHAVE_SSE4_1=1: for AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for SSE4.1 instructions. -DHAVE_SSE2=1: for old AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for SSE2 instructions. -DHAVE_POWER9=1: for PPC64LE systems with support for POWER9 AltiVec instructions. -DHAVE_POWER8=1: for PPC64LE systems with support for POWER8 AltiVec instructions. -DHAVE_ARM8=1: for ARM64 systems with support for NEON instructions. You can also disable the automatic setup of architecture-specific compilation flags with -DNATIVE_ARCH=0. Use -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS and -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to set the flags for your system. This is useful in combination with the -mtune/-march/-mcpu flags of GCC/Clang if you know exactly what system your binary will later run on.; To disable the use of the ips4o sorting library, which requires atomic compare exchange instructions for 16-byte/128-bit values, you can use -DDISABLE_IPS4O=1.

Runtimes will slightly increase in this case.; You can calculate the memory requirements in bytes for L columns and N rows using the following formula:; M = (7 × N × L) byte + (8 × a^k) byte. MMseqs2 stores an index table and two auxiliary arrays, which have a total size of M byte.; For a database containing N sequences with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index table is (7 × N × L) byte .; Note that the memory consumption grows linearly with the number of the sequences N in the database.; The two auxiliary arrays consume (8 × a^k) byte, with a being the size of the amino acid alphabet (usually 20, the unknown amino acid X is excluded) and the k-mer size k.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI; MMseqs2 can run on multiple cores and servers using OpenMP and Message Passing Interface (MPI).; MPI assigns database splits to each compute node and each node computes them using multiple cores (OpenMP).; Most of the re",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/b6f19180d69aa063e9ccebbbe814ac17becf4349.html:11510,avail,available,11510,Home/b6f19180d69aa063e9ccebbbe814ac17becf4349.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/b6f19180d69aa063e9ccebbbe814ac17becf4349.html,1,['avail'],['available']

It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of Core Modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility.

In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. Regions satisfying one of the following criteria are masked out: (1) all 6-mers are under a bit score of 8.75 after amino acid local composition bias correction, (2) four consecutive identical residues, (3) four consecutive 2-mers with at most one mismatch between them, (4) four consecutive 3-mers at most two mismatches.

The index file contains; in each line, separated by tabs, (1) the key, (2) the offset in bytes; of the data_record counted from the start of the data file, and (3); the size of the data record.

Availability," set cover works by iteratively selecting the node with most connections and all its connected nodes to form a cluster and repeating until all nodes are in a cluster.; The greedy set cover is followed by a reassignment step. A Cluster member is assigned to another cluster centroid if their alignment score was higher.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologs. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size. Linear-time clustering algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 find exact k-mer matches between the N input sequences that are extended in step 3 and 4.; (1) Linclust selects in each sequence the m (default: 20) k-mers with the lowest hash function values, as this tends to select the same k-mers across homologous sequences. It uses a reduced alphabet of 13 letters for the k-mers and sets k=10 for sequence identity thresholds below 90% and k=14 above. It generates a table in which each of the mN lines consists of the $k$-mer, the sequence identifier, and the position of the $k$-mer in the sequence.; (2) Linclust sorts the table by $k$-mer in quasi-linear time, which identifies groups of sequences sharing the same k-mer (large shaded boxes). For each k-mer group, it selects the longest sequence as centre.

It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly. Then extract proteins using Prodigal in metagenomics mode:; prodigal -i megahit_assembly/final.contigs.fa -a prodigal_proteins.fasta -p meta.

Frequently Asked Questions; This section describes common questions.; How to set the right alignment coverage to cluster; MMseqs2 has three modes to control the sequence length overlap ""coverage"": --cov-mode (0) bidirectional, (1) target coverage, (2) query coverage and (3) target-in-query length coverage. In the context of cluster or linclust, the query is seen representative sequence and target is a member sequence. The --cov-mode flag also automatically sets the --cluster-mode.

Availability," the taxonomy database).; As detailed in the following sections, there are several ways to create and manipulate a seqTaxDB. Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; The databases module provides a easy way to download and setup taxonomy; databases that we predefined (see Downloading databases). Follow this section to learn how to manually create a seqTaxDB.; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot idmapping and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier. By default, createtaxdb downloads the Uniprot id mapping file (idmapping.dat.gz), and thus only supports Uniprot identifiers.; If your seqTaxDB does not contain Uniprot ids or you wish to provide an alternative source for the taxonomic information, please follow the instructions here:. To create a seqTaxDB from an existing NCBI BLAST database (such as nr or nt), see the section Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database.; For the SILVA database use mmseqs databases or see Create a seqTaxDB for SILVA for an example how to build it yourself.; For the GTDB database see Create a seqTaxDB for GTDB.; For other database types, the mapping must be created manually, as described in section Create a seqTaxDB by manual annotation of a sequence database. Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels.

Availability," up the Bash/Zsh command completion; MMseqs2 comes with a Bash command and parameter auto completion feature, which makes it easy to navigate and execute MMseqs2 modules, workflows and parameters by providing a list of available parameters or completing partially typed module/workflow names. To enable this feature, add the following lines to your $HOME/.bashrc:; if [ -f /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh ]; then; source /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh; fi. The Bash completion can also be used with Zsh by loading the bashcompinit compatibility shim first.

Customizing compilation through CMake; Compiling MMseqs2 from source results in binaries that are optimized for the system on which MMseqs2 was compiled. Using these binaries on another system may lead to errors (e.g., Invalid instruction) or degraded performance. You can customize the compilation process by specifying the appropriate flags during the cmake call for your system.

MMseqs databases hide these files from; the file system by storing them in a single data file. The data file <name>; contains the data records, i.e. the contents of the file, concatenated and separated; by \0 characters. A second, index file <name>.index contains for; each numerical identifies (corresponding to the file name); the position of the corresponding data record in the data file.; The MMseqs2 modules createdb and createfasta do the format; conversion from fasta to the MMseqs database format. createdb; generates an MMseqs database from a FASTA sequence database. It assigns; each sequence in the FASTA file sequentially a numerical id. Sequences; that are longer than 32768 letters are split. createfasta converts an; MMseqs database to a FASTA formatted text file: the sequence headers contain the; DB identifiers preceded by >, and the sequence is extracted ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/2ea004b57eebb3cca084348f3cf07019c65c47f5.html:13619,down,down,13619,Home/2ea004b57eebb3cca084348f3cf07019c65c47f5.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/2ea004b57eebb3cca084348f3cf07019c65c47f5.html,3,['down'],['down']

It retains for each 'a' the maximal bitscore it got with any of its hits (denoted 'x'). It then searches with each 'b' against targets in A and retains its best scoring hit(s). If among these, 'a' is found with the score 'x', the pair ('a','b') will be reported as an RBH pair.; Importantly, no correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed during the searches (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction.; Finally, please note that E-values are not used to determine pairing but they are used as a cutoff for the searches (rbh uses the default value of -e and this can be changed, if needed).; Description of core modules; For advanced users, it is possible to skip the workflows and execute the; core modules for maximum flexibility. Especially for the sequence search; it can be useful to adjust the prefiltering and alignment parameters; according to the needs of the user.; MMseqs2 contains three core modules: prefiltering, alignment and; clustering.; Computation of prefiltering scores using mmseqs prefilter. The prefiltering module computes an ungapped alignment score for all; consecutive k-mer matches between all query sequences and all database; sequences and returns the highest score per sequence.; If you want to cluster a database, or do an all-against-all search,; the same dat",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f609e94f63ca8f66eec2253953cd938781cd359b.html:57130,mask,masking,57130,Home/f609e94f63ca8f66eec2253953cd938781cd359b.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f609e94f63ca8f66eec2253953cd938781cd359b.html,34,['mask'],"['mask', 'masking']"
Availability,"%.; Filtering taxonomy output; Other MMseqs2 modules work with taxonomyResult databases e.g. filtertaxdb can be used to extract taxa, addtaxonomy to augment a result database with taxonomic information.; Here is an example for using filtertaxdb to extract only results whose taxonomic assignment is any kind of virus (i.e., in the superkingdom ""viruses"").; mmseqs filtertaxdb seqTaxDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult.virus --taxon-list 10239; awk '$3 != 1 {print}' taxonomyResult.virus > taxonomyResult.virus.id; mmseqs createsubdb taxonomyResult.virus.id queryDB queryDB.virus; mmseqs createsubdb taxonomyResult.virus.id queryDB_h queryDB.virus_h. Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database; It is easy to create a seqTaxDB from a pre-existing local BLAST databases, if BLAST+ is installed. The following example creates an MMSeqs2 database from NCBI's nt database, but it also works with any of the other BLAST databases including the nr protein database.; First, manually download the NCBI taxonomy database dump:; wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz; mkdir taxonomy && tar -xxvf taxdump.tar.gz -C taxonomy. BLAST+'s blastdbcmd can be used to extract both the FASTA as well as the taxonomy mapping files:; blastdbcmd -db nt -entry all > nt.fna; blastdbcmd -db nt -entry all -outfmt ""%a %T"" > nt.fna.taxidmapping. Finally, the createdb and createtaxdb modules use the information to create a complete MMSeqs2 database:; mmseqs createdb nt.fna nt.fnaDB; mmseqs createtaxdb nt.fnaDB tmp --ncbi-tax-dump taxonomy/ --tax-mapping-file nt.fna.taxidmapping. Create a seqTaxDB for SILVA; If you want to classify ribosomal RNA (16S, 18S, SSU) sequences against the SILVA database you can download it through the databases workflow:; mmseqs databases SILVA silvadb tmp.

Test data (a query and a target database for the sequence; search and a database for the clustering) are stored in the examples; folder.; Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster. The easy-search searches directly with a FASTA/FASTQ file against a either another FASTA/FASTQ file or an already existing MMseqs2 target database.; mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs easy-search examples/QUERY.fasta targetDB alnRes tmp . For clustering, MMseqs2 easy-cluster and easy-linclust are available.; easy-cluster by default clusters the entries of a FASTA/FASTQ file using a cascaded clustering algorithm.; mmseqs easy-cluster examples/DB.fasta clusterRes tmp . easy-linclust clusters the entries of a FASTA/FASTQ file. The runtime scales linearly with input size. This mode is recommended for huge datasets.; mmseqs easy-linclust examples/DB.fasta clusterRes tmp . These easy workflows are a shorthand to deal directly with FASTA/FASTQ files as input and output. MMseqs2 provides many modules to transform, filter, execute external programs and search. However, these modules use the MMseqs2 database formats, instead of the FASTA/FASTQ format. For optimal efficiency, we recommend to use MMseqs2 workflows and modules directly.; Search; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB. You can use the query; database examples/QUERY.fasta and target database examples/DB.fasta; to test t",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ed067a1f7d194d6a612eb5e1aaf24ac7bc00c53.html:15115,avail,available,15115,Home/1ed067a1f7d194d6a612eb5e1aaf24ac7bc00c53.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ed067a1f7d194d6a612eb5e1aaf24ac7bc00c53.html,23,['avail'],['available']

Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are shell scripts chaining elementary MMseqs2 module and other workflows together. A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h.

The score per residue equivalent to a certain sequence identity is obtained by a linear regression using thousands of local alignments as training set.; Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clustering’s down to 50% sequence identity in very short time. To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity.

Alignment and prefiltering modules are using with SSE4.1 and; OpenMP, i.e. MMseqs2 can take advantage of multicore computers.; MMseqs2 needs uses a lot main memory (see section memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (≈500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Database Format; MMseqs2 works internally with a database format similar to the ffindex; databases. The format was developed to avoid drastically slowing down; the file system when millions of files need to be written and accessed.; ffindex hides the single files from the file system by storing them as; unstructured data records in a single huge binary data file. In; addition to this data file, an ffindex database includes a secondary; file: This index file stores for each entry as tab separated line with; an unique accession code, the start position in bytes of the data record; in the ffindex data file, and a record length.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12. The index contains four entries 10, 11, 12 and 13. The; entries have the offset position 0, 10, 25, 35 and the entry size 10,; 15, 10, 12 respectively.

Availability,"_taxonomy a binary version of the former files (created by createtaxdb which reduces the read-in time of the taxonomy database).; As detailed in the following sections, there are several ways to create and manipulate a seqTaxDB. Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; The databases module provides a easy way to download and setup taxonomy; databases that we predefined (see Downloading databases). Follow this section to learn how to manually create a seqTaxDB.; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot idmapping and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier. By default, createtaxdb downloads the Uniprot id mapping file (idmapping.dat.gz), and thus only supports Uniprot identifiers.; If your seqTaxDB does not contain Uniprot ids or you wish to provide an alternative source for the taxonomic information, please follow the instructions here:. To create a seqTaxDB from an existing NCBI BLAST database (such as nr or nt), see the section Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database.; For the SILVA database use mmseqs databases or see Create a seqTaxDB for SILVA for an example how to build it yourself.; For the GTDB database see Create a seqTaxDB for GTDB.; For other database types, the mapping must be created manually, as described in section Create a seqTaxDB by manual annotation of a sequence database.

Customizing compilation through CMake; Compiling MMseqs2 from source results in binaries that are optimized for the system on which MMseqs2 was compiled. Using these binaries on another system may lead to errors (e.g., Invalid instruction) or degraded performance. You can customize the compilation process by specifying the appropriate flags during the cmake call for your system. The following flags are available:. -DHAVE_AVX2=1: for AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for AVX2 instructions. -DHAVE_SSE4_1=1: for AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for SSE4.1 instructions. -DHAVE_SSE2=1: for old AMD/Intel x64 systems with support for SSE2 instructions. -DHAVE_POWER9=1: for PPC64LE systems with support for POWER9 AltiVec instructions. -DHAVE_POWER8=1: for PPC64LE systems with support for POWER8 AltiVec instructions. -DHAVE_ARM8=1: for ARM64 systems with support for NEON instructions. You can also disable the automatic setup of architecture-specific compilation flags with -DNATIVE_ARCH=0. Use -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS and -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to set the flags for your system. This is useful in combination with the -mtune/-march/-mcpu flags of GCC/Clang if you know exactly what system your binary will later run on.; To disable the use of the",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:19697,degraded,degraded,19697,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,7,['degraded'],['degraded']

Due to time and virtual machine constraints we chose a rather; small metagenomic dataset, but using MMseqs2 on bigger datasets should; convince you of its scalability.; References; Eddy, Sean R. 2009.

Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. Regions satisfying one of the following criteria are masked out: (1) all 6-mers are under a bit score of 8.75 after amino acid local composition bias correction, (2) four consecutive identical residues, (3) four consecutive 2-mers with at most one mismatch between them, (4) four consecutive 3-mers at most two mismatches. Using GPLv2-licensed code from pfilt (""Getting the most from PSI–BLAST"", DT Jones, 2002) and default parameters, we also mask (5) coiled coils and (6) all windows of size 12 that contain only three distinct amino acids.

Create a profile database in MMseqs2 format.; To turn an MSA into a sequence profile, mmseqs2 needs to decide for each column whether it will be represented by a column in the sequence profile or not. The sensitivity of searches with the sequence profiles can depend critically on which columns are represented. By default, mmseqs2 uses the setting; --match-mode 0 (profile column assignment by first sequence in MSA),; which means match states are assigned by the first (master) sequence in the MSA: All columns where this master sequence has a residue will be turned into profile columns, all others will be ignored and the residues in them will be modeled as insertions relative to the sequence profile.; This is risky for large Pfam MSAs in which the first sequenc",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f3a08292701b13a140b600565063b44fdced99c6.html:93305,Down,Download,93305,Home/f3a08292701b13a140b600565063b44fdced99c6.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f3a08292701b13a140b600565063b44fdced99c6.html,25,['Down'],['Download']

Availability,"art of its computation, MMseqs2 writes temporary files corresponding to each of the database splits. The number of the database splits is determined by the number of servers and number of cores in each server. By default, temporary files are written to the shared disk.; In case the number of database splits is large, it would mean a high burden of I/O operations on the same disk. To avoid slowdowns due to this issue, an additional parameter can be passed to search in MPI mode:; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp --local-tmp /local/hdd/. Passing this parameter will write the temporary files of each server (created by its cores) on the indicated path (local disk) and reduce the number of temporary files handled on the shared disk.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using batch systems; MMseqs2 comes with tools to split database to distribute jobs in batch systems (like qsub, slurm, moab, lsf, ...).; However, the MPI solution is preferred if available since it optimizes the distribution of computing load.; Splitting the query database can be used to distribute the load, MMseqs2 has a module called splitdb that splits the database in --split N chunks.

Sequences which are not similar enough; to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; Taxonomy assignment using mmseqs taxonomy. By identifying homologs through searches with reference databases with taxonomy annotations, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor of these homologs. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol with --lca-mode 2 (default) for chosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be then only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the one from blast2lca.

How is MMseqs handling low complexity; MMseqs uses reduces low complexity effects on the query and target database.; Query sequences are handled by an amino acid local compositional bias correction. In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. Regions satisfying one of the following criteria are masked out: (1) all 6-mers are under a bit score of 8.75 after amino acid local composition bias correction, (2) four consecutive identical residues, (3) four consecutive 2-mers with at most one mismatch between them, (4) four consecutive 3-mers at most two mismatches. Using GPLv2-licensed code from pfilt (""Getting the most from PSI–BLAST"", DT Jones, 2002) and default parameters, we also mask (5) coiled coils and (6) all windows of size 12 that contain only three distinct amino acids.

Currently 0.235 for normal sequence searches and 0.331 for profile searches.; You can also use our Docker images to run this benchmark:; cd mmseqs-folder; docker build -t mmseqs2 .; git clone https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark.git; cd mmseqs-benchmark; docker build -t mmseqs-benchmark . The regression test passed, if the second image exits cleanly.; Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan ... Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers.

A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h.

In prefilter and alignment stages we apply a correction to substitution matrix scores assigning lower scores to the matches of amino acids that are overrepresented in the local sequence neighborhood. To switch the compositional bias correction on and off use --comp-bias-corr.; Target sequences low-complexity regions are masked during the prefilter stage. Regions satisfying one of the following criteria are masked out: (1) all 6-mers are under a bit score of 8.75 after amino acid local composition bias correction, (2) four consecutive identical residues, (3) four consecutive 2-mers with at most one mismatch between them, (4) four consecutive 3-mers at most two mismatches. Using GPLv2-licensed code from pfilt (""Getting the most from PSI–BLAST"", DT Jones, 2002) and default parameters, we also mask (5) coiled coils and (6) all windows of size 12 that contain only three distinct amino acids.

The --cov-mode flag also automatically sets the --cluster-mode.; (1) With --cov-mode 0 -c [0.0,1.0] only sequences are clustered that have a sequence length overlap greater than X% of the longer of the two sequences. This coverage mode should be used to cluster full length protein sequences.

Availability,"e touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

By identifying homologs through searches with taxonomy annotated reference databases, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 (default) for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1.

Building the Docker container; The Dockerfile used to build the MMseqs2 Docker container requires docker buildx, which should be installed with a regular Docker installation (version 19.03 or higher). To build the Docker container from the Git repository, follow these steps:; git clone https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2.git; cd MMseqs2; docker buildx build -t mmseqs2 . This will create a new Docker image with the tag mmseqs2 that you can use to run MMseqs2 in a containerized environment. Set up the Bash/Zsh command completion; MMseqs2 comes with a Bash command and parameter auto completion feature, which makes it easy to navigate and execute MMseqs2 modules, workflows and parameters by providing a list of available parameters or completing partially typed module/workflow names. To enable this feature, add the following lines to your $HOME/.bashrc:; if [ -f /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh ]; then; source /Path to MMseqs2/util/bash-completion.sh; fi.

MMseqs2: ultra fast and sensitive protein search and clustering suite; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software suite to search and cluster huge proteins/nucleotide sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for Linux, MacOS, and (as beta version, via cygwin) Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability. MMseqs2 can run 10000 times faster than BLAST. At 100 times its speed it achieves almost the same sensitivity. It can perform profile searches with the same sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.; The MMseqs2 user guide is available in our GitHub Wiki or as a PDF file (Thanks to pandoc!); Please cite:; Steinegger M and Soeding J.

Inside you will find the mmseqs.bat wrapper script, which should be used to substitute all calls to mmseqs in the remainder of this document, and a bin folder with all dependencies of the MMseqs2 Windows version. Please always keep the mmseqs.bat script one folder above the bin folder, or it will not be able to correctly identify its dependencies anymore.; The windows build also contains both the SSE4.1 and the AVX2 version. The mmseqs.bat script will automatically choose the correct one.; Compile from source under Windows; The windows build process is more involved due to MMseqs2's dependency on an installed shell.

This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 (default) for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through an dynamic programming approach.; Prerequisites; The taxonomy workflow requires the NCBI taxonomy taxdump.tar.gz. It is available on the NCBI FTP server:; mkdir ncbi-taxdump && cd ncbi-taxdump; wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz; tar xzvf taxdump.tar.gz; cd .. Provide the path to the extraction location in the mmseqs taxonomy call as the <i:NcbiTaxdmpDir> parameter.; The workflow further requires a tab-separated mapping <i:targetTaxonMapping> with every target database identifier mapped to a NCBI taxon identifier.

Such a database includes the following files:; seqTaxDB, seqTaxDB.index, seqTaxDB.dbtype, seqTaxDB.lookup, seqTaxDB_h, seqTaxDB_h.index, seqTaxDB_h.dbtype, seqTaxDB_mapping and either the taxonomy flat file databases seqTaxDB_nodes.dmp, seqTaxDB_names.dmp, seqTaxDB_merged.dmp or seqTaxDB_taxonomy a binary version of the former files (created by createtaxdb which reduces the read-in time of the taxonomy database).; As detailed in the following sections, there are several ways to create and manipulate a seqTaxDB. Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; The databases module provides a easy way to download and setup taxonomy; databases that we predefined (see Downloading databases). Follow this section to learn how to manually create a seqTaxDB.; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot idmapping and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier. By default, createtaxdb downloads the Uniprot id mapping file (idmapping.dat.gz), and thus only supports Uniprot identifiers.; If your seqTaxDB does not contain Uniprot ids or you wish to provide an alternative source for the taxonomic information, please follow the instructions here:.

Then, you can run; the clustering with the following command:; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp. Increasing the k-mers selected per sequence increases the sensitivity of linclust at a moderate loss of speed.; Use the paramter --kmer-per-seq to increase the number of k-mers selected per sequence.

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

Availability,"he touchdb module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole precomputed index into memory. This saves, for a large database, minutes of copying from the storage system into RAM. However, this is less efficient for large query sets.; The reason for this is that copying the index into memory will use transparent huge pages (on operating systems that support THP), which in turn results in less TLB cache misses during the prefiltering stage. For a large query set the use of THP results in 15-20% speed improvement of the prefiltering stage.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of a technical task rather than measuring homology. Therefore we turned off compositional bias correction, we do not mask the database, search with low sensitivity -s 2 and we align only ungapped.; How to build your own MMseqs2 compatible substitution matrices; You can use the (still Work in Progress) R script in util/format_substitution_matrix.R to prepare a substitution matrix for use in MMseqs2. It takes a matrix from stdin and returns the reformatted matrix to stdout.; util/format_substitution_matrix.R < data/MATRIX.mat > data/MATRIX.out; mmseqs search query db res tmp --sub-mat data/MATRIX.out.

Availability,"ilter or align can take advantage of MPI to speed up the computation.; To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk against the entire target set. Splitting the target database is less time-efficient due to the slow, IO-limited merging of results. But it reduces the memory required on each server to (7 × N L/#chunks) byte + (a^k × 8) byte and allows users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory sizes. If the number of chunks is larger than the number of servers, chunks will be distributed among servers and processed sequentially. By default, MMseqs2 automatically decides which mode to pick based on the available memory (assume that all machines have the same amount of memory).; Make sure that MMseqs2 was compiled with MPI by using the -DHAVE_MPI=1 flag (cmake -DHAVE_MPI=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..). Our precompiled static version of MMseqs2 can not use MPI.; To search with multiple server call the search workflow with the MPI command exported in the RUNNER environment variable. The databases and temporary folder have to be shared between all nodes (e.g. through NFS):; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. The same requirements apply to clustering or any of the other workflows:; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp. Add a custom footer; . . . Toggle table of contents; Pages 3. Loading.

Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules (detailed in YYY) to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot taxMappingFile and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier. By default, createtaxdb downloads the Uniprot id mapping file (idmapping.dat.gz), and thus only supports Uniprot identifiers.; If your seqTaxDB does not contain Uniprot ids or you wish to provide an alternative source for the taxonomic information, please follow the instructions here:. To create a seqTaxDB from an existing NCBI BLAST database (such as nr or nt), see the section Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database.; For the SILVA database see Create a seqTaxDB for SILVA.; For other database types, the mapping must be created manually, as described in section Create a seqTaxDB by manual annotation of a sequence database. Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'.

Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are shell scripts chaining elementary MMseqs2 module and other workflows together. A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h. Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster.

Availability,"is crucial for single (or small) query set searches that the target database residues in memory. If the target database is not in memory, MMseqs2 needs to fetch 100s of GBs for each query. The following workflow creates an index and fetches the database into memory and efficiently searches through it.; mmseqs createdb targetDB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createindex targetDB tmp ; mmseqs touch targetDB; mmseqs search queryDB targetDB aln tmp --db-load-mode 2. The touch module fetches the precomputed index database into memory and --db-load-mode 2 tells MMseqs2 to mmap the database instead of copying the whole structure into memory.; What is the difference between the map and search workflow; The map and search workflow both call the search workflow. The only difference are the default parameters and alignment strategy. map should used for high identities which is more of an technical task rather than measuring homology.

Sequences which are not similar enough; to any existing cluster will be representatives of new clusters.; Taxonomy assignment using mmseqs taxonomy. By identifying homologs through searches with taxonomy annotated reference databases, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 (default) for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through an dynamic programming approach.; Prerequisites; The taxonomy workflow requires the NCBI taxonomy taxdump.tar.gz.

Availability,"ment of sequences that pass a cut-off score in the prefiltering module. Both modules are parallelized to use all available computer cores, resulting in a highly efficient software suite. With its combination of sensitivity and speed, MMseqs2 can effectively search predicted ORFs in vast metagenomics datasets against the entire UniProtKB or NCBI-NR databases and assign functional clusters and taxonomic clades to reads that other software may be unable to map.; MMseqs2's clustering module is highly efficient at grouping similar sequences into clusters. It takes the similarity graph generated from the comparison of a sequence set with itself in the prefiltering or alignment modules as its input. Furthermore, MMseqs2 provides an updating workflow that allows for the addition of new sequences to an existing clustering while maintaining stable cluster identifiers, eliminating the need to recluster the entire sequence set. We use MMseqs2 to regularly update versions of the UniProtKB database, which have been clustered down to a 30% sequence similarity threshold. This database is accessible at uniclust.mmseqs.com.; System requirements; MMseqs2 is compatible with modern UNIX-based operating systems and has been thoroughly tested on Linux and macOS. While we do provide a version of MMseqs2 for Windows, we recommend that users utilize the Linux version through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for the best performance and stability.; MMseqs2 utilizes OpenMP to enable multi-core processing and takes advantage of the SIMD capabilities of the host system. For optimal performance, we recommend a system with the AVX2 instruction set, although MMseqs2 can also run on systems with SSE4.1 or even SSE2. Additionally, MMseqs2 is compatible with the PPC64LE and ARM64 processor architectures, which require support for the AltiVec and NEON SIMD instruction sets, respectively.; When searching large databases, MMseqs2 may require a significant amount of main memory (see section memory requir",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html:8571,down,down,8571,Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1ea9a93cb31d6c8cc25ef963311bcdddb95ff58d.html,8,['down'],['down']

It will start searching with the lowest sensitivity defined with --start-sens and search until the target sensitivity -s is reached.; The amount of steps to reach -s can be defined with --sens-steps.; Queries are only used again in the next iteration, if no match could be found that fulfilled the acceptance criteria in the previous iteration.; For example, the following search performs three search steps with sensitivity -s 1, 4 and 7.; mmseqs search qDB tDB rDB tmp --start-sens 1 --sens-steps 3 -s 7. Using this iterative approach can speed up best-hit-searches 4-10 times.; There is a chance that the best hit is not found but the chances are low. Prefilter hits found at a lower sensitivity threshold, have more highly conserved k-mers in common. This effect can be reduced if a higher start sensitivity is used",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/14fc9e9f337f1b4453ed0266efee347cdf56dc7d.html:90169,redundant,redundant,90169,Home/14fc9e9f337f1b4453ed0266efee347cdf56dc7d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/14fc9e9f337f1b4453ed0266efee347cdf56dc7d.html,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan ..

It retains for each 'a' its single best hit (if it has at least one) as a candidate. It then similarly searches and retains candidates in the other direction. No correction for composition bias nor low complexity masking is performed (--comp-bias-corr 0 and --mask 0) to assure the bitscores remain the same irrespective of the search direction. Next, the candidates are examined and if the pair ('a','b') is also found in the direction ('b','a') with the same bitscore - it is reported as an RBH-pair.; Of note, in case of equalities the pairing is not well-defined and currently rbh does not deal with them (reflected in taking a single candidate in each direction). This can result in the following edge cases:. 'a' has two equal top-scoring hits: 'b1' and 'b2' and each of them has 'a' as its best hit, rbh will report either ('a','b1') or ('a','b2') (but not both).; 'a' has two equal top-scoring hits: 'b1' and 'b2'. 'b1' has 'a' as its best hit but 'b2' doesn't (has a better hit). Since only one candidate is taken for 'a', it might be 'b2' and in this case, the pair ('a','b1') will not be reported.

For clustering, MMseqs2 easy-cluster and easy-linclust are available.; easy-cluster by default clusters the entries of a FASTA/FASTQ file using a cascaded clustering algorithm.; mmseqs easy-cluster examples/DB.fasta clusterRes tmp . easy-linclust clusters the entries of a FASTA/FASTQ file. The runtime scales linearly with input size. This mode is recommended for huge datasets.; mmseqs easy-linclust examples/DB.fasta clusterRes tmp . These easy workflows are a shorthand to deal directly with FASTA/FASTQ files as input and output. MMseqs2 provides many modules to transform, filter, execute external programs and search. However, these modules use the MMseqs2 database formats, instead of the FASTA/FASTQ format. For optimal efficiency, we recommend to use MMseqs2 workflows and modules directly.; Searching; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB.

MPI assigns database splits to each; servers and each server computes them using multiple cores (OMP).; Currently prefilter, align, result2profile, swapresults can take; advantage of MPI. To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and; gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different; modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence; set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all; queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is; split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk; against the entire target set. The number of chunks is controlled; through the --split parameter. Splitting the target database is less time-efficient due to the slow,; IO-limited merging of results, but it reduces the memory required on each server to:; ((7 * N * L) / #chunks + 21^k * 8) byte. Thus, it allows users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory; sizes.

Clustering uses the prefilter, alignment and clustering module.; The cascaded clustering sets all the options controlling the size of the; output, speed and memory consumption, internally adjusting parameters in; each cascaded clustering step.; Each workflow uses a different set of default parameters that can be changed.; How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI; MMseqs2 can run on multiple cores and servers using OpenMP and; message passing interface (MPI). MPI assigns database splits to each; server and each server computes them using multiple cores (OpenMP).; Currently prefilter, align, result2profile, swapresults can take; advantage of MPI. To parallelize the time-consuming k-mer matching and; gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different; modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence; set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all; queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is; split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk; against the entire target set. The number of chunks is controlled; through the --split parameter. Splitting the target database is less time-efficient due to the slow,; IO-limited merging of results, but it reduces the memory required on each server to:; ((7 * N * L) / #chunks + 21^k * 8) byte. Thus, it allows users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory; sizes. If the number of chunks is larger than the number of servers,; chunks will be distributed among servers and processed sequentially.

Availability,"notated reference databases, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 implements the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 (default) for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through an dynamic programming approach.; Prerequisites; MMseqs2 needs the NCBI taxonomy information (merged.dmp, names.dmp, nodes.dmp) and a mapping from sequences to the taxonomic identifier (targetDB_mapping).; Here is an example how to build a database for the Uniprot step by step.; The taxonomy workflow requires the NCBI taxonomy taxdump.tar.gz. It is available on the NCBI FTP server:; mkdir ncbi-taxdump && cd ncbi-taxdump; wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz; tar xzvf taxdump.tar.gz; cd .. Provide the path to the extraction location in the mmseqs taxonomy call as the <i:NcbiTaxdmpDir> parameter.; The workflow further requires a tab-separated mapping <i:targetTaxonMapping> with every target database identifier mapped to a NCBI taxon identifier. The convertkb module can generate this mapping for any database with UniProt accessions, such as the Uniclust, UniRef, and the UniProt itself:; # Turn the target sequences into a MMseqs2 database (this also creates targetDB.lookup); # Skip this step if you already created a database; mmseqs createdb target.fasta targetDB. # The targetDB.lookup file should be in the following format:; # numeric-db-id tab-character UniProt-Accession (e.g. Q6GZX4). # Any database with valid Uniprot identifier, contained in the Uniportkb, can be used (e.g. UniRef100_Q6GZX4); # Remove this prefix first:; # sed -i 's|UniRef100_||g' tar",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/eb089dcb6d4aadb514a1b36edec6a61216c5ef7d.html:36746,avail,available,36746,Home/eb089dcb6d4aadb514a1b36edec6a61216c5ef7d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/eb089dcb6d4aadb514a1b36edec6a61216c5ef7d.html,2,['avail'],['available']

Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules (detailed in YYY) to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot taxMappingFile and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier.

Greedy set cover removes the node with most connections and all connected nodes. These form a cluster and the procedure repeats until all nodes are in a cluster.; Connected component (--cluster-mode 1) uses transitive connection to cover more remote homologes. In connected component clustering starting at the mostly connected vertex, all vertices that are reachable in a breadth-first search are members of the cluster.; Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size.; Linclust is composed of five stages: 1.)

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

Availability,"or SILVA.; For other database types, the mapping must be created manually, as described in section Create a seqTaxDB by manual annotation of a sequence database. Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'. The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy calls an internal module lca that implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB:; mmseqs taxonomy queryDB seqTaxDB taxonomyResult tmp.

Availability,"or SILVA.; For other database types, the mapping must be created manually, as described in section Create a seqTaxDB by manual annotation of a sequence database. Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'. The concept of LCA; By identifying homologs through searches against a seqTaxDB, MMseqs2 can compute the lowest common ancestor. This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through a dynamic programming approach.; Using seqTaxDB for taxonomy assignment; The MMseqs2 module taxonomy implements an LCA assignment for sequences by querying them against a seqTaxDB:; mmseqs taxonomy queryDB seqTaxDB taxonomyResult tmp; mmseqs createtsv queryDB taxonomyResult taxonomyResult.tsv. Each line of the result file taxonomyResult.tsv will contain a tab separated list of 1) query accession, 2) LCA NCBI taxon ID, 3) LCA rank name, and 4) LCA scientific name.; The --lca-ranks parameter can be supplied with a comma (,) separated string of taxonomic ranks.

Mapping very similar sequences using mmseqs map. The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database. First it calls the prefilter module (with a low sensitivity setting) to detect high scoring diagonals and then computes an ungapped alignment with the rescorediagonal module. In contrast to the normal search, for maximum speed no gapped alignment is computed, query sequences are not masked for low complexity regions and no compositional bias correction is applied.; mmseqs map queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp.

This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomical labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1. The LCA will then be only computed through the usual search workflow parameters (--max-accept, -e, etc.).; The LCA implementation is based on the Go implementation of blast2lca software on GitHub. It implements the LCA computation efficiently through Range Minimum Queries through an dynamic programming approach.; Prerequisites; MMseqs2 needs the NCBI taxonomy information (merged.dmp, names.dmp, nodes.dmp) and a mapping from taxTargetDB sequences to the taxonomic identifier (targetDB_mapping).; The createtaxdb module will download the Uniprot taxMappingFile and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the targetDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier.; mmseqs createdb target.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createtaxdb targetDB tmp.

The map workflow of MMseqs2 finds very similar sequence matches in a sequence database. First it calls the prefilter module (with a low sensitivity setting) to detect high scoring diagonals and then computes an ungapped alignment with the rescorediagonal module. In contrast to the normal search, for maximum speed no gapped alignment is computed, query sequences are not masked for low complexity regions and no compositional bias correction is applied.; mmseqs map queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp.

Filtering a seqTaxDB; Once you have a seqTaxDB, you can use filtertaxseqdb to retain (or exclude) sequences based on their taxonomic labels. For example, if you wish to retain only sequences of eukaryotic origin:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxOnlyEuksDB --taxon-list 2759. or to exclude any human sequences:; mmseqs filtertaxseqdb seqTaxDB seqTaxNoHumanDB --taxon-list '!9606'.

This lowest common ancestor is a robust taxonomic label for unknown sequences.; MMseqs2 assigns taxonomic labels based on the lowest common ancestor of all equal scoring top hits --lca-mode 4 (default). However, we implemented several assignment strategies like the 2bLCA protocol (Hingamp et. al., 2013) with --lca-mode 2 for choosing a robust LCA. The second search can be disabled with --lca-mode 1.
