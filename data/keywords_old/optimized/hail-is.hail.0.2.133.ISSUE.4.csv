Deployability,"Stacked on #11995 . This PR creates all of the new `aggregated_*_resources_by_date` tables that will be used for real time billing and making our billing queries fast and also populates them! It will probably run for ~7-8 hours (online migration) and add an estimated 200 GB to the database. It will take around 5-6 hours to populate the tables and the remainder of the time is doing an audit. I think we should whiteboard what is going on in person, but the general idea is as follows:; 1. Revert any previous work and set the trigger back to the original state (idempotent); 2. Find the latest complete or open batch id. We know that a complete batch will not have updates to the attempts table. This is extremely important because the next steps can be done in parallel rather than serially.; 3. Find offsets for complete batches up to the batch id from Step 1 in groups of 100 attempts; 4. Randomize the offsets and have a burn in period of 5000 to avoid the birthday problem where we populate the `aggregated_*_resources_by_date` tables.; 5. In 10-way parallelism (maxes out a 4 core database), randomly populate the tables for each chunk.; 6. From the last offset (original first running batch id), we sequentially process attempts in groups of 100. We take note of where we are at with tracking any updates to the attempts table (`attempts_time_msecs_diff`), populate the `aggregated_*_resources_by_date` tables, and then do a final catchup step where we apply any updates from `attempts_time_msecs_diff` for any attempts that we have already processed.; 7. Once we have reached the ""end"" of the attempts table, we lock all tables of interest especially the `attempts` table, and do one last final processing step before we add the new triggers that will auto-populate the `aggregated_*_resources_by_date` tables.; 8. Then we perform an audit and make sure things look correct.

To briefly summarize, there are now the concept of batch updates. Each job belongs inside an ""update"". The BatchClient has two types of builders now: UpdateBatchBuilder and CreateBatchBuilder. I play some tricks with the job ids being allowed to be negative numbers denoting relative to an offset to make things more efficient when updating a batch because you don't have to make multiple API calls to get the current job offset in the batch. There are only two batch states in the database: `running` and `complete`. A batch starts out as `complete` until an update is committed at which point if the n_jobs > 0, it will change to `running`. The main thing to look at implementation-wise is the new stored procedure `commit_batch_update` with a nasty update that will block progress on the batch while the update is in progress. I added the updates to the UI. We can get rid of it if it's too confusing. There's also a `Time Updated` column now in the UI instead of `Time Closed`.; <img width=""1573"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 5 33 50 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693348/177875516-5f48e9a7-7fc2-4344-b3d2-c9560a846abe.png"">. <img width=""786"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 5 34 07 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693348/177875535-e9b3a99f-bdc9-4a3b-8a53-5d20df05f161.png"">",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010:372,update,updates,372,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010,8,"['Update', 'update']","['UpdateBatchBuilder', 'Updated', 'update', 'updates']"

Deployability,"Stacked on #7000. Adds a new IR renderer in Python which integrates a CSE pass. It would be easy to argue that a CSE pass should be separate from the renderer. But we can't easily make the Python IR mutable, because a given IR tree might be used in multiple larger IR (which is exactly what this pass is taking advantage of!) so mutation which depends on the larger context won't work. So rather than rebuild the entire IR every time we print, I decided for now this is best integrated into the renderer. I think longer term this should be ported to scala as a full CSE pass (which first does hash-consing/value-numbering to find all repeated subexpressions).

Deployability,"Stacked on: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7440. Changes:; - start the instance with a 1-time use activation token in the metadata; - on activation, clear the activation token, send the worker the normal token and batch-gsa-key; - upgrade the worker image to -6 which has the latest cloud-sdk (v269). As far as I can tell, the metadata server is still available from within the worker container after the upgrade, so I'm not 100% sure why this change was necessary. However, it will make things easier to lock down later. I think the picture we want is:; - store the worker and batch logs in different buckets,; - the worker instance service account only has instance.delete* and object.insert on the worker log bucket,; - the service account used by the worker only has object.insert on the batch logs bucket,; - we block access to the metdata srever from within the docker containers.Leaving this for reference:. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32512597/block-docker-access-to-specific-ip. This isn't 100% trivial because the metadata server is also the DNS server. We could try blocking everything except udp/53. I think ideally, we'd put the docker containers on a different network that could only route to the outside and use a public DNS server like 8.8.8.8. *An instance doesn't need extra permissions to shut itself down, so we could just do `shutdown -h now` on the worker and have the batch driver actually delete the instance.

Deployability,"Start of an IR node for joining two streams. ## Logic; Works off the ""producer"" pattern, where a stream is an object that you can; 1. Initialize, so the head of the stream is ready to be consumed.; 2. Step, so updates the current head to the next element in the stream. A join then takes two streams and its Step steps the left stream, the right stream, or both streams until a ""valid"" state is reached. E.g. In an outer join every step is a new valid state while an inner join must loop until the match condition is met. The node must also take some combining binary functions so as not to produce runtime tuples. Optional ""left"" and ""right"" functions determine at compilation time whether an unmatched pair of values should still produce a value (e.g. in a left join you always act, just either on just the left head or both). ## State of the code base; - Added `produce` abstract method to `ArrayEmitter`. Tests will fail until that is implemented on all the array nodes.; - Inserted a small hack to the `ir.ToArray` emit case that uses the producer route; - Added a test case for `ArrayJoin` (this one passes! :)); - Have not yet incorporated missingness into producer logic and have not implemented `consume` for ArrayJoin`.; - `Binds` needs to be updated to add the appropriate bindings for the children.

It's a somewhat thin wrapper around `click`, and I'm not entirely sold on one vs the other, but either seems a lot neater than argparse (I remember Cotton tried this years ago but I haven't looked at that PR). Click gives us the easy composition of CLIs, function name as the command name, the use of docstring as the description, help output, and most of the core functionality you see. Typer is the one translating python type hints into click type-checking, default setting, etc. Typer also uses rich if it's installed and allows you to install shell completion which is pretty neat, not sure if you can get that through click or if you need to use a click plugin.

Added local_tmpdir to `init`. tmpdir is the networked tmpdir. local_tmpdir is the tmpdir used for local files on both the driver and the executors. Added tmpdir and localTmpdir to ExecuteContext. ExecuteContext removes tmp files on close. Tmp file base is now required, try to give good base names. Tmp file names are now generated by being sufficiently random.; - Removed fs from HailContext. This involved threading ctx and fs through lots of code (most of the changes).; - Added ExecuteContext to EmitModuleBuilder and friends. This is necessary because EmitMethodBuilder gives generated code access to backend, fs, etc. which are carried by the ctx.; - Some IR (mostly readers, but also VEP, which needs to load the VEP configuration to determine its type) have overall parameters that control their behavior (e.g. the VCF reader path) but have to do IO to determine other state (like the matrix type, determined from the VCF header). This complicates pretty printing, serialization, and equality. I clarified this. In particular, I seperate the parameters (see, for example, MatrixVCFReaderParameters) which are specified on creation and used for serialization and equality from other derived state. IR no longer close over ctx or fs and they don't need to do IO after their intiial construction.; - MatrixSpec has subspecs for the marginal tables, and TableSpec has the global and rows RVD.

Deployability,"The issue is we start billing for instances as soon as they're created with the API. However, if an instance is stuck in provisioning and never activates, we never update the start billing time to account for the lack of resource. This PR uses the `lastStartTimestamp` in the [Google REST API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/get). This value is in RFC3339 format. I think this is the same format the timestamp in the activity logs, so I copied how we parse that value. If we delete the instance due to activation timeout, then we set the attempt start time to NULL so it's not billed. I couldn't find good documentation on this, but it seems like the `lastStartTimestamp` approximates what we care about for the purposes of checking for stuck workers. I checked it on an instance that was provisioning and the value was missing. Once the instance was in starting, the value was about 10 seconds after the `creationTimestamp`. . QUESTION: This does raise a question on whether we should be using the `lastStartTimestamp` when billing users if the difference is around 10 seconds. That will be a harder change, but is probably doable. We can't access the `lastStartTimestamp` through the metadata on the worker which would have been the easiest solution. We can get the compute client on the worker and access the `lastStartTimestamp` that way and set the job start time to the instance start time. I'd need to change the database for the attempts trigger to account for this.

Well, that and you can add another developer to a dev namespace as a developer without destroying the developer's existing namespace. Subsequent PRs will introduce on-demand dev namespaces and the ability to suspend the deletion of a test namespace. New context added to the CI pipeline is treated as optional to be backward compatible with the current CI. So devs won't be able to log in to test namespaces on *this* PR but will be able to once this PR becomes main. ### What has changed; - All developers from default are now added to all test namespaces using the `add_users` build.yaml step and removed at the end of the PR run through the `delete_users` step. These use the normal create and delete API instead of copying the user's gsa from the production namespace. This relies on / tests that the delete user endpoint is properly deleting cloud identities when the users are deleted (previously broken in GCP but fixed in this PR.; - The developer role no longer implicitly deletes and recreates a corresponding namespace. I wanted adding developers to test namespaces not to have side-effects that leaked out of the namespace. A follow-up PR will incorporate the ability for a developer to request an on-demand dev namespace, which should be made a lot easier after these changes. I think this also means that we can remove some permissions from the auth K8s ServiceAccount since it no longer needs the ability to create and delete namespaces.; - A fixed-but-sufficient number of oauth2 callbacks are hard-coded into the oauth2 secret from GCP/azure and then allocated to a given namespace.

Deployability,"The original goal of this PR was avoiding `Try` when we are not using the restartability provided by semantic hashing because I strongly suspect it is related to the loss of stacktraces in exceptions. Unrelatedly, we realized the semantic hash PR changed the semantics of Query-on-Spark even when semantic hash is disabled: previously we would abort RDD writing on the first exception. In Hail 0.2.123 through 0.2.126, the semantics were changed to only crash *after* we already ran every other partition. Two bad scenarios of which I can think:. 1. Suppose the first partition fails due to OOM. We now waste time/money on the rest of the partitions even though we cannot possibly get a valid output. 2. Suppose every partition hits a permission error. Users should get that feedback after paying for O(1) partitions run, not O(N). I created two Backend paths: the normal `parallelizeAndComputeWithIndex` with its pre-0.2.123 semantics as well as `parallelizeAndComputeWithIndexReturnAllErrors` which, as the name says, returns errors instead of raising them. While making this change, I think I found two other bugs in the ""return all errors"" path, only one of which I addressed in this PR:. 1. I'm pretty sure semantic-hash-enabled QoB batch submission is broken because it uses the logical partition ids as job indices. Suppose there are 10,000 partitions, but we only need to compute 1, 100, and 1543. 0.2.126 would try to submit a batch of size 3 but whose job indices are 1, 100, and 1543. 2. Likewise, the Query-on-Spark path returns an invalid `SparkTaskContext.partitionId` which, at best, produces confusing partition filenames. I only fixed the former because it was simple to fix. I wasn't exactly sure what to do about the latter. We should fix that separately because the changes in this PR need to urgently land in the next release to avoid unexpected cost when one partition fails.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14085:1839,release,release,1839,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14085,1,['release'],['release']

There is a further discussion here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/26567. Short-term fix: we could delete the pod and recreate on upgrade, which would lead to a short window of downtime. Long-term fix: Normally the certs are only read by nginx, but need to be written by the certbot renew cron job. We could keep the certs in a volume. We could put a copy of the certs in a secret which can be mounted by multiple pods (e.g. site including when it is upgraded). Then we run certbot periodically in its own pod and update the original certs stored in the volume.

The version is written by make into `python/spark_version` and read by `python/setup.py`. Many of the tests pass against 2.3.0, but there's some floating point value changes. - add breezeVersions for all currently released Spark versions greater than 2.2.0. - For developers, require python package `py` version 1.7.0 or later to allow `pytest` to test an installed package while loading the doctest expressions from the source code.

It is intended to be used like this:. ```; VERSION = 30; $(eval $(call ENV_VAR,VERSION)). build: env/VERSION; build:; ... $(VERSION) ...; ```. Each time this Makefile is executed, at Makefile parse-time, `make` evaluates the `ifneq` to compare the current value of the variable to the previously used value (if any). If they differ, a phony (ergo always needs to be rebuilt) target is dynamically generated.

Deployability,"There are many global config fields that CI needs in order to template build.yaml jobs that are threaded through to CI with environment variables. However, these variables are never actually used by CI and they introduce some needless dependencies to run CI (you need a GCP_PROJECT, for example, even though CI doesn't care at all). Instead of setting specific environment variables for each field that build.yaml steps need, I instead mount the global-config (read-only) to the CI container and read in the whole thing. This does potentially expose more variables to the build.yaml environment than there were previously, but I argue that none of those should be sensitive anyway or maybe don't belong in the global-config (which shouldn't be sensitive). This in part makes the process of adding global config fields easier, since right now you need separate PRs to 1) introduce the field to CI and then 2) use it in a new build.yaml step.

These are nearly always environment variables (but not always), which can and sometimes are read from kubernetes secrets. This is a sweep of every such occurence I could find so that these variables are just read directly from the k8s secret. Though it adds lines to the deployments, it reduces the complexity of our Makefile process and makes adding variables to the global config much easier. This also *dramatically* reduces the dependencies on `config.mk` and most of its variables.

Deployability,"This PR adds a new token and time_completed column to the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table. The reason for doing this is twofold:. 1. This will get rid of the serialization in MJC where every job needs to update the same row in the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table.; 2. We also push marking the batch complete to outside of the MJC stored procedure as a separate database query. The current code for marking a batch complete won't work for job groups (or at least not without a complicated query I don't know how to easily write) because the job group completion state check needs to be vectorized up the ancestors tree. The mechanism for how this works is there is a new `mark_batch_complete` function in Python that is executed after every MJC. There's also a periodic loop that looks for batches that are complete (n_jobs == n_completed), but have not had state = ""complete"". This makes sure we eventually update the batch state when complete even if MJC is interrupted. The new `mark_batch_complete` function optimistically tries to update the batch state and time_completed if `n_jobs == n_complete AND state != ""complete""`. If an update occurs, then the function issues a callback if specified; otherwise, it just returns. `time_completed` is tracked as a new column on the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table where we take the GREATEST timepoint when updating a row on duplicate key. Then the time_completed is just equal to the MAX of all entries in the table for that batch. I'm still proving backwards compatibility to myself without manually copying time_completed to the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table from the `batches` table. I believe that if we have a running batch:. (A) MJC in SQL uses the new token column when inserting into `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states`, but all new entries are always inserted at token=0 so the original SQL queries currently running on the server execute the same.

Deployability,"This PR adds support for Azure SAS tokens in QoB. A SAS token is basically a blob storage URI with a short-lived credential to access that resource appended as a URL query string. In such a scenario where the FS receives a blob URI with a SAS token, that token should be used instead of the latent credentials on the system. Most of the changes to the `AzureStorageFS.scala` are to parse out a SAS token from blob names. This change brings with it a couple caveats. Unfortunately it is not possible to truly disambiguate a SAS token from a glob pattern, or even just a normal blob filename. So we take what is probably a safe assumption and look to see if there exists a query-parameter style key-value pair after the last `?` in the blob name. If this is the case, we treat everything after the last `?` as a SAS token. If this condition is not satsified, we say there is no SAS token and treat the whole path as the blob name. This logic already exists in python, but I'm open to alternatives. Introducing SAS tokens also breaks the way globbing is currently implemented, where it is deemed safe to iteratively append components to the end of a blob URI string. I added an abstract type member to `FS` and instead of a `String` have `globWithPrefix` accept that associated URL type that can properly handle path updates. I'm unclear on the best way to do this w.r.t. the type system, and wasn't quite sure what to put as the associated type for `RouterFS`, which ideally would accept a union of the URL types for the filesystems that it wraps, so some guidance on that would be great if you have any.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13178:1314,update,updates,1314,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13178,1,['update'],['updates']

A couple of nuances in the implementation came up that I also tried to articulate in the RFC:; 1. A root job group with ID = 0 does not belong to an update (""update_id"" IS NULL). This means that any checks that look for ""committed"" job groups need to do `(batch_updates.committed OR job_groups.job_group_id = %s)` where ""%s"" is the ROOT_JOB_GROUP_ID.; 2. When job groups are cancelled, only the specific job group that was cancelled is inserted into `job_groups_cancelled`. This table does **NOT** contain all transitive job groups that were also cancelled indirectly. The reason for this is we cannot guarantee that a user wouldn't have millions of job groups and we can't insert millions of records inside a single SQL stored procedure. Now, any query on the driver / front_end must look up the tree and see if any parent has been cancelled. This code looks similar to the code below [1].; 3.

Deployability,"This PR changes the semantics of TableMapRows in the IR and Table.select. They are now required to preserve the key ordering. In other words, applying TableMapRows to an ordered table can produce an ordered table without shuffling. I put an assert to verify that the produced OrderedRVD is really ordered, but that might be too expensive an assertion. Before, `newKey = None` meant ""keep the old key"", but that left no room to ask for the result to be unkeyed. Now `newKey` is just the key of the resulting table. If any partition key fields are modified, then even if the ordering is preserved, the result will need to be scanned to update the partition bounds. To avoid this scan when unnecessary, I added the `preservedKeyFields` parameter, which is the length of the prefix of key fields which are not modified. Thus, if the number of partition keys of the underlying OrderedRVD is less than or equal to `preservedKeyFields`, the partition bounds will remain valid.

Deployability,"This PR introduces a new type `Name` for representing bound variables in the IR, replacing `String`. For now, it is just an `AnyVal` wrapper around `String`, but in the future I would like to take advantage of the new type. For example, I'd like to:; * change equality of `Name` from string comparison to comparing object identity with `eq`. That way `freshName` becomes just `new Name()`, with stronger guarantees that the new name doesn't occur anywhere in the current IR, without needing to maintain global state as we do now.; * get rid of `NormalizeNames`, instead enforcing the global uniqueness of names as a basic invariant of the IR (typecheck could also check this invariant); * keep a string in the `Name`, but no longer require it to be unique. Instead it's just a suggestion for how to show the name in printouts, adding a uniqueifying suffix as needed.

Deployability,"This PR is a step towards a general picture for generating debugging information in bytecode. The general picture is to write a sequence of files, each corresponding to a certain point in the compile pipeline, where each line in each file includes a line number pointing to the line in the previous file from which this line was derived. (We may eventually want richer source information than just a single line number, like a range or list of ranges.) The top of each file has the file name of the previous printout, which is the target of all line numbers in the file. We could in the future also print a list of transformations that were applied to get from the previous printed state to this one. The idea to implement this picture is simple. Each IR node stores a line number in a mutable variable. When we want to generate a printed checkpoint, we walk the IR, printing a representation of each node, including the stored line number, and then overwriting the node's line number with the current line count of the file being written to. Some work will be required to preserve this source information in all IR transformations. This PR implements this idea in lir only. If the `HAIL_WRITE_IR_FILES` environment variable is set, it is hardcoded to print the lir after the first `SimplifyControl` (because before that is very hard to read), and after method splitting right before emitting bytecode. It also prints out the class files themselves.

I added a secret to default named `ssl-config-hail-root` containing `hail-root-key.pem`, and `hail-root-cert.pem`. Every principal trusts this root. This root trusts every principal. This PR originally prevented clients from speaking to servers with certs they didn't trust. Now everyone trusts everyone. As long as the root key is not leaked this is OK. Only `create_certs` mounts this secret. The key is used to sign every certificate and the cert is included in each principal's incoming and outgoing trust lists. The root certificate and key are never re-created, so our deploys have no downtime and we avoid addressing the rotation problem. I removed all the trust specifications. A later PR will resolve rotation and mTLS. That PR will restore the trust specifications. I didn't change the structure of the secrets (they still have an incoming and outgoing trust list which only contains the root cert) because I need this structure for mTLS anyway.

It looks scary, but this is the model we currently have). Thanks to #11053, which is the current version of the CI deployment in Azure, this required no change to the CI application code. ### Sidebar; It might look weird that I've added a block here for the kubernetes provider. That is because up until now I've kept all the k8s and azure terraform in separate root modules, so that they need to be `terraform apply`'d separately and therefore their provider blocks were separated as well. While keeping the code isolated is good (the k8s modules can be reused for GCP), putting them in separate apply's was purely because of [this bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-kubernetes/issues/1028) in the kubernetes provider. I ran into it when experimenting tearing clusters down and putting them back up again. However, it has since proven very cumbersome to manage two different terraform states where one relies heavily on the other and I've changed my mind. The bug in question has a PR forthcoming and is really only a problem when tearing a K8s cluster down and rebuilding it while preserving other terraform state, which isn't something I see us dealing with often past initial development. Thus, I've added the k8s provider block so that I can directly invoke the CI k8s module. I'll follow up with a PR that moves the other k8s module invocations in here as well.

Currently, there's an nginx sitting in front of prometheus so that the prometheus UI can be exposed at prometheus.hail.is with https and dev authentication. This hasn't changed. Currently though, grafana is piggybacking on this flow by forwarding the user's session (which I set up in the UI), but I couldn't figure out an easy way to set that in the config and it seemed unnecessarily complicated.

Deployability,"This adds the following pieces of infrastructure:. - Fully scripted bootstrapping process, from creating a managed identity to run terraform through (instead of the current service principal), to creating a VM to run the bootstrap process off of, through all following steps until running bootstrap.py; - Adds the root CA certificate that azure uses to sign the MySQL server certificates so that we can connect to the database with `VERIFY_CA`. Unlike gcp, however, this still doesn't allow us to use mTLS since it doesn't look like we can request a client cert/key for our database. Still this is not so bad for now.; - Creates a separate k8s module for terraform. This currently just holds the global-config and sql-config resources, but establishes a boundary between the cloud-specific terraform and purely k8s terraform. Later on I'll refactor the GCP terraform to use the k8s module so that different clouds can use the same k8s configuration.; - Adds a pool of spot instances to the AKS cluster and adds the required toleration to all of our preemptible deployments. Part of the node selection process for a pod requires that exist a toleration on the pod for every taint on the node. In other words, it is ok for a pod to have redundant tolerations, so it's fine to have azure-specific tolerations even if we're running in gcp.; - Refactor the az-create-worker-image.sh script to complete the entire batch worker image creation process from start to finish. This involved sending a command over ssh that previously had to be executed by hand. This meant we could combine the two-script process into one shell script. This fully matches the google setup we have currently up until running `bootstrap.py`, which is still google-specific, mainly w.r.t. gcp service accounts.

Deployability,"This also fixes the currently broken `delete_*_tables` steps. In the past, all dev and test databases shared the same MySQL Server (with production), so instead of each service getting its own dedicated database, there was one database per dev/test namespace with all the tables for all the services. This made it difficult to reset the database state of a particular service -- you needed to explicitly delete only the tables for that particular service. Nowadays, dev and test databases live on their own MySQL Servers, so each service gets its own database (like in production). This makes it a lot easier to reset a service's database, we just drop the MySQL database for that service. This PR makes that change, deletes all the now unused `delete-*-tables.sql` files, and adds a dev doc explaining how to reset a dev database. The reason these steps were broken is that the sql configs in dev/test namespaces use K8s DNS for the `host`, which does not work out of the box in batch jobs because they are not in the K8s network. There's code in `database.py` that uses the K8s API to resolve the database host to an IP address that the batch jobs can access. This is why I wrote a python script instead of just using `mysql`. I tested these with the following dev deploy, which scrapped everything and I was able to log in after it was done!. ```; hailctl dev deploy -b daniel-goldstein/hail:dev-ns-delete-db -s delete_auth_tables,delete_batch_tables,deploy_batch,add_developers; ```. cc: @sjparsa, @iris-garden given your recent dev namespace woes",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13456:1267,deploy,deploy,1267,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13456,2,['deploy'],['deploy']

If we push on every image build, the private docker registry will accumulate a lot of `hail-ubuntu:dev-xxxxxx` tags that are never used again because `hail-ubuntu` is just an intermediate used to build other images.

Deployability,"This change creates mysql pods for test and dev namespaces, instead of sharing the CloudSQL database server. The areas of change are as follows:. ### Generation of the namespace's database-server-config; The current approach in main does a little trick. Since the current `createDatabase` step uses the `database-server-config` from default to generate admin/user sql configs, the CI pipeline creates a dummy database `test-database-instance` to create a `sql-test-instance-admin-config` that inherits the credentials from the production `database-server-config`, and then copies that within the test namespace to `database-server-config`. In this change, since we are creating the server ourselves, we can just replace these with a step that creates a `database-server-config` from scratch, and then uses that for the DB pod. Overall making these changes really gave me the heebie jeebies that the test and dev namespaces have all these credentials to the CloudSQL server. I'm glad this gets rid of that. ### Accessing the database server; We use the DB pod's service DNS name as the `host` so inside Kubernetes this Just Works. The one caveat is the CI pipeline in which we run migrations in batch jobs. Those jobs need a way to reach the DB pod. I achieve this with a NodePort and then use the job's K8s credentials to resolve the node and port that the DB is on. The code I've added to do this resolution feels a bit janky, wouldn't mind some feedback on that. In terms of security, if a user job was able to somehow resolve the address of a test db, they would still not have the credentials to access it, and this is currently also the case with the production database. Nevertheless, this does raise an action item that we should only allow traffic to the k8s and DB subnets for `network=private` jobs, but I think we should make that a separate PR. ### Database creation; In order to test this properly in a dev deploy, I needed to make some changes to `create_database.py`.

Deployability,"This introduces a new version of the batch worker instance: one without `docker`. Instead we bring in `podman` to cover the functions of pulling images, extracting expanding filesystems from those images, and running the worker container. `podman` by default uses `crun` as its low-level runtime so we can get rid of the independent `crun` installation in the worker image. `podman` is daemonless and can be run rootless. For the most part you can't tell the difference, except this makes `podman` easy to run under multiple users with different caches per user. So if you ssh into a worker, be sure to `sudo` before any `podman` (or `crun`) command or else you might think nothing is running when in fact the worker is running under root's podman configuration. The podman/crun state directories are now shared between the host and the worker so `sudo crun list` on the worker should reveal the running job containers without having to exec into the worker first. For the most part, `podman` is a drop-in replacement for `docker`, but there are a handful of inconsistencies that comprise most of this PR.

Deployability,"This introduces the necessary pieces of infrastructure to run CI in GCP and a couple of small changes such that it can run as a secondary CI. This is currently failing because one of the secrets I introduce here in the terraform does not exist in hail-vdc. If you approve of the approach I can add it in manually. . ## Terraform changes; This adds a new CI terraform module that adds a CI bucket, sets some permissions for the CI service account and adds some K8s secrets like github tokens and the zulip config. This allows the terraform deployment to optionally include resources needed for CI. This was the best way I could think to introduce this infra with the least changes, but it's not what I want in the long term. Right now we have one monolithic root module that includes all the resources necessary to run batch, with the option for tacking on CI. I would rather extract most of our root module into a `batch` module (and while we're break down the innards into modules like vdc, db, etc.) and have the root module be something that can be easily pieced together from the library of modules. This would be a decently big refactor and more importantly would require existing deployments to manually overhaul their terraform state, so it's something I want to do carefully but also sooner is better than later. Given how terraform state is indexed, I believe more modularity will be easier to manage in the long term. ## CI changes; This adds the following features to CI; - Watched branches can be marked as `mergeable`. `mergeable=true` should be the default behavior and `false` prevents CI from merging a PR on GitHub. This allows multiple CI's to run tests in different environments without stepping on each others' toes.

This pairs nicely with the following goal; - We only ever use 1 version of a dependency across the monorepo.

Deployability,"This is part of a minor bug-fix for how CI tracks active namespaces in development environments. #12093 added a table in CI's database that tracks the namespaces that CI is currently aware exists and that it manages. Non-production CIs don't really use this table (dev CIs don't update gateway routing or anything), but it's useful in development to see that CI is properly updating its database tables as it would in prod. In #12093, the migration that adds the `active_namespaces` table explicitly adds entries for the `default` namespace. However, I'm now realizing that this is a mistake, because a CI in the `dgoldste` namespace shouldn't have an entry for `default`, it should instead have an entry for `dgoldste`. That migration should have been parametrized by the namespace the migration is happening in. To do this, I need to expose the current namespace to the migration scripts, hence this PR.

Deployability,"This is the current state of the C++ support. If you look at the tests in src/test/is/hail/nativecode/NativeCodeSuite.scala that should give a; quick overview of how it works, viz. 1. Generate C++ source code as a Scala String, then create a NativeModule which handles; the grunt work of getting it compiled, linked, and loaded, and allows you to look up functions; by name, and get a callable Scala object corresponding to the C++ function. 2. The NativeModule also allows the binary of the DLL to be passed around and instantiated; on other cluster nodes (but note that those nodes will need to have the correct versions of; the C++ runtime shared libraries in the right directories to allow symbols in the DLL to be; correctly resolved). This is not tested yet. 3. I have been using llvm-6.0.0 on Mac, and llvm-5.0 on linux. It makes a half-hearted attempt; to use whatever other compiler you have, but that may not work. We probably need to figure; out a standardized and automated way to get the right tools installed in the right place (and; get the right shared libraries on worker nodes). 4. Data which needs to be accessible to both Scala and C++ is held in C++ objects inheriting; from NativeObj, with lifetimes managed by std::shared_ptr, i.e. reference-counted. There's; some dirty under-the-hood plumbing to allow a shared_ptr to be smuggled into a Scala; object derived from NativeBase. These Scala-side object references must be managed; carefully using copyAssign/moveAssign/close in order to maintain the off-heap ref-counts. 5. There are some gnarly differences between Linux and MacOSX in the linker and dynamic; loading. I think I'm converging on the right compile/link options for each, but in getting; Linux to work it's possible that Mac is temporarily broken ...

Deployability,"This should fix the test_copy failures. The problem was, we were sending a mutable byte iterator for data when inserting a new object. If that insert read some of the data, failed, and was retried, the data that was read was lost and the retry started where the failed insert left off. To retry writes, you need to keep around the data you've sent to resend in case of failure. So you don't have to keep around an unbounded amount of data, Google Storage supports resumable uploads: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/resumable-uploads. This allows us to send data in chunks, and release the data after Google reports back that the data has been committed. `StorageClient.insert_object`, when the upload type is resumable (the default), takes an additional argument `bufsize`. This is the amount the amount that the writer will buffer for retries, and the size of the chunks sent to GCS. I kept around the simpler media upload type since I actually want to use it in copy (copy doesn't need to buffer because it can retry by rereading the file being copied from). This code was actually kind of hard to organize. It would be better if the code immediately wrote any incoming data instead of just buffering it until we hit the chunk size, but I didn't find a manageable way to write that. Suggestions welcome, tho it would be good to get this fix in because of the test failures.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10023:583,release,release,583,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10023,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Turns out pandas dataframes have an `.attrs` field to store ""globals"". So now I group by discrete values and collect them as globals, and I get one pandas dataframe per group of discrete values. This makes things a bit less complicated I think. . As part of this change, I now create scales based on looking at all the collected data, not just one particular geom's data. This is more correct for things like continuous color, where if I have one geom that has points in color range 0 - .5, and another geom that has points in color range .5-1, there should be a continuous color gradient between 0 and 1, not two separate ones from 0 - .5 and .5 - 1. . This will also allow me to support things like `scale_color_hue`, which is the default R way of picking discrete colors by choosing evenly spaced points on a color wheel. I can't pick evenly spaced points if I don't know how many discrete values of `color` I have across all geoms. Summary of actual code changes:. 1. Don't flatten out grouped data. Stats use `group_by` to group by discrete aesthetics, but prior to this PR they would just forget that grouping information and flatten out the data, only to redetermine the grouping information later. This prevents that entirely by storing the per group information in a dataframes `attrs`. ; 2. Update geoms to reflect they are getting data in this form. This simplifies away the need to have a specified `take_one` boolean for each aesthetic a geom supports that said whether it's a per data point or per group field.; 3. Replace `Scale.transform_local_data` with `Scale.create_local_transformer`. This takes in all the data and returns a lambda to map over the data.

Deployability,"Under ideal conditions, I observed this code complete 12 jobs per second in a 1000 job; batch. However, it's usually closer to 6 jobs per second. There's still a deadlock in; `mark_job_complete` which hamstrings performance. I haven't thought carefully about why my metric; (jobs per second) is much lower than our usual metric (MJC per second). I will eventually squash; the `mark_job_complete` deadlock, but I haven't the time currently. The two main issues were the `batches` field `cancelled` and the `instances` field; `free_cores_mcpu`. We frequently locked the entire batch row just to prevent a batch from being; cancelled while other work was done. This effectively serialized all operation on jobs in the same; batch. We had the dual issue with free_cores_mcpu: we lock the entire instance record everywhere to; prevent the instance changing state while we update job information.

This method calls the instance method `in_region()` to check if the dataset is available in the requested region.; - If `in_region()` determines the desired region is not available for some dataset that otherwise is available in another region, it will raise a warning.

Deployability,"We seem to be running into spark/yarn scheduling limitations causing stages to often fail with a large number of partitions. Here, we implement a very simple chunking strategy to run spark jobs with a limited number of partitions at a time. The maximum parallelism is controlled by a new `spark_max_stage_parallelism` feature flag, which defaults to MAXINT until we can figure out a good default. Also, this change corrects a small error in logic for partition indices for call caching. The `resultHandler` argument of [`runJob`] is called with the job's partition index, not the index of the partition within the RDD. So we need to index into the `partitions` sequence when populating the results buffer.

For example, if a user is using the synchronous interface of hail inside a jupyter cell (which runs an event loop). `nest_asyncio` achieves this by patching the `asyncio` event loop to make it reentrant, and with that there are footguns. This allows us to do things like create 100 tasks that all concurrently invoke `run_until_complete`, each of which will add stack frames to the event loop stack that can pile up and trigger a cryptic `RecursionError`. But internally we never *need* to make concurrent calls to `run_until_complete`, and more broadly we should never have `async / sync / async` inside hail code.

Deployability,"We've had a number of pip issues recently, particularly incompatibilities with the `six` package. The central issue is that pip will install incompatible package versions with only a warning message. This primarily happens when a set of packages is installed (say in a parent image) and then a new set of packages are installed later. Pip attempts to satisfy all requirements of the packages in an installed set, but it does not consider the versions of packages already installed. In this PR, I pervasively change every use of `pip` to be followed by the use of `pip check`. Pip check errors if there are incompatible package versions installed. Rather than change every place that we use `pip install`, I created an ubuntu image with a script, `hail-pip-install`, and pip configuration which makes it easy to do the right thing. Now, we should always install python packages like this:. ```; hail-pip-install package1 package2 package3; ```. The script will ensure that all packages are compatible with existing packages. Moreover, it will retry downloads five times. I did not make every Dockerfile depend on the new hail-ubuntu-image because they are legacy Dockerfile that I didn't want to edit. These include the benchmark Dockerfile and some notebook workers. PySpark presented a challenge because we did not install it via pip. As a result, packages, such as Hail, which depend on PySpark failed the `pip check`. I modified all uses of PySpark to instead use the standard pip-installed version of PySpark.

Deployability,"We've had to do a redeploy of our hail batch instance on Azure. This PR resolves/clarifies two issues we encountered. 1) Storage Account Name Uniqueness. Due to Azure's restrictions on storage account naming (mainly that names must be globally unique) the redeploy did not succeed. This is because the resource group name (we chose to reuse hail) is possible under a new subscription, but the generated storage account names were therefore identical to our previous stack. I've added in an argument called `storage_account_suffix` to account for this issue. It can be set to any arbitrary string that complies with Azure's storage account naming scheme in order to avoid naming conflicts in the future. While the option remains to simply choose a novel resource group name this is not enforced by Azure and anyone deploying a stack similarly named to someone else would not know until the `terraform apply` stage that the name would not work. 2) Mysql Flexible Server Zones. The only other issue is that the zone argument for the mysql flexible server is no longer always valid depending on your compute region.

The first thing this paragraph recommends is the `Overview`, which is the wrong first step in my opinion, unless we rewrite the overview.

A geneticist does not want to arrive at `import_vcf`/`variant_qc`/`sample_qc` by first slowly walking through our weird version of lazy typed python. I think putting the tutorials first would be a good first step. Going through all the tutorials in order (even they we really mostly like the first tutorial) is more useful than jumping into hail types. . I also don't like the ordering on the sidebar.

I propose here getting rid of the run-tests image and just putting plink in the hail-run image. I also remove the dependency on service-base and just install hailtop in the hail-run image -- I don't think anything hail/hail should depend on services code. This change actually revealed an accidental dependency where there was a gear (services) test in the hail/python tests. I moved that over to the batch suite as batch is the primary user of that class and we don't have a gear suite atm. Ultimately, I think we should have a pretty flat docker image hierarchy. Each of our Dockerfiles does a decent job of following the docker mantra of dependencies first, code later.

Deployability,"`'/api/v1alpha/batches/create-fast'` is a Batch API endpoint that allows you to create a batch, submit jobs, and start them running all in one HTTP request. It makes a few transactions within the endpoint and must be idempotent. One of the failure modes it must watch for is when a Batch Update to add some new jobs and/or job groups to a batch has already successfully been committed, but the request is retried for X reason. In that scenario, we want to just return a 200 to the client. We do this already, but there was an oversight when creating job groups where those branches did not include the full response payload, which results in intermittent errors on the client when it can't retrieve `resp['last_job_group_id']`.

Deployability,"`network=private` is an escape hatch for CI so certain jobs can talk to internal endpoints on our network that we do not permit user jobs to reach. In `main`, all CI jobs are hard-coded to use `private` in `build.py`, but few jobs in the CI pipeline actually require these heightened privileges. The steps in the CI pipeline are of the following types:. - `BuildImageStep`: These do not need to use the private network and have now all been made to use the public network namespaces; - `CreateDatabaseStep`: These *do* need to use `network='private'` because all our DBs only have private IPs on our internal network; - `RunImageStep`: Those steps that contact the DB need the private network. This PR makes the network configurable for these steps but default to public, so steps that need DB access explicitly do `network: private`; - `DeployStep`: These do not need to use the private network because they use the public K8s API server endpoint. Whether they should is perhaps a different question. I'm open to keeping these on the private networks and creating an issue to use the internal API server endpoint instead. We definitely have a static internal IP in GKE but I don't believe we have one for AKS and that would involve some research.; - `CreateNamespaceStep`: I don't believe that this needs the private network because it is functionally the same as a `DeployStep` in that it just talks to K8s, but I am unable to test this step in `test_ci` so I am reluctant to make a change that could brick CI.

Let's look at an example:. ```python3; server_ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context(; purpose=Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH,; cafile='/incoming.cacerts'); server_ssl_context.load_cert_chain(ssl_config['cert'],; keyfile=ssl_config['key'],; password=None); server_ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL; server_ssl_context.check_hostname = False; ```. The first function call states that we are a *server* performing *client; authentication* (`Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH`). We also state that anyone who sends requests to us will be; identified by a certificate that is trusted by our certificate database: `/incoming.cacerts` (which; is a file). `load_cert_chain` states where to find the certificates and secret key that prove who we are. The; certificate and secret key together are like a property title that proves someone owns a house. The; `password=None` means that our secret key has no password. Some keys are themselves locked by a; password. `verify_mode` means what do we expect our clients to have. `CERT_OPTIONAL` means anonymous clients; are OK. This is how servers normally operate (https://google.com does not care who you are). `check_hostname` means should we verify that the client certificate matches the client's; hostname. Since we allow anonymous clients, this must be `False`. ---. `test-address.py` is a gross hack. It will disappear in subsequent PRs.

Deployability,"a few things happening here, most of which was me trying to not have to explicitly list dependencies in the shadowJar/shadowTestJar tasks:; - upgraded gradle to 5.0 and some plugins to be compatible; - split compile dependencies into ""bundled"" and ""unbundled"" to more explicitly separate the things we want in the jars and dependencies that we don't want bundled/are currently depending on the spark installation for. I did it this way because the shadowJar `exclude` filter does not let you exclude transitive dependencies, and I just wanted to exclude the entire spark/scala dependency tree.; - there was a problem where trying to run the tests kept giving me the ""Could not find or load main class org.testng.TestNG"" error, despite the class clearly being findable from the classpath I was providing.

Deployability,"all change to `conftest.py` triggered a bad diff: I added a `try`/`finally` block to ensure we always return to the original working directory. I also fixed the path. - Use pytest [recommended directory structure](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html) when your tests directory is a python module [1]. In particular, we now use:. ```; python/; - setup.py; - src/; - hail/; - __init__.py; - ...; - tests/; - __init__.py; - ...; ```. - Calculate number of cores using python's multiprocessing and use that as a default PARALLELISM parameter. - Move non-java/scala specific functionality out of `build.gradle` and into a `Makefile`. - The resulting rules are more succinct and correctly rely on file-system modification dependencies. - No use of `SPARK_HOME` and `PYTHONPATH`, and limited use of `PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS`. Python tests now rely on the python package directly which handles correctly handles dependencies like `pyspark`. - There are also some phony targets for convenience: `jar`, `zip`, `pip-install`, `docs`, and `docs-no-test`. - Fix configuration of Spark version for the python package. The version is written by make into `python/spark_version` and read by `python/setup.py`. Many of the tests pass against 2.3.0, but there's some floating point value changes. - add breezeVersions for all currently released Spark versions greater than 2.2.0. - For developers, require python package `py` version 1.7.0 or later to allow `pytest` to test an installed package while loading the doctest expressions from the source code. (We could also determine where hail was installed and pass that path to pytest instead of `python/src`, but using the environment variable `PY_IGNORE_IMPORTMISMATCH` seems simple and safe enough). ---. ### Explainers. #### env_var.mk. This is a Makefile that is intended to be `include`d by other Makefiles.

This is a Makefile that is intended to be `include`d by other Makefiles.

It is intended to be used like this:. ```; VERSION = 30; $(eval $(call ENV_VAR,VERSION)). build: env/VERSION; build:; ... $(VERSION) ...; ```. Each time this Makefile is executed, at Makefile parse-time, `make` evaluates the `ifneq` to compare the current value of the variable to the previously used value (if any). If they differ, a phony (ergo always needs to be rebuilt) target is dynamically generated. That target will force a execution of any dependent targets, in the example above, it will force `build` to be executed. If the variable's current value and it's previous value do not differ, no target is generated and thus nothing is executed. #### MAKEFLAGS += --no-builtin-rules. This disables all the automatic rules, making Makefile parsing/interpretation faster. #### .SUFFIXES:. This sets the suffixes to nothing, disabling a bunch of implicit rules. For example, the rule for compiling C files. #### Breeze versions. I found the breeze versions by manually looking at the Spark pom file at the tags for each release, starting with [2.2.0](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.2.0/pom.xml#L654). ---.

Deployability,"atch is cancelled, it will be cancelled (not always_run),; - a job is runnable if it is ready but has not been cancelled. Now we aim to incremental maintain the following information:. Globally:; - runnable jobs and cores. Per user:; - runnable and running jobs and cores,; - running cancelled jobs, and; - ready cancelled jobs. The global runnable cores are needed by the instance pool controller. The per-user stats are needed by the three threads of the scheduler:; - for the fair share allocator and the scheduler,; - to cancel running jobs on workers that have been cancelled (because the batch was cancelled),; - to cancel ready jobs that have been cancelled (either because the batch was cancelled or a parent failed). In order to update these values efficiently when a batch is cancelled, we also track in `batch_cancellable_resources` table, per batch:; - cancellable ready jobs and cores,; - cancellable running jobs and cores.; I added a `cancel_batch` procedure that uses these values to update ready_cores and user_resources when a batch is cancelled. I also reorganized the threads of the scheduler. Each one uses the above structures to compute a fair share for each user of work to do in a give iteration (dividing up 1000 tasks, with a per-user min of 20). Those tasks are then executed with 100-way parallelism. Other changes:; - I added a recompute_incremental procedure for recomputing all the incremental structures,; - I added a batches.state field (open, running or complete) and removed the closed column,; - I updated the batch and jobs indexes to make sure all scheduler queries are probably indexed. This isn't the case right now and we're seeing a lot of load on the database because of it. I'm going to do some more testing and possibly rename some stuff, but it is passing and the incremental structures all line up at the end of the tests. The only issue I see is I loop through all running batches for a user in the scheduler.

GitHub uses these URLs to send updates to the CI under test about the watched repositories. - `test-locally.sh` now installs `../batch` into the currently running `pip` before testing (NB: if you edit batch and run the tests without committing the changes you've made to batch, this will pass tests but fail when pushed to a PR!). - `test-locally.sh` activates the `hail-ci` conda environment itself because it was not being propagated from the `Makefile`. I don't know why, but this is a simple fix. - `test-locally.sh` starts the ci after the repository is created. CI will print error messages if a watched repository doesn't exist. - `test/test-ci.py` now uses access tokens for all interaction with GitHub, previously it relied on the latent privileges that I and Cotton had in our environments. - `test/test-ci.py` uses a temporary, but not automatically deleted, directory when the environment variable `IN_CLUSTER` is set to `true` (to which it is set by `test-in-cluster.sh`).

The new `hailtop/ssl.py`; module defines the mapping from configuration to Python's; [`SSLContext`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext). There is also one ""curl"" principal: the admin-pod. REQUIRED and DISABLED are; mostly the same because required passes the `insecure` flag. As curl is; client-only, there is no notion of ""incoming connection"". ---. FAQ. Does this recreate certs on each deploy?. Yes. How do services speak to each other while a deploy is happening? Newly deployed; services will only trust newly deployed clients?. `create_certs.py` includes the previous deploy's certificates in the trust; chain, so we can always accept clients from one deploy backwards. Old services; will not trust the new clients, but the `build.yaml` ensures things are deployed; in dependency order. Deploy would never work if a client could depend on; a not-yet-deployed server. ---. Things for you to verify:; - does every service load *its own unqiue* ssl-config secret?; - does every service use an SSL context for serving?; - does everyone who makes http requests to internal services use an SSL client; session?; - do all TLS-secured nginx instances include their http.conf in the `http`; section and the `proxy.conf` file in any proxying sections?; - Do the SSLContext's from `ssl.py` and the nginx configurations generated by; `create_certs.py` obey the aforementioned matrix",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8513:5366,deploy,deploy,5366,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8513,1,['deploy'],['deploy']

This is probably a place to double check before merging. **Job State Changes:**; - We now support a new state ""Creating"" which represents an instance has been spun up for a job, but it has not been activated yet; - The SQL user resources table and cancellable resources table needed to be changed to add the n_creating_jobs, n_cancellable_creating_jobs, and the n_cancelled_creating_jobs; - Added a new SQL function `mark_job_creating` that is only called by the job private instance creator.; - A lot of the existing SQL functions had to change to account for the fact that an instance in the pending state can have job-specific operations done such as mark_job_complete if the job is cancelled. In addition, the ""Creating"" state is like ""Running"" for some operations in that an attempt has been created and actions are happening on behalf of the user. **Driver Changes:**; - New cancel_creating_jobs event; - Two separate methods to get the pools or job private UI pages and two separate configuration methods. One each for pool and job-private. **JobPrivateInstanceCollection:**; - Has two new loops: an instance creation loop and a scheduling loop; - The instance creation loop does a fair share calculation that is almost identical to the pool one except the resource being allocated is n_ready_jobs compared to total_jobs rather than ready_cores_mcpu. ; - The instance creation loop needs to extract the machine_type, storage_gib, and preemptible from the spec without hitting GCS. Therefore, it is stored in the ""spec"" field in the database which required changing the batch format version a bit.; - We avoid double scheduling by requiring that there are no live instances assigned to attempts for that job before creating an instance.; - We mark a job as creating after creating the instance for the new attempt; - The number of instances that can be created is similar to the pool control loop.

The second, `hailgenetics/genetics`, contains a slew of genetics tools that were used by the CCG Workshop. There is no R in any of these images. That is intentional. The image push step is scoped to deploy (but I tested it in my dev environment), so it only runs on deploy. Ergo, we should only update the image during deploy.

Deployability,"cc: @cseed, this explains some weirdness with docker caches. The Docker docs are [misleading at best wrt `--cache-from`](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/32612). `--cache-from X` means treat `X`'s layers as a cache source *and do not use the local cache*. This is a crucial misfeature for two reasons. First, you [must explicitly specify every image that may have useful cache layers](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/33002). Second, you cannot include in the cache untagged local images. The latter is particularly an issue for local developers who might run docker builds that fail half-way through. The first issue is not relevant to us because we don't share many layers between images. The second issue is addressed with Makefile conditions that provide a different experience for local versus CI users.

Deployability,"cc: @danking . Here is the first major database migration. The goal is to add all attempt resources into the database for any attempt with batch format version less than 3. The node configuration was the same for all attempts back then with standard instances, 16 cores, and a 100GB boot disk. I figured out what the quantity for each resource should be by looking at how we compute quantities for resources in `batch/batch/resources.py`. I checked the inserted quantities are identical to the attempts that already exist in the database right after we converted the billing over to using resources. Once we have all resources for all attempts, the next step (future PR) is to do a scan and repopulate the new aggregated billing tables **by date**. In this PR, I don't try and add the usage to the existing `aggregated_*_resources` tables. I did this to cut down on time and space since we're eventually going to deprecate those tables anyways. Because I don't touch those tables, we don't need to worry about modifying the client code and how the current billing information is calculated. How this migration works is there are 5 phases:; 1. Compute the expected number of attempts to process for format version < 3. ; 2. Divide the search space into chunks of size 100 attempts (empirically determined this was the best chunk size) and randomize the order of the chunks.; 3. Serially process 5000 chunks with only 10 out of the 100 records as a ""burn in period"" to avoid the birthday problem when trying to insert records in parallel.; 4. In parallel, process all the chunks with 10 way parallelism (empirically determined to max CPU for a 4 core db instance); 5. Do an audit of the results to make sure the attempt resources now has the correct number of rows and the billing is within $0.001 per job with the old way and new way of computing the billing. The tolerance of $0.001 was empirically determined. At a threshold of $0.0001, 33/30,000,000 attempts failed. I think this is good enough as t",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11990:182,configurat,configuration,182,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11990,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Since my mind was already thinking about CI to address other issues, I thought it prudent to implement this longstanding request. The key idea is that each batch now has a target sha, source sha, and an attempt id. When we refresh state from batch, we look for the oldest batch with the newest attempt_id. We increment attempt_id whenever we `_start_build` on a batch. If the source sha changes, we set the attempt id to zero. It will be incremented to one the next time we build. In this manner, we prevent CI from refreshing from batch and blowing away a retried batch even though it has a higher batch id (and we always prefer lower ids). Retry is implemented in the standard a PR is noted as needing a retry and the watched branch is informed that its state has changed. The heal method of a PR checks for the retry flag, cancels any existing batch, and triggers a new build.

The option options are pretty self-explanatory. - To access an argument to a group (like `dataproc --beta`) in a (sub)command, use the decorator `click.pass_context` to pass the click context which allows you to access parent group parameters. `dataproc start` is an example:. ```; @dataproc.command(; help=""Start a Dataproc cluster configured for Hail.""); @click.argument('cluster_name'); ...; @click.pass_context; def start(ctx, cluster_name, ...):; beta = ctx.parent.params['beta']; ```.

I include the; one-deploy-ago certificates in the trust chains, but once incoming trust is; fixed, I am unsure how to smoothly upgrade services. I probably need to notify; old services to refresh their certificates after the secrets are updated. ### Incoming Trust. Mutual TLS (mTLS) refers to TLS connections wherein both sides are; authenticated. This is rare on the web. In our system, it means verifying that a; request made to you carries a certificate in the `NAME-incoming.pem` file. I; cannot enable that in this PR because the three unmanaged services,; router-resolver, internal-gateway, and gateway, do not currently have; certificates. As a result, all the services in the PR namespace reject the; requests from the unmangaed services. In particular, batch pods cannot; communicate with batch-driver. After this PR is deployed and the unmanaged services have certificates, I can; enable mutual TLS. I've marked the tow lines that need to change with `# FIXME:; mTLS`. ### Batch Confused Deputy. The [confused deputy; problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem) is a classic; in computer security. It refers to a situation with two parties: the deputy and; the attacker. The deputy has authority that the attacker does not. For example,; the deputy can arrest people. A *confused deputy* is one which has been tricked; by the attacker into misusing its authority. In master, Batch has a confused deputy problem: it issues a callback in response; to a batch finishing. That callback is issued from within the cluster and; therefore can name many of our services which are not exposed to the; internet. With the introduction of TLS everywhere, a confused deputy callback; will fail because the victim will not receive a valid Batch certificate (batch; purposely does not send certificates with the callbacks).

This is what we have in the current pull request. Initial view / first page ready in ~10ms, DOMContentLoaded in ~60-120ms (excluding network latency). ## Why not static/HTML web?; In practice: there is no such thing. Even document-centric sites often need dynamic templates, and will therefore use PHP, Python, NodeJS, Go, Rust, etc. These only work on a server, and only serve interpolated, static documents. Any interactive elements require Javascript. As soon as you need Javascript, the choice becomes Vanilla JS, JQuery, or something more structured. Vanilla JS requires a lot of boilerplate (verbose event binding, DOM modification, needs polyfills since browser incompatibilities). JQuery makes this easier, but is 1) very slow, 2) provides no structure. Vanilla JS and JQuery tend to devolve to soup of global state-modifying code, with a lot of time spent on figuring out how to update values in DOM elements. . React/Next make DOM modification declarative, and very very easy. They provide a great deal of structure (especially with Next handling tooling), and thanks to the virtual dom / reconciliation process, performs, in many cases, much faster than directly modifying the DOM (HTML) (i.e plain JS). React also handles necessities like properly escaping all inputs, for XSS attack prevention. All of this in a bundle size that isn't significantly bigger than JQuery, without all of those benefits (and React is rapidly shrinking). It's possible to avoid Javascript. One can simulate interactivity by issuing a server GET request for a new page, i.e click on a link with a GET variable ?someVar=val and get a new page.

It might be good to look for VM deletion events to remove instances that are no longer present and then do a deep delete as then we'll have some redundancy and faster response times.; - Figure out how to do a deep-delete as much as possible for VMs when using the create VM REST API. This is essential for cleaning up resources for idled out workers when the driver is down for a long period of time.; - User billing based on resources used based on the `AzureInstanceConfig`; - Spot billing strategy; - Check network IP settings in the worker; - Add garbage collection CLI commands to build.yaml to clean up VMs, disks, nics, public ip addresses, and network security groups based on a tag; - Fix batch tests to be cloud agnostic. ## Infrastructure. - Create a shared SSH public key on the VMs for development purposes; - Consider having every PR / namespace deploy resources in a separate resource group rather than having one resource group for all Batch resources! We'd need something to name the resource groups something like `hail-dev_jigold` and `jigold_jigold` for example to handle the case where we have two k8s clusters running in our subscription.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10970:2793,deploy,deploy,2793,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10970,1,['deploy'],['deploy']
