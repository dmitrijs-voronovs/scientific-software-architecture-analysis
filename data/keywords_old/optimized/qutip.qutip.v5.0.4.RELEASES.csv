Availability,"# QuTiP 5.0.0 . QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``,; ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations,; and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used; consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been; substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to; represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer; and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced.; In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators``; specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have; had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to; easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know.; A notebook to help with migration is available on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18TcuHNQifYSHdGey7otK8IPDB1YbDZpW?usp=sharing). .

Availability,"This minor release adds support for numpy 1.22 and Python 3.10 and removes some blockers for running QuTiP on the Apple M1. The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes. Improvements; ------------; - The ``enr_destroy`` function was made ~200x faster in many simple cases.

Deployability,"**This is a pre-release.**. QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``, ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations, and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``. Other members of the QuTiP Admin team have been heavily involved in reviewing, testing and designing QuTiP 5:. - Alexander Pitchford; - Asier Galicia; - Nathan Shammah; - Shahnawaz Ahmed; - Neill Lambert; - Simon Cross.

Deployability,"This minor release adds support for numpy 1.22 and Python 3.10 and removes some blockers for running QuTiP on the Apple M1. The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes. Improvements; ------------; - The ``enr_destroy`` function was made ~200x faster in many simple cases.

Deployability,"This release brings improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible. (by **Boxi Li**); - **MAJOR** Improved qubit circuit simulators, including OpenQASM support and performance optimisations. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits.

Deployability,"This release sees the addition of two new solvers -- `qutip.krylovsolve` based on the Krylov subspace approximation and `qutip.nonmarkov.heom` that reimplements the BoFiN HEOM solver. Bloch sphere rendering gained support for drawing arcs and lines on the sphere, and for setting the transparency of rendered points and vectors, Hinton plots gained support for specifying a coloring style, and matrix histograms gained better default colors and more flexible styling options. Other significant improvements include better scaling of the Floquet solver, support for passing `Path` objects when saving and loading files, support for passing callable functions as `e_ops` to `mesolve` and `sesolve`, and faster state number enumeration and Husimi Q functions. Import bugfixes include some bugs affecting plotting with matplotlib 3.5 and fixing support for qutrits (and other non-qubit) quantum circuits. The many other small improvements, bug fixes, documentation enhancements, and behind the scenese development changes are included in the list below. QuTiP 4.7.X will be the last series of releases for QuTiP 4. Patch releases will continue for the 4.7.X series but the main development effort will move to QuTiP 5. The many, many contributors who filed issues, submitted or reviewed pull requests, and improved the documentation for this release are listed next to their contributions below.

Deployability,"or storing time-dependent quantum objects has been significantly expanded, standardized and extended. The time-dependent coefficients are now represented using a new ``Coefficient`` type that may be independently created and manipulated if required. Some highlights:. - The ``.compile()`` method has been removed. Coefficients specified as strings are automatically compiled if possible and the compilation is cached across different Python runs and instances.; - Mixing coefficient types within a single ``Qobj`` is now supported.; - Many new attributes were added to ``QobjEvo`` for convenience. Examples include ``.dims``, ``.shape``, ``.superrep`` and ``.isconstant``.; - Many old attributes such as ``.cte``, ``.use_cython``, ``.type``, ``.const``, and ``.coeff_file`` were removed.; - A new ``Spline`` coefficient supports spline interpolations of different orders. The old ``Cubic_Spline`` coefficient has been removed.; - The new ``.arguments(...)`` method allows additional arguments to the underlying coefficient functions to be updated.; - The ``_step_func_coeff`` argument has been replaced by the ``order`` parameter. ``_step_func_coeff=False`` is equivalent to ``order=3``. ``_step_func_coeff=True`` is equivalent to ``order=0``. Higher values of ``order`` gives spline interpolations of higher orders. Solver changes; --------------. The solvers in QuTiP have been heavily reworked and standardized. Under the hood solvers now make use of swappable ODE ``Integrators``. Many ``Integrators`` are included (see the list below) and custom implementations are possible. Solvers now consistently accept a ``QobjEvo`` instance at the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian, or any object which can be passed to the ``QobjEvo`` constructor. A breakdown of highlights follows. All solvers:. - Solver options are now supplied in an ordinary Python dict. ``qutip.Options`` is deprecated and returns a dict for backwards compatibility.; - A specific ODE integrator may be selected by supplying a ``method`` op",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1:6784,update,updated,6784,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1,1,['update'],['updated']

Creating an instance of the class allows a solver to be run multiple times for the same system without having to repeatedly reconstruct the right-hand side of the ODE to be integrated.; - A ``QobjEvo`` instance is accepted for most operators, e.g., ``H``, ``c_ops``, ``e_ops``, ``a_ops``.; - The progress bar is now selected using the ``progress_bar`` option. A new progess bar using the ``tqdm`` Python library is provided.; - Dynamic arguments, where the value of an operator depends on the current state of the evolution, have been removed. They may be re-implemented later if there is demand for them. Integrators:. - The SciPy zvode integrator is available with the BDF and Adams methods as ``bdf`` and ``adams``.; - The SciPy dop853 integrator (an eighth order Runge-Kutta method by Dormand & Prince) is available as ``dop853``.; - The SciPy lsoda integrator is available as ``lsoda``.; - QuTiP's own implementation of Verner's ""most efficient"" Runge-Kutta methods of order 7 and 9 are available as ``vern7`` and ``vern9``.

Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible.

(by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits.

Energy Efficiency," improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration.

Energy Efficiency," was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes. Improvements; ------------; - The ``enr_destroy`` function was made ~200x faster in many simple cases. ([#1593](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1593) by Johannes Feist); - The ``state_number_enumerate`` function was made significantly faster. ([#1594](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1594) by Johannes Feist); - Added the missing drift Hamiltonian to the method run_analytically of ``Processor``. ([#1603](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1603) Boxi Li); - The ``hadamard_transform`` was made much faster, e.g., ~70x faster for N=10. ([#1688](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1688) by Asier Galicia); - Added support for computing the power of a scalar-like Qobj. ([#1692](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1692) by Asier Galicia); - Removed the ``hardware_info`` module. This module wasn't used inside QuTiP and regularly broke when new operating systems were released, and in particular prevented importing QuTiP on the Apple M1. ([#1754](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1754), [#1758](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1758) by Eric Giguère). Bug Fixes; ---------; - Fixed support for calculating the propagator of a density matrix with collapse operators. QuTiP 4.6.2 introduced extra sanity checks on the dimensions of inputs to mesolve (Fix mesolve segfault with bad initial state [#1459](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1459)), but the propagator function's calls to mesolve violated these checks by supplying initial states with the dimensions incorrectly set. ``propagator`` now calls mesolve with the correct dimensions set on the initial state.

All solvers:. - Solver options are now supplied in an ordinary Python dict. ``qutip.Options`` is deprecated and returns a dict for backwards compatibility.; - A specific ODE integrator may be selected by supplying a ``method`` option.; - Each solver provides a class interface. Creating an instance of the class allows a solver to be run multiple times for the same system without having to repeatedly reconstruct the right-hand side of the ODE to be integrated.; - A ``QobjEvo`` instance is accepted for most operators, e.g., ``H``, ``c_ops``, ``e_ops``, ``a_ops``.; - The progress bar is now selected using the ``progress_bar`` option. A new progess bar using the ``tqdm`` Python library is provided.; - Dynamic arguments, where the value of an operator depends on the current state of the evolution, have been removed. They may be re-implemented later if there is demand for them. Integrators:. - The SciPy zvode integrator is available with the BDF and Adams methods as ``bdf`` and ``adams``.; - The SciPy dop853 integrator (an eighth order Runge-Kutta method by Dormand & Prince) is available as ``dop853``.; - The SciPy lsoda integrator is available as ``lsoda``.; - QuTiP's own implementation of Verner's ""most efficient"" Runge-Kutta methods of order 7 and 9 are available as ``vern7`` and ``vern9``. See http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/ for a description of the methods.; - QuTiP's own implementation of a solver that directly diagonalizes the the system to be integrated is available as ``diag``.

Integrability,"This release brings improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible.

(by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits.

Higher values of ``order`` gives spline interpolations of higher orders. Solver changes; --------------. The solvers in QuTiP have been heavily reworked and standardized. Under the hood solvers now make use of swappable ODE ``Integrators``. Many ``Integrators`` are included (see the list below) and custom implementations are possible.

Integrability,"p``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible. (by **Boxi Li**); - **MAJOR** Improved qubit circuit simulators, including OpenQASM support and performance optimisations. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits.

Modifiability,"This release brings improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too. If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied. Improvements; ------------; - **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**); - **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates. This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible. (by **Boxi Li**); - **MAJOR** Improved qubit circuit simulators, including OpenQASM support and performance optimisations. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**); - **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**); - Add support for Numpy 1.20. QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy. Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.; - Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**); - Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**); - Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**); - Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits.

Modifiability,"This release sees the addition of two new solvers -- `qutip.krylovsolve` based on the Krylov subspace approximation and `qutip.nonmarkov.heom` that reimplements the BoFiN HEOM solver. Bloch sphere rendering gained support for drawing arcs and lines on the sphere, and for setting the transparency of rendered points and vectors, Hinton plots gained support for specifying a coloring style, and matrix histograms gained better default colors and more flexible styling options. Other significant improvements include better scaling of the Floquet solver, support for passing `Path` objects when saving and loading files, support for passing callable functions as `e_ops` to `mesolve` and `sesolve`, and faster state number enumeration and Husimi Q functions. Import bugfixes include some bugs affecting plotting with matplotlib 3.5 and fixing support for qutrits (and other non-qubit) quantum circuits. The many other small improvements, bug fixes, documentation enhancements, and behind the scenese development changes are included in the list below. QuTiP 4.7.X will be the last series of releases for QuTiP 4. Patch releases will continue for the 4.7.X series but the main development effort will move to QuTiP 5. The many, many contributors who filed issues, submitted or reviewed pull requests, and improved the documentation for this release are listed next to their contributions below. Thank you to all of you. # Improvements. - **MAJOR** Added krylovsolve as a new solver based on krylov subspace approximation. ([#1739](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1739) by Emiliano Fortes); - **MAJOR** Imported BoFiN HEOM (https://github.com/tehruhn/bofin/) into QuTiP and replaced the HEOM solver with a compatibility wrapper around BoFiN bosonic solver.

Some widely useful gates have been retained in ``qutip.gates``.; - ``qutip.control`` has been moved to qutip-qtrl and once installed qutip-qtrl is available as either ``qutip.control`` or ``qutip_qtrl``. Note that ``quitp_qtrl`` is provided primarily for backwards compatibility. Improvements to optimal control will take place in the new ``qutip_qoc`` package.; - ``qutip.lattice`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-lattice. It is available from `<https://github.com/qutip/qutip-lattice>`.; - ``qutip.sparse`` has been removed. It contained the old sparse matrix representation and is replaced by the new implementation in ``qutip.data``.; - ``qutip.piqs`` functions are no longer available from the ``qutip`` namespace. They are accessible from ``qutip.piqs`` instead. ## Miscellaneous. - Support has been added for 64-bit integer sparse matrix indices, allowing; sparse matrices with up to 2**63 rows and columns. This support needs to; be enabled at compilation time by calling ``setup.py`` and passing; ``--with-idxint-64``. ### Feature removals. - Support for OpenMP has been removed. If there is enough demand and a good plan for how to organize it, OpenMP support may return in a future QuTiP release.; - The ``qutip.parfor`` function has been removed. Use ``qutip.parallel_map`` instead.; - ``qutip.graph`` has been removed and replaced by SciPy's graph functions.; - ``qutip.topology`` has been removed.

Performance,"This minor release adds support for numpy 1.22 and Python 3.10 and removes some blockers for running QuTiP on the Apple M1. The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes. Improvements; ------------; - The ``enr_destroy`` function was made ~200x faster in many simple cases. ([#1593](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1593) by Johannes Feist); - The ``state_number_enumerate`` function was made significantly faster.

Performance,"This release sees the addition of two new solvers -- `qutip.krylovsolve` based on the Krylov subspace approximation and `qutip.nonmarkov.heom` that reimplements the BoFiN HEOM solver. Bloch sphere rendering gained support for drawing arcs and lines on the sphere, and for setting the transparency of rendered points and vectors, Hinton plots gained support for specifying a coloring style, and matrix histograms gained better default colors and more flexible styling options. Other significant improvements include better scaling of the Floquet solver, support for passing `Path` objects when saving and loading files, support for passing callable functions as `e_ops` to `mesolve` and `sesolve`, and faster state number enumeration and Husimi Q functions. Import bugfixes include some bugs affecting plotting with matplotlib 3.5 and fixing support for qutrits (and other non-qubit) quantum circuits. The many other small improvements, bug fixes, documentation enhancements, and behind the scenese development changes are included in the list below. QuTiP 4.7.X will be the last series of releases for QuTiP 4. Patch releases will continue for the 4.7.X series but the main development effort will move to QuTiP 5.

Safety," the methods.; - QuTiP's own implementation of a solver that directly diagonalizes the the system to be integrated is available as ``diag``. It only works on time-independent systems and is slow to setup, but once the diagonalization is complete, it generates solutions very quickly.; - QuTiP's own implementatoin of an approximate Krylov subspace integrator is available as ``krylov``. This integrator is only usable with ``sesolve``. Result class:. - A new ``.e_data`` attribute provides expectation values as a dictionary. Unlike ``.expect``, the values are provided in a Python list rather than a numpy array, which better supports non-numeric types.; - The contents of the ``.stats`` attribute changed significantly and is now more consistent across solvers.

A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype`` parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product. ``bar @ ket`` returns a scalar.; - The new ``.contract()`` method will collapse 1D subspaces of the dimensions of the ``Qobj``.; - The new ``.logm()`` method returns the matrix logarithm of an operator.; - The methods ``.set_data``, ``.get_data``, ``.extract_state``, ``.eliminate_states``, ``.evaluate`` and ``.check_isunitary`` have been removed.

Testability,"This minor release adds support for numpy 1.22 and Python 3.10 and removes some blockers for running QuTiP on the Apple M1. The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes. Improvements; ------------; - The ``enr_destroy`` function was made ~200x faster in many simple cases. ([#1593](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1593) by Johannes Feist); - The ``state_number_enumerate`` function was made significantly faster.

Testability,"many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``. Other members of the QuTiP Admin team have been heavily involved in reviewing, testing and designing QuTiP 5:. - Alexander Pitchford; - Asier Galicia; - Nathan Shammah; - Shahnawaz Ahmed; - Neill Lambert; - Simon Cross. Two Google Summer of Code contributors updated the tutorials and benchmarks to QuTiP 5:. - Christian Staufenbiel updated many of the tutorials (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tutorials/).; - Xavier Sproken update the benchmarks (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-benchmark/). Four experimental data layers backends were written either as part of Google Summer of Code or as separate projects. While these are still alpha quality, the helped significantly to test the data layer API:. - ``qutip-tensorflow``: a TensorFlow backend by Asier Galicia (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tensorflow); - ``qutip-cupy``: a CuPy GPU backend by Felipe Bivort Haiek (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-cupy); - ``qutip-tensornetwork``: a TensorNetwork backend by Asier Galicia (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tensornetwork); - ``qutip-jax``: a JAX backend by Eric Giguère (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-jax). We have also had many other contributors, whose specific contributions are detailed below:. - Pieter Eendebak (updated the required SciPy to 1.4+, [#1982](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1982)).; - Pieter Eendebak (reduced import times by setting logger names, [#1981](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1981)); - Xavier Sproken (included C header files in the sour",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1:1844,benchmark,benchmark,1844,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1,1,['benchmark'],['benchmark']

The ``precompute`` option to ``FloquetBasis`` may be used instead. Evolution of State Solver (essovle):. - The function ``essolve`` has been removed. Use the ``diag`` integration method with ``sesolve`` or ``mesolve`` instead. Steady-state solvers (steadystate module):. - The ``method`` parameter and ``solver`` parameters have been separated. Previously they were mixed together in the ``method`` parameter.; - The previous options are now passed as parameters to the steady state solver and mostly passed through to the underlying SciPy functions.; - The logging and statistics have been removed. Correlation functions (correlation module):. - A new ``correlation_3op`` function has been added. It supports ``MESolver`` or ``BRMESolver``.; - The ``correlation``, ``correlation_4op``, and ``correlation_ss`` functions have been removed.; - Support for calculating correlation with ``mcsolve`` has been removed. Propagators (propagator module):. - A class interface, ``qutip.Propagator``, has been added for propagators.; - Propagation of time-dependent systems is now supported using ``QobjEvo``.; - The ``unitary_mode`` and ``parallel`` options have been removed. Correlation spectra (spectrum module):. - The functions ``spectrum_ss`` and ``spectrum_pi`` have been removed and are now internal functions.; - The ``use_pinv`` parameter for ``spectrum`` has been removed and the functionality merged into the ``solver`` parameter. Use ``solver=""pi""`` instead. QuTiP core; ----------.

Usability," and removes some blockers for running QuTiP on the Apple M1. The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes. Improvements; ------------; - The ``enr_destroy`` function was made ~200x faster in many simple cases.

See http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/ for a description of the methods.; - QuTiP's own implementation of a solver that directly diagonalizes the the system to be integrated is available as ``diag``. It only works on time-independent systems and is slow to setup, but once the diagonalization is complete, it generates solutions very quickly.; - QuTiP's own implementatoin of an approximate Krylov subspace integrator is available as ``krylov``. This integrator is only usable with ``sesolve``. Result class:. - A new ``.e_data`` attribute provides expectation values as a dictionary. Unlike ``.expect``, the values are provided in a Python list rather than a numpy array, which better supports non-numeric types.; - The contents of the ``.stats`` attribute changed significantly and is now more consistent across solvers. Monte-Carlo Solver (mcsolve):. - The system, H, may now be a super-operator.; - The ``seed`` parameter now supports supplying numpy ``SeedSequence`` or ``Generator`` types.; - The new ``timeout`` and ``target_tol`` parameters allow the solver to exit early if a timeout or target tolerance is reached.; - The ntraj option no longer supports a list of numbers of trajectories. Instead, just run the solver multiple times and use the class ``MCSolver`` if setting up the solver uses a significant amount of time.; - The ``map_func`` parameter has been replaced by the ``map`` option.

([#1827](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1827) by Simon Cross); - Fixed rendering of vectors on the Bloch sphere when using matplotlib 3.5 and above. ([#1818](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1818) by Simon Cross); - Fixed the displaying of ``Lattice1d`` instances and their unit cells. Previously calling them raised exceptions in simple cases. ([#1819](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1819), [#1697](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1697) and [#1702](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1702) by Simon Cross and Saumya Biswas); - Fixed the displaying of the title for ``hinton`` and ``matrix_histogram`` plots when a title is given. Previously the supplied title was not displayed. ([#1707](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1707) by Vladimir Vargas-Calderón); - Removed an incorrect check on the initial state dimensions in the ``QubitCircuit`` constructor. This allows, for example, the construction of qutrit circuits. ([#1807](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1807) by Boxi Li); - Fixed the checking of ``method`` and ``offset`` parameters in ``coherent`` and ``coherent_dm``. ([#1469](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1469) and [#1741](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1741) by Joseph Fox-Rabinovitz and Simon Cross); - Removed the Hamiltonian saved in the ``sesolve`` solver results.

Usability,"ver is to be used as an arguments:; ``args={""state"": MESolver.StateFeedback(default=rho0)}``. ### Integrators:. - The SciPy zvode integrator is available with the BDF and; Adams methods as ``bdf`` and ``adams``.; - The SciPy dop853 integrator (an eighth order Runge-Kutta method by; Dormand & Prince) is available as ``dop853``.; - The SciPy lsoda integrator is available as ``lsoda``.; - QuTiP's own implementation of Verner's ""most efficient"" Runge-Kutta methods; of order 7 and 9 are available as ``vern7`` and ``vern9``. See; http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/ for a description of the methods.; - QuTiP's own implementation of a solver that directly diagonalizes the; the system to be integrated is available as ``diag``. It only works on; time-independent systems and is slow to setup, but once the diagonalization; is complete, it generates solutions very quickly.; - QuTiP's own implementatoin of an approximate Krylov subspace integrator is; available as ``krylov``. This integrator is only usable with ``sesolve``. ### Result class:. - A new ``.e_data`` attribute provides expectation values as a dictionary.; Unlike ``.expect``, the values are provided in a Python list rather than; a numpy array, which better supports non-numeric types.; - The contents of the ``.stats`` attribute changed significantly and is; now more consistent across solvers. ### Monte-Carlo Solver (mcsolve):. - The system, H, may now be a super-operator.; - The ``seed`` parameter now supports supplying numpy ``SeedSequence`` or; ``Generator`` types.; - The new ``timeout`` and ``target_tol`` parameters allow the solver to exit; early if a timeout or target tolerance is reached.; - The ntraj option no longer supports a list of numbers of trajectories.; Instead, just run the solver multiple times and use the class ``MCSolver``; if setting up the solver uses a significant amount of time.; - The ``map_func`` parameter has been replaced by the ``map`` option.; - A loky based parallel map as been added.; - A m",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0:12155,usab,usable,12155,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0,1,['usab'],['usable']
