A **`TGraphBentErrors`** is a **`TGraph`** with bent, asymmetric error; bars. The various format options to draw a **`TGraphBentErrors`** are; explained in **`TGraphBentErrors::Paint` method. The; `TGraphBentErrors`** is drawn by default with error bars and small; horizontal and vertical lines at the end of the error bars. If option; ""`z`"" or ""`Z`"" is specified, these small lines are not drawn. If the; option ""`X`"" is specified, the errors are not drawn; (the `TGraph::Paint` method equivalent). - if option contains ""`>`"", an arrow is drawn at the end of the; error bars. - if option contains ""`|>`"", a full arrow is drawn at the end of the; error bars. - the size of the arrow is set to 2/3 of the marker size. - if option ""`[]`"" is specified, only the end vertical/horizontal; lines of the error bars are drawn.

Masked Vector Expanding Load and Compressing Store Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for expanding load and compressing store operations. Data selected from a vector according to a mask is stored in consecutive memory addresses (compressed store), and vice-versa (expanding load). These operations effective map to ""if (cond.i) a[j++] = v.i"" and ""if (cond.i) v.i = a[j++]"" patterns, respectively. Note that when the mask starts with '1' bits followed by '0' bits, these operations are identical to :ref:`llvm.masked.store <int_mstore>` and :ref:`llvm.masked.load <int_mload>`. .. _int_expandload:.

Error and Warning Messages; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clear diagnostic messages are important to help users identify and fix issues in; their inputs. Use succinct but correct English prose that gives the user the; context needed to understand what went wrong. Also, to match error message; styles commonly produced by other tools, start the first sentence with a; lower-case letter, and finish the last sentence without a period, if it would; end in one otherwise. Sentences which end with different punctuation, such as; ""did you forget ';'?"", should still do so. For example this is a good error message:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: section header 3 is corrupt. Size is 10 when it should be 20. This is a bad message, since it does not provide useful information and uses the; wrong style:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: Corrupt section header. As with other coding standards, individual projects, such as the Clang Static; Analyzer, may have preexisting styles that do not conform to this. If a; different formatting scheme is used consistently throughout the project, use; that style instead. Otherwise, this standard applies to all LLVM tools,; including clang, clang-tidy, and so on. If the tool or project does not have existing functions to emit warnings or; errors, use the error and warning handlers provided in ``Support/WithColor.h``; to ensure they are printed in the appropriate style, rather than printing to; stderr directly. When using ``report_fatal_error``, follow the same standards for the message as; regular error messages.

This fake compiler executes either; clang or gcc (depending on the platform) to compile your; code and then executes the static analyzer to analyze your code.; This ""poor man's interposition"" works amazingly well in many cases; and falls down in others.

Some functions may only fail for a subset of their inputs, so calls using known; safe inputs can be assumed to succeed. The cantFail functions encapsulate this by wrapping an assertion that their; argument is a success value and, in the case of Expected<T>, unwrapping the; T value:. .. code-block:: c++.

Like the ExitOnError utility, cantFail simplifies control flow. Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments.

In this example, we used the; `cl::OneOrMore`_ modifier to inform the CommandLine library that it is an error; if the user does not specify any ``.o`` files on our command line. Again, this; just reduces the amount of checking we have to do. Collecting options as a set of flags; ------------------------------------. Instead of collecting sets of options in a list, it is also possible to gather; information for enum values in a **bit vector**. The representation used by the; `cl::bits`_ class is an ``unsigned`` integer. An enum value is represented by a; 0/1 in the enum's ordinal value bit position. 1 indicating that the enum was; specified, 0 otherwise. As each specified value is parsed, the resulting enum's; bit is set in the option's bit vector:. .. code-block:: c++. bits |= 1 << (unsigned)enum;. Options that are specified multiple times are redundant. Any instances after; the first are discarded. Reworking the above list example, we could replace `cl::list`_ with `cl::bits`_:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::bits<Opts> OptimizationBits(cl::desc(""Available Optimizations:""),; cl::values(; clEnumVal(dce , ""Dead Code Elimination""),; clEnumVal(instsimplify , ""Instruction Simplification""),; clEnumValN(inlining, ""inline"", ""Procedure Integration""),; clEnumVal(strip , ""Strip Symbols"")));. To test to see if ``instsimplify`` was specified, we can use the ``cl:bits::isSet``; function:. .. code-block:: c++. if (OptimizationBits.isSet(instsimplify)) {; ...; }. It's also possible to get the raw bit vector using the ``cl::bits::getBits``; function:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned bits = OptimizationBits.getBits();. Finally, if external storage is used, then the location specified must be of; **type** ``unsigned``. In all other ways a `cl::bits`_ option is equivalent to a; `cl::list`_ option. .. _additional extra text:.

A.2.5 DWARF Expressions; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. .. note::. This section, and its nested sections, replaces DWARF Version 5 section 2.5; and section 2.6. The new DWARF expression operation extensions are defined as; well as clarifying the extensions to already existing DWARF Version 5; operations. It is based on the text of the existing DWARF Version 5 standard. DWARF expressions describe how to compute a value or specify a location. *The evaluation of a DWARF expression can provide the location of an object, the; value of an array bound, the length of a dynamic string, the desired value; itself, and so on.*. If the evaluation of a DWARF expression does not encounter an error, then it can; either result in a value (see :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-expression-value`) or a; location description (see :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-location-description`). When a; DWARF expression is evaluated, it may be specified whether a value or location; description is required as the result kind. If a result kind is specified, and the result of the evaluation does not match; the specified result kind, then the implicit conversions described in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-memory-location-description-operations` are performed if; valid. Otherwise, the DWARF expression is ill-formed. If the evaluation of a DWARF expression encounters an evaluation error, then the; result is an evaluation error. .. note::. Decided to define the concept of an evaluation error. An alternative is to; introduce an undefined value base type in a similar way to location; descriptions having an undefined location description.

Most notably Windows is not supported until at least 6.02.; 6.00/00 supports only. - Linux 32 bit and 64 bit, i32 and x86-64 and x32 (see below).; - OSX 64 bit on x86-64. More platforms are expected to be available later; the lack of support; stems from Cling and Clang/LLVM not being ported to these platforms yet. To aleviate the pain for Windows users who want to try ROOT 6 we provide; a recipe on how to run ROOT 6 in a VM on Windows. Building ROOT also requires a C++11 compatible compiler, so one needs to either have installed gcc >= 4.8 or Clang >= 3.4. On most lecagy platforms these newer compilers are available via a special install.; See the [build prerequisites](https://root.cern/install/dependencies/) page. Despite that, an additional platform as been added: the [x32; psAPI](https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/), called linuxx32gcc. It is; a regular x86-64 ABI but with shorter pointers (4 bytes instead of 8).; This reduces the addressable memory per process to 4GB - but that is; usally sufficient. The advantages are reduced memory consumption (due to; the smaller pointers) and increased performance compared to 32 bit; applications due to the availability of the 64 bit instructions. The; Clang developers mailing list archive [contains a good; comparison](http://clang-developers.42468.n3.nabble.com/Re-PATCH-add-x32-psABI-support-td4024297.html). To build and run binaries compiled in x32, toolchain support is needed.; That is available in the in binutils (2.22), GCC (4.8), glibc (2.16),; Linux kernel (3.4) and even GDB (7.5). These versions are not available; in regular distributions yet (except for [this beta Gentoo; distro](http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/x32/stage3-amd64-x32-20120605.tar.xz); built in x32); once they are, building and running x86-64 and x32; side-by-side will be possible. ## Build System; ROOT 6.00/00 can be built either using the classic "".",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/doc/v600/index.md:309,avail,available,309,core/doc/v600/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/doc/v600/index.md,2,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"; // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]]. It is an efficient on-disk representation of the state of the; compiler after parsing a set of headers. It can be loaded before starting the; next instance to avoid doing redundant work. At build time, rootcling (ROOT's; dictionary generator) creates such PCH file which is attached at ROOT startup; time. Its major drawback is the fact that if third-party users want to include; their libraries, they have to recompile it every time there is a change. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) in; ROOT files to avoid the potentially expensive call to the interpreter if the; information is not the PCH. For example, ROOT's libGeom and other third-party; code. This is done to circumvent the costly call to `ShowMembers` which will; require parsing. ROOTMAP files reduce parsing for code which is not in the PCH. Consider; `foo::bar` and `S` are defined in `libFoo`'s `Foo.h`:; ```cpp; // Foo.h; namespace foo { struct bar{}; }; struct S{};; ```. ```bash; # libFoo.rootmap; { decls }; namespace foo { }; struct S;; ; [ libFoo.so ]; # List of selected classes; class bar; struct S; ```. ```cpp; // G__Foo.cxx ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:6213,redundant,redundant,6213,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

Availability,"; AsIs mode. This mode requires writing AST matchers; that explicitly traverse or ignore implicit nodes, such as parentheses; surrounding an expression or expressions with cleanups. These implicit; nodes are not always obvious from the syntax of the source code, and so this; mode requires careful consideration and testing to get the desired behavior; from an AST matcher. In addition, because template instantiations are matched in the default mode,; transformations can be accidentally made to template declarations. Finally,; because implicit nodes are matched by default, transformations can be made on; entirely incorrect places in the code.; For these reasons, it is possible to ignore AST nodes which are not spelled; in the source using the IgnoreUnlessSpelledInSource; mode. This is likely to be far less error-prone for users who are not already; very familiar with where implicit nodes appear in the AST.

Availability,"; Module map files are typically named ``module.modulemap`` and live; either alongside the headers they describe or in a parent directory of; the headers they describe. These module maps typically describe all of; the API for the library. However, in some cases, the presence or absence of particular headers; is used to distinguish between the ""public"" and ""private"" APIs of a; particular library. For example, a library may contain the headers; ``Foo.h`` and ``Foo_Private.h``, providing public and private APIs,; respectively. Additionally, ``Foo_Private.h`` may only be available on; some versions of library, and absent in others. One cannot easily; express this with a single module map file in the library:. .. parsed-literal::. module Foo {; header ""Foo.h""; ...; }. module Foo_Private {; header ""Foo_Private.h""; ...; }. because the header ``Foo_Private.h`` won't always be available. The; module map file could be customized based on whether; ``Foo_Private.h`` is available or not, but doing so requires custom; build machinery. Private module map files, which are named ``module.private.modulemap``; (or, for backward compatibility, ``module_private.map``), allow one to; augment the primary module map file with an additional modules. For; example, we would split the module map file above into two module map; files:. .. code-block:: c. /* module.modulemap */; module Foo {; header ""Foo.h""; }. /* module.private.modulemap */; module Foo_Private {; header ""Foo_Private.h""; }. When a ``module.private.modulemap`` file is found alongside a; ``module.modulemap`` file, it is loaded after the ``module.modulemap``; file. In our example library, the ``module.private.modulemap`` file; would be available when ``Foo_Private.h`` is available, making it; easier to split a library's public and private APIs along header; boundaries. When writing a private module as part of a *framework*, it's recommended that:. * Headers for this module are present in the ``PrivateHeaders`` framework; subdirector",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:50621,avail,available,50621,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Another example:; ```; TChain::Add(""/path/to/tree/subdir[0-9]/*.root""); ```; This grabs all the root files in subdirectories that have a name starting with `subdir` and ending with some digit. ### Improved efficiency of TTree friends with indices. `TTreeIndex` and `TChainIndex` classes now implement the `Clone` method such that it does not use the ROOT I/O to clone the; index but just does a copy in memory. Notably, this improves processing efficiency for RDataFrame in multithreaded; execution since the same index must be copied over to all the threads and attached to the current tree for proper; event matching. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen a number of updates since the last release. Specifically, 6.32 includes the following changes:. - A major refactoring of the interface, improving consistency across different parts and improving overall robustness. **Note that this is a breaking change with regard to 6.30!**; - The on-disk format has been updated to release candidate 2. **It will not be possible to read RNTuples written in the previous format anymore.**; - Support has been added for several new field types: `std::unordered_set<T>`, `std::map<K,V>`, `std::unordered_map<K,V>`; - Support has been added for on-disk half-precision (IEEE 754-2008 16-bit) float fields. This can be enabled through `RField<float>::SetHalfPrecision()`. On reading, values of such fields are represented as regular, 32-bit floats.; - A new `RNTupleInspector` utility class has been added, to provide information about the on-disk metadata of an RNTuple.; - A new `RNTupleParallelWriter` class has been added, providing (initial) support for parallel writing of RNTuples.; - A new static method `RFieldBase::Check()` has been added, which produces a support status report of a type with regards to RNTuple I/",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:4543,robust,robustness,4543,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['robust'],['robustness']

These callbacks are used to determine that an operation does or does not work; with a specified type (or types). And in all cases, the third parameter is a; ``LegalAction`` type enum value: ``Promote``, ``Expand``, ``Custom``, or; ``Legal``. ``SparcISelLowering.cpp`` contains examples of all four; ``LegalAction`` values. Promote; ^^^^^^^. For an operation without native support for a given type, the specified type; may be promoted to a larger type that is supported. For example, SPARC does; not support a sign-extending load for Boolean values (``i1`` type), so in; ``SparcISelLowering.cpp`` the third parameter below, ``Promote``, changes; ``i1`` type values to a large type before loading. .. code-block:: c++. setLoadExtAction(ISD::SEXTLOAD, MVT::i1, Promote);. Expand; ^^^^^^. For a type without native support, a value may need to be broken down further,; rather than promoted. For an operation without native support, a combination; of other operations may be used to similar effect. In SPARC, the; floating-point sine and cosine trig operations are supported by expansion to; other operations, as indicated by the third parameter, ``Expand``, to; ``setOperationAction``:. .. code-block:: c++. setOperationAction(ISD::FSIN, MVT::f32, Expand);; setOperationAction(ISD::FCOS, MVT::f32, Expand);. Custom; ^^^^^^. For some operations, simple type promotion or operation expansion may be; insufficient. In some cases, a special intrinsic function must be implemented. For example, a constant value may require special treatment, or an operation; may require spilling and restoring registers in the stack and working with; register allocators. As seen in ``SparcISelLowering.cpp`` code below, to perform a type conversion; from a floating point value to a signed integer, first the; ``setOperationAction`` should be called with ``C",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst:59112,down,down,59112,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,1,['down'],['down']

Therefore we chose to delay destroying the; instance variables to a point at which message sends are clearly disallowed:; the point at which the root class's deallocation routines take over. In most code, the difference is not observable. It can, however, be observed; if an instance variable holds a strong reference to an object whose; deallocation will trigger a side-effect which must be carefully ordered with; respect to the destruction of the super class. Such code violates the design; principle that semantically important behavior should be explicit.

Contradictions in *convergence-before* are possible only between two; nodes that are inside some cycle. The dynamic instances of such nodes; may be interleaved in the same thread, and this interleaving may be; different for different threads. When a thread executes a node ``X`` once and then executes it again,; it must have followed a closed path in the CFG that includes ``X``.; Such a path must pass through the header of at least one cycle --- the; smallest cycle that includes the entire closed path. In a given; thread, two dynamic instances of ``X`` are either separated by the; execution of at least one cycle header, or ``X`` itself is a cycle; header. In reducible cycles (natural loops), each execution of the header is; equivalent to the start of a new iteration of the cycle. But this; analogy breaks down in the presence of explicit constraints on the; converged-with relation, such as those described in :ref:`future; work<convergence-note-convergence>`. Instead, cycle headers should be; treated as implicit *points of convergence* in a maximal; converged-with relation. Consider a sequence of nested cycles ``C1``, ``C2``, ..., ``Ck`` such; that ``C1`` is the outermost cycle and ``Ck`` is the innermost cycle,; with headers ``H1``, ``H2``, ..., ``Hk`` respectively. When a thread; enters the cycle ``Ck``, any of the following is possible:. 1. The thread directly entered cycle ``Ck`` without having executed; any of the headers ``H1`` to ``Hk``. 2. The thread executed some or all of the nested headers one or more; times. The maximal converged-with relation captures the following intuition; about cycles:. 1. When two threads enter a top-level cycle ``C1``, they execute; converged dynamic instances of every node that is a :ref:`child; <cycle-parent-block>` of ``C1``. 2.

There are two kinds of problems that can arise: The **reliability** of M; 's error estimates, and their **statistical interpretation**, assuming; they are accurate. ### Statistical interpretation ###. For discussion of basic concepts, such as the meaning of the elements; of the error matrix, parabolic versus $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors, the; appropriate value for $\mbox{up}$ (see [howto:errordef]), and; setting of exact confidence levels, see (in order of increasing; complexity and completeness):. - *""Interpretation of the Errors on Parameters"",* see Part 3 of this; write-up. - *""Determining the Statistical Significance of Experimental; Results""*@bib-MIN81. - *""Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics""*@bib-EADIE. ### The reliability of M error estimates ###. M always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter; errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they; are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization,; these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the; user. After a $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ or $\mbox{HESSE}$ step, the errors; are usually quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. If no; mitigating adjective is given in the printout of the errors, then at; least M believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a; small chance that M has been fooled. Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been sp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:68664,reliab,reliability,68664,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,2,"['error', 'reliab']","['error', 'reliability']"
Availability,"; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M; is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$. Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level.

Specifically, We will maintain separation between; HSLS-specific code and the rest of Clang as much as possible following patterns; in use in Clang code today (i.e. ParseHLSL.cpp, SemaHLSL.cpp, CGHLSL*.cpp...).; We will use inline checks on language options where the code is simple and; isolated, and prefer HLSL-specific implementation files for any code of; reasonable complexity.

In either of these cases, the Target in LLVM can claim support for atomics of an; appropriate size, and then implement some subset of the operations via libcalls; to a ``__sync_*`` function. Such functions *must* not use locks in their; implementation, because unlike the ``__atomic_*`` routines used by; AtomicExpandPass, these may be mixed-and-matched with native instructions by the; target lowering. Further, these routines do not need to be shared, as they are stateless. So,; there is no issue with having multiple copies included in one binary.

If no; mitigating adjective is given in the printout of the errors, then at; least M believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a; small chance that M has been fooled. Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been specified. - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).\; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parametrized so that individual errors are not; very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit.

The reason is that the code; generator would need to insert a jump table in order to form a CFI-valid; address for assembly functions, but there is no way in general for the; code generator to determine the language of the function. This may be; possible with LTO in the intra-DSO case, but in the cross-DSO case the only; information available is the function declaration. One possible solution; is to add a C wrapper for each assembly function, but these wrappers can; present a significant maintenance burden for heavy users of assembly in; addition to adding runtime overhead. For these reasons, we provide the option of making the jump table non-canonical; with the flag ``-fno-sanitize-cfi-canonical-jump-tables``. When the jump; table is made non-canonical, symbol table entries point directly to the; function body. Any instances of a function's address being taken in C will; be replaced with a jump table address. This scheme does have its own caveats, however. It does end up breaking; function address equality more aggressively than the default behavior,; especially in cross-DSO mode which normally preserves function address; equality entirely. Furthermore, it is occasionally necessary for code not compiled with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall`` to take a function address that is valid; for CFI.

See ""Input/Output"". ### Executing a Script From a Script. You may want to execute a script conditionally inside another script.; To do it you need to call the interpreter and you can do that with; `TROOT::ProcessLine()`. The example; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/cernstaff.C` calls a script to build the root; file if it does not exist:. ``` {.cpp}; void cernstaff() {; if (gSystem->AccessPathName(""cernstaff.root"")) {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".x cernbuild.C"");; }; ```. `ProcessLine` takes a parameter, which is a pointer to an `int` or to; a `TInterpreter::EErrorCode` to let you access the interpreter error; code after an attempt to interpret. This will contain the error; as defined in `enum TInterpreter::EErrorCode` with `TInterpreter::kSuccess` being; the value for a successful execution. ### Executing a Script From the Invocation. Instead if starting ROOT and running a script on the prompt you can also pass; it to ROOT in its invocation:. ```; $ root -l -b 'myCode.C(""some String"", 12)'; ```. The exact kind of quoting depends on your shell; the one shown here works for; bash-like shells. ROOT can evaluate any expression as part of the invocation; another version of; the previous example can be spelled like this:. ```; $ root -l -b -e 'gROOT->ProcessLine("".x myCode.C(\""some String\"", 12)"");'; ```. ## C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting. In the next example, we demonstrate three of the most important; extensions ROOT and Cling make to C++.

Availability,"; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location.

There are two kinds of problems that can arise: The **reliability** of M; 's error estimates, and their **statistical interpretation**, assuming; they are accurate. ### Statistical interpretation ###. For discussion of basic concepts, such as the meaning of the elements; of the error matrix, parabolic versus $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors, the; appropriate value for $\mbox{up}$ (see [howto:errordef]), and; setting of exact confidence levels, see (in order of increasing; complexity and completeness):. - *""Interpretation of the Errors on Parameters"",* see Part 3 of this; write-up. - *""Determining the Statistical Significance of Experimental; Results""*@bib-MIN81. - *""Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics""*@bib-EADIE. ### The reliability of M error estimates ###. M always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter; errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they; are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization,; these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the; user. After a $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ or $\mbox{HESSE}$ step, the errors; are usually quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. If no; mitigating adjective is given in the printout of the errors, then at; least M believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a; small chance that M has been fooled. Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been specified. - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated wi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:68770,error,errors,68770,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['errors']

Lvalue casts. Old versions of GCC permit casting the left-hand side of an assignment to a; different type. Clang produces an error on similar code, e.g.,. lvalue.c:2:3: error: assignment to cast is illegal, lvalue casts are not supported; (int*)addr = val;; ^~~~~~~~~~ ~. To fix this problem, move the cast to the right-hand side. In this; example, one could use:. addr = (float *)val;. Jumps to within __block variable scope. Clang disallows jumps into the scope of a __block; variable. Variables marked with __block require special; runtime initialization. A jump into the scope of a __block; variable bypasses this initialization, leaving the variable's metadata; in an invalid state. Consider the following code fragment:. int fetch_object_state(struct MyObject *c) {; if (!c->active) goto error;. __block int result;; run_specially_somehow(^{ result = c->state; });; return result;. error:; fprintf(stderr, ""error while fetching object state"");; return -1;; }. GCC accepts this code, but it produces code that will usually crash; when result goes out of scope if the jump is taken. (It's; possible for this bug to go undetected because it often won't crash if; the stack is fresh, i.e. still zeroed.) Therefore, Clang rejects this; code with a hard error:. t.c:3:5: error: goto into protected scope; goto error;; ^; t.c:5:15: note: jump bypasses setup of __block variable; __block int result;; ^. The fix is to rewrite the code to not require jumping into a; __block variable's scope, e.g. by limiting that scope:. {; __block int result;; run_specially_somehow(^{ result = c->state; });; return result;; }.

If option contains; ""`|>`"", a full arrow is drawn at the end of the error bars. The size; of the arrow is set to 2/3 of the marker size. The option ""`[]`"" is interesting to superimpose systematic errors on; top of the graph with the statistical errors. When it is specified,; only the end vertical/horizontal lines of the error bars are drawn. To control the size of the lines at the end of the error bars (when; option 1 is chosen) use `SetEndErrorSize(np)`. By default `np=1`; `np`; represents the number of pixels. ``` {.cpp}; gStyle->SetEndErrorSize(np);; ```.

Options to Control Clang Crash Diagnostics; ------------------------------------------. As unbelievable as it may sound, Clang does crash from time to time.; Generally, this only occurs to those living on the `bleeding; edge <https://llvm.org/releases/download.html#svn>`_. Clang goes to great; lengths to assist you in filing a bug report. Specifically, Clang; generates preprocessed source file(s) and associated run script(s) upon; a crash. These files should be attached to a bug report to ease; reproducibility of the failure. Below are the command line options to; control the crash diagnostics. .. option:: -fcrash-diagnostics=<val>. Valid values are:. * ``off`` (Disable auto-generation of preprocessed source files during a clang crash.); * ``compiler`` (Generate diagnostics for compiler crashes (default)); * ``all`` (Generate diagnostics for all tools which support it). .. option:: -fno-crash-diagnostics. Disable auto-generation of preprocessed source files during a clang crash. The -fno-crash-diagnostics flag can be helpful for speeding the process; of generating a delta reduced test case. .. option:: -fcrash-diagnostics-dir=<dir>. Specify where to write the crash diagnostics files; defaults to the; usual location for temporary files. .. envvar:: CLANG_CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS_DIR=<dir>.

For pointer types, these builtins operate in terms of the integer; address of the pointer and return a new pointer of the same type (including; qualifiers such as ``const``) with an adjusted address.; When aligning pointers up or down, the resulting value must be within the same; underlying allocation or one past the end (see C17 6.5.6p8, C++ [expr.add]).; This means that arbitrary integer values stored in pointer-type variables must; not be passed to these builtins.

Target pointers; are characterised by 3 offsets: a field offset, an array offset and a; base offset, along with a descriptor specifying the type the pointer is; supposed to refer to. Array indexing adjusts the array offset, while the; field offset is adjusted when a pointer to a member is created. Casting; an integer to a pointer sets the value of the base offset. As a special; case, null pointers are target pointers with all offsets set to 0.

When Clang compiles C++ code for Windows, it attempts to be compatible with; MSVC. There are multiple dimensions to compatibility. First, Clang attempts to be ABI-compatible, meaning that Clang-compiled code; should be able to link against MSVC-compiled code successfully. However, C++; ABIs are particularly large and complicated, and Clang's support for MSVC's C++; ABI is a work in progress. If you don't require MSVC ABI compatibility or don't; want to use Microsoft's C and C++ runtimes, the mingw32 toolchain might be a; better fit for your project. Second, Clang implements many MSVC language extensions, such as; ``__declspec(dllexport)`` and a handful of pragmas. These are typically; controlled by ``-fms-extensions``. Third, MSVC accepts some C++ code that Clang will typically diagnose as; invalid. When these constructs are present in widely included system headers,; Clang attempts to recover and continue compiling the user's program. Most; parsing and semantic compatibility tweaks are controlled by; ``-fms-compatibility`` and ``-fdelayed-template-parsing``, and they are a work; in progress. Finally, there is :ref:`clang-cl`, a driver program for clang that attempts to; be compatible with MSVC's cl.exe. ABI features; ============. The status of major ABI-impacting C++ features:. * Record layout: :good:`Complete`. We've tested this with a fuzzer and have; fixed all known bugs. * Class inheritance: :good:`Mostly complete`. This covers all of the standard; OO features you would expect: virtual method inheritance, multiple; inheritance, and virtual inheritance. Every so often we uncover a bug where; our tables are incompatible, but this is pretty well in hand. This feature; has also been fuzz tested. * Name mangling: :good:`Ongoing`.

Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=memory`` flag.; The MemorySanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final; executable, so make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final; link step. When linking shared libraries, the MemorySanitizer run-time; is not linked, so ``-Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it; with MemorySanitizer). To get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or; higher. To get meaningful stack traces in error messages add; ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``. To get perfect stack traces you may need; to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail call elimination; (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``). .. code-block:: console. % cat umr.cc; #include <stdio.h>. int main(int argc, char** argv) {; int* a = new int[10];; a[5] = 0;; if (a[argc]); printf(""xx\n"");; return 0;; }. % clang -fsanitize=memory -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O2 umr.cc.

ROOT is a unified software package for the storage, processing, and analysis of ; scientific data: from its acquisition to the final visualization in form of highly ; customizable, publication-ready plots. It is reliable, performant and well supported,; easy to use and obtain, and strives to maximize the quantity and impact of scientific ; results obtained per unit cost, both of human effort and computing resources. ROOT provides a very efficient storage system for data models, ; that demonstrated to scale at the Large Hadron Collider experiments: Exabytes ; of scientific data are written in columnar ROOT format.; ROOT comes with histogramming capabilities in an arbitrary number of ; dimensions, curve fitting, statistical modelling, minimization, to allow; the easy setup of a data analysis system that can query and process the data; interactively or in batch mode, as well as a general parallel processing; framework, RDataFrame, that can considerably speed up an analysis, taking ; full advantage of multi-core and distributed systems. ROOT is performance critical software written in C++ and enables rapid prototyping ; powered by a unique C++ compliant interpreter called Cling. ; Cling also enables performant C++ type introspection which is a building block of automatic ; interoperability with Python. Thanks to PyROOT, leveraging the cppyy technology, ; ROOT offers efficient, on-demand C++/Python interoperability in a uniform cross-language ; execution environment. ROOT fully embraces open-source, it's made with passion by its community,; for the benefit of its community.

TableGen is used by both LLVM, Clang, and MLIR with very different goals.; LLVM uses it as a way to automate the generation of massive amounts of; information regarding instructions, schedules, cores, and architecture; features. Some backends generate output that is consumed by more than one; source file, so they need to be created in a way that makes it is easy for; preprocessor tricks to be used. Some backends can also print C++ code; structures, so that they can be directly included as-is. Clang, on the other hand, uses it mainly for diagnostic messages (errors,; warnings, tips) and attributes, so more on the textual end of the scale. MLIR uses TableGen to define operations, operation dialects, and operation; traits. See the :doc:`TableGen Programmer's Reference <./ProgRef>` for an in-depth; description of TableGen, and the :doc:`TableGen Backend Developer's Guide; <./BackGuide>` for a guide to writing a new backend.

Each section below needs three subsections:; description of its purpose with a list of users, output generated from; generic input, and finally why it needed a new backend (in case there's; something similar). Overall, each backend will take the same TableGen file type and transform into; similar output for different targets/uses. There is an implicit contract between; the TableGen files, the back-ends and their users. For instance, a global contract is that each back-end produces macro-guarded; sections.

Availability,"=========. If clang successfully produces an executable, but that executable doesn't run; right, this is either a bug in the code or a bug in the compiler. The first; thing to check is to make sure it is not using undefined behavior (e.g.; reading a variable before it is defined). In particular, check to see if the; program is clean under various `sanitizers; <https://github.com/google/sanitizers>`_ (e.g. ``clang; -fsanitize=undefined,address``) and `valgrind <http://valgrind.org/>`_. Many; ""LLVM bugs"" that we have chased down ended up being bugs in the program being; compiled, not LLVM. Once you determine that the program itself is not buggy, you should choose; which code generator you wish to compile the program with (e.g. LLC or the JIT); and optionally a series of LLVM passes to run. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you. It will print a message letting you know how to reproduce the; resulting error. The :doc:`OptBisect <OptBisect>` page shows an alternative method for finding; incorrect optimization passes. Incorrect code generation; =========================. Similarly to debugging incorrect compilation by mis-behaving passes, you; can debug incorrect code generation by either LLC or the JIT, using; ``bugpoint``. The process ``bugpoint`` follows in this case is to try to; narrow the code down to a function that is miscompiled by one or the other; method, but since for correctness, the entire program must be run,; ``bugpoint`` will compile the code it deems to not be affected with the C; Backend, and then link in the shared object it generates.

Availability,"===========. Introduction; ============. This document contains information about adding a build configuration and; buildbot-worker to private worker builder to LLVM Buildbot Infrastructure. Buildmasters; ============. There are two buildmasters running. * The main buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/buildbot>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will notify commit authors every time they break; the build.; * The staging buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/staging>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will be completely silent by default when the build; is broken. This buildmaster is reconfigured every two hours with any new; commits from the llvm-zorg repository. In order to remain connected to the main buildmaster (and thus notify; developers of failures), a builbot must:. * Be building a supported configuration. Builders for experimental backends; should generally be attached to staging buildmaster.; * Be able to keep up with new commits to the main branch, or at a minimum; recover to tip of tree within a couple of days of falling behind. Additionally, we encourage all bot owners to point their bots towards the; staging master during maintenance windows, instability troubleshooting, and; such. Roles & Expectations; ====================. Each buildbot has an owner who is the responsible party for addressing problems; which arise with said buildbot. We generally expect the bot owner to be; reasonably responsive. For some bots, the ownership responsibility is split between a ""resource owner""; who provides the underlying machine resource, and a ""configuration owner"" who; maintains the build configuration. Generally, operational responsibility lies; with the ""config owner"". We do expect ""resource owners"" - who are generally; the contact listed in a workers attributes - to proxy requests to the relevant; ""config owner"" in a timely manner. Most issues with a buildbot should be addressed directly with a bot owner; via email.

Availability,"===========; Clang-Repl; ===========. **Clang-Repl** is an interactive C++ interpreter that allows for incremental; compilation. It supports interactive programming for C++ in a; read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) style. It uses Clang as a library to compile the; high level programming language into LLVM IR. Then the LLVM IR is executed by; the LLVM just-in-time (JIT) infrastructure. Clang-Repl is suitable for exploratory programming and in places where time; to insight is important. Clang-Repl is a project inspired by the work in; `Cling <https://github.com/root-project/cling>`_, a LLVM-based C/C++ interpreter; developed by the field of high energy physics and used by the scientific data; analysis framework `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_. Clang-Repl allows to move parts; of Cling upstream, making them useful and available to a broader audience. Clang-Repl Basic Data Flow; ==========================. .. image:: ClangRepl_design.png; :align: center; :alt: ClangRepl design. Clang-Repl data flow can be divided into roughly 8 phases:. 1. Clang-Repl controls the input infrastructure by an interactive prompt or by; an interface allowing the incremental processing of input. 2. Then it sends the input to the underlying incremental facilities in Clang; infrastructure. 3. Clang compiles the input into an AST representation. 4. When required the AST can be further transformed in order to attach specific; behavior. 5. The AST representation is then lowered to LLVM IR. 6. The LLVM IR is the input format for LLVM’s JIT compilation infrastructure.; The tool will instruct the JIT to run specified functions, translating them; into machine code targeting the underlying device architecture (eg. Intel; x86 or NVPTX). 7. The LLVM JIT lowers the LLVM IR to machine code. 8. The machine code is then executed.

Availability,"===========; Vector Predication Roadmap; ==========================. .. contents:: Table of Contents; :depth: 3; :local:. Motivation; ==========. This proposal defines a roadmap towards native vector predication in LLVM,; specifically for vector instructions with a mask and/or an explicit vector; length. LLVM currently has no target-independent means to model predicated; vector instructions for modern SIMD ISAs such as AVX512, ARM SVE, the RISC-V V; extension and NEC SX-Aurora. Only some predicated vector operations, such as; masked loads and stores, are available through intrinsics [MaskedIR]_. The Vector Predication (VP) extensions is a concrete RFC and prototype; implementation to achieve native vector predication in LLVM. The VP prototype; and all related discussions can be found in the VP patch on Phabricator; [VPRFC]_. Roadmap; =======. 1. IR-level VP intrinsics; -------------------------. - There is a consensus on the semantics/instruction set of VP.; - VP intrinsics and attributes are available on IR level.; - TTI has capability flags for VP (``supportsVP()``?,; ``haveActiveVectorLength()``?). Result: VP usable for IR-level vectorizers (LV, VPlan, RegionVectorizer),; potential integration in Clang with builtins. 2. CodeGen support; ------------------. - VP intrinsics translate to first-class SDNodes; (eg ``llvm.vp.fdiv.* -> vp_fdiv``).; - VP legalization (legalize explicit vector length to mask (AVX512), legalize VP; SDNodes to pre-existing ones (SSE, NEON)). Result: Backend development based on VP SDNodes. 3. Lift InstSimplify/InstCombine/DAGCombiner to VP; --------------------------------------------------. - Introduce PredicatedInstruction, PredicatedBinaryOperator, .. helper classes; that match standard vector IR and VP intrinsics.; - Add a matcher context to PatternMatch and context-aware IR Builder APIs.; - Incrementally lift DAGCombiner to work on VP SDNodes as well as on regular; vector instructions.; - Incrementally lift InstCombine/InstSimplify to o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/VectorPredication.rst:1023,avail,available,1023,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/VectorPredication.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/VectorPredication.rst,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached. The analysis manager only provides analysis results for the same IR type as; what the pass runs on. For example, a function pass receives an analysis; manager that only provides function-level analyses. This works for many; passes which work on a fixed scope. However, some passes want to peek up or; down the IR hierarchy. For example, an SCC pass may want to look at function; analyses for the functions inside the SCC. Or it may want to look at some; immutable global analysis. In these cases, the analysis manager can provide a; proxy to an outer or inner level analysis manager. For example, to get a; ``FunctionAnalysisManager`` from a ``CGSCCAnalysisManager``, you can call. .. code-block:: c++. FunctionAnalysisManager &FAM =; AM.getResult<FunctionAnalysisManagerCGSCCProxy>(InitialC, CG); .getManager();. and use ``FAM`` as a typical ``FunctionAnalysisManager`` that a function pass; would have access to. To get access to an outer level IR analysis, you can; call. .. code-block:: c++. const auto &MAMProxy =; AM.getResult<ModuleAnalysisManagerCGSCCProxy>(InitialC, CG);; FooAnalysisResult *AR = MAMProxy.getCachedResult<FooAnalysis>(M);.

The LLVM project and many of the core projects built on LLVM build using CMake.; This document aims to provide a brief overview of CMake for developers modifying; LLVM projects or building their own projects on top of LLVM. The official CMake language references is available in the cmake-language; manpage and `cmake-language online documentation; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/manual/cmake-language.7.html>`_. 10,000 ft View; ==============. CMake is a tool that reads script files in its own language that describe how a; software project builds. As CMake evaluates the scripts it constructs an; internal representation of the software project. Once the scripts have been; fully processed, if there are no errors, CMake will generate build files to; actually build the project. CMake supports generating build files for a variety; of command line build tools as well as for popular IDEs. When a user runs CMake it performs a variety of checks similar to how autoconf; worked historically. During the checks and the evaluation of the build; description scripts CMake caches values into the CMakeCache. This is useful; because it allows the build system to skip long-running checks during; incremental development. CMake caching also has some drawbacks, but that will be; discussed later. Scripting Overview; ==================. CMake's scripting language has a very simple grammar. Every language construct; is a command that matches the pattern _name_(_args_).

TableGen is used by both LLVM, Clang, and MLIR with very different goals.; LLVM uses it as a way to automate the generation of massive amounts of; information regarding instructions, schedules, cores, and architecture; features. Some backends generate output that is consumed by more than one; source file, so they need to be created in a way that makes it is easy for; preprocessor tricks to be used. Some backends can also print C++ code; structures, so that they can be directly included as-is. Clang, on the other hand, uses it mainly for diagnostic messages (errors,; warnings, tips) and attributes, so more on the textual end of the scale. MLIR uses TableGen to define operations, operation dialects, and operation; traits.

TableGen's purpose is to help a human develop and maintain records of; domain-specific information. Because there may be a large number of these; records, it is specifically designed to allow writing flexible descriptions and; for common features of these records to be factored out. This reduces the; amount of duplication in the description, reduces the chance of error, and makes; it easier to structure domain specific information. The TableGen front end parses a file, instantiates the declarations, and; hands the result off to a domain-specific `backend`_ for processing. See; the :doc:`TableGen Programmer's Reference <./ProgRef>` for an in-depth; description of TableGen. See :doc:`tblgen - Description to C++ Code; <../CommandGuide/tblgen>` for details on the ``*-tblgen`` commands; that run the various flavors of TableGen. The current major users of TableGen are :doc:`The LLVM Target-Independent; Code Generator <../CodeGenerator>` and the `Clang diagnostics and attributes; <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-errors-and-warnings>`_. Note that if you work with TableGen frequently and use emacs or vim,; you can find an emacs ""TableGen mode"" and a vim language file in the; ``llvm/utils/emacs`` and ``llvm/utils/vim`` directories of your LLVM; distribution, respectively. .. _intro:.

Availability,"==================; Vectorization Plan; ==================. .. contents::; :local:. Abstract; ========; The vectorization transformation can be rather complicated, involving several; potential alternatives, especially for outer-loops [1]_ but also possibly for; innermost loops. These alternatives may have significant performance impact,; both positive and negative. A cost model is therefore employed to identify the; best alternative, including the alternative of avoiding any transformation; altogether. The Vectorization Plan is an explicit model for describing vectorization; candidates. It serves for both optimizing candidates including estimating their; cost reliably, and for performing their final translation into IR. This; facilitates dealing with multiple vectorization candidates. High-level Design; =================. Vectorization Workflow; ----------------------; VPlan-based vectorization involves three major steps, taking a ""scenario-based; approach"" to vectorization planning:. 1. Legal Step: check if a loop can be legally vectorized; encode constraints and; artifacts if so.; 2. Plan Step:. a. Build initial VPlans following the constraints and decisions taken by; Legal Step 1, and compute their cost.; b. Apply optimizations to the VPlans, possibly forking additional VPlans.; Prune sub-optimal VPlans having relatively high cost.; 3. Execute Step: materialize the best VPlan. Note that this is the only step; that modifies the IR. Design Guidelines; -----------------; In what follows, the term ""input IR"" refers to code that is fed into the; vectorizer whereas the term ""output IR"" refers to code that is generated by the; vectorizer. The output IR contains code that has been vectorized or ""widened""; according to a loop Vectorization Factor (VF), and/or loop unroll-and-jammed; according to an Unroll Factor (UF).; The design of VPlan follows several high-level guidelines:. 1.

FatLTO objects are a special type of `fat object file; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary>`_ that contain LTO compatible IR in; addition to generated object code, instead of containing object code for; multiple target architectures. This allows users to defer the choice of whether; to use LTO or not to link-time, and has been a feature available in other; compilers, like `GCC; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html>`_, for some time. Under FatLTO the compiler can emit standard object files which contain both the; machine code in the ``.text`` section and LLVM bitcode in the ``.llvm.lto``; section. Overview; ========. Within LLVM, FatLTO is supported by choosing the ``FatLTODefaultPipeline``.; This pipeline will:. #) Run the pre-link (Thin)LTO pipeline on the current module.; #) Embed the pre-link bitcode in a special ``.llvm.lto`` section.; #) Finish optimizing the module using the ModuleOptimization pipeline.; #) Emit the object file, including the new ``.llvm.lto`` section. .. NOTE. Previously, we conservatively ran independent pipelines on separate copies; of the LLVM module to generate the bitcode section and the object code,; which happen to be identical to those used outside of FatLTO. While that; resulted in compiled artifacts that were identical to those produced by the; default and (Thin)LTO pipelines, module cloning led to some cases of; miscompilation, and we have moved away from trying to keep bitcode; generation and optimization completely disjoint. Bit-for-bit compatibility is not (and never was) a guarantee, and we reserve; the right to change this at any time.

The interpreter is activated using the following flags:. * ``-fexperimental-new-constant-interpreter`` enables the interpreter,; emitting an error if an unsupported feature is encountered. Bytecode Compilation; ====================. Bytecode compilation is handled in ``ByteCodeStmtGen.h`` for statements; and ``ByteCodeExprGen.h`` for expressions. The compiler has two different; backends: one to generate bytecode for functions (``ByteCodeEmitter``) and; one to directly evaluate expressions as they are compiled, without; generating bytecode (``EvalEmitter``). All functions are compiled to; bytecode, while toplevel expressions used in constant contexts are directly; evaluated since the bytecode would never be reused. This mechanism aims to; pave the way towards replacing the evaluator, improving its performance on; functions and loops, while being just as fast on single-use toplevel; expressions. The interpreter relies on stack-based, strongly-typed opcodes. The glue; logic between the code generator, along with the enumeration and; description of opcodes, can be found in ``Opcodes.td``. The opcodes are; implemented as generic template methods in ``Interp.h`` and instantiated; with the relevant primitive types by the interpreter loop or by the; evaluating emitter.

The LLVM gold plugin implements the gold plugin interface on top of; :ref:`libLTO`. The same plugin can also be used by other tools such as; ``ar`` and ``nm``. Note that ld.bfd from binutils version 2.21.51.0.2; and above also supports LTO via plugins. However, usage of the LLVM; gold plugin with ld.bfd is not tested and therefore not officially; supported or recommended.

Availability,"=====================. A program is in Loop Closed SSA Form if it is in SSA form; and all values that are defined in a loop are used only inside; this loop. Programs written in LLVM IR are always in SSA form but not necessarily; in LCSSA. To achieve the latter, for each value that is live across the; loop boundary, single entry PHI nodes are inserted to each of the exit blocks; [#lcssa-construction]_ in order to ""close"" these values inside the loop.; In particular, consider the following loop:. .. code-block:: C. c = ...;; for (...) {; if (c); X1 = ...; else; X2 = ...; X3 = phi(X1, X2); // X3 defined; }. ... = X3 + 4; // X3 used, i.e. live; // outside the loop. In the inner loop, the X3 is defined inside the loop, but used; outside of it. In Loop Closed SSA form, this would be represented as follows:. .. code-block:: C. c = ...;; for (...) {; if (c); X1 = ...; else; X2 = ...; X3 = phi(X1, X2);; }; X4 = phi(X3);. ... = X4 + 4;.

Availability,"=====================; How To Use Attributes; =====================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. Attributes in LLVM have changed in some fundamental ways. It was necessary to; do this to support expanding the attributes to encompass more than a handful of; attributes --- e.g. command line options. The old way of handling attributes; consisted of representing them as a bit mask of values. This bit mask was; stored in a ""list"" structure that was reference counted. The advantage of this; was that attributes could be manipulated with 'or's and 'and's. The; disadvantage of this was that there was limited room for expansion, and; virtually no support for attribute-value pairs other than alignment. In the new scheme, an ``Attribute`` object represents a single attribute that's; uniqued. You use the ``Attribute::get`` methods to create a new ``Attribute``; object. An attribute can be a single ""enum"" value (the enum being the; ``Attribute::AttrKind`` enum), a string representing a target-dependent; attribute, or an attribute-value pair. Some examples:. * Target-independent: ``noinline``, ``zext``; * Target-dependent: ``""no-sse""``, ``""thumb2""``; * Attribute-value pair: ``""cpu"" = ""cortex-a8""``, ``align = 4``. Note: for an attribute value pair, we expect a target-dependent attribute to; have a string for the value. ``Attribute``; =============; An ``Attribute`` object is designed to be passed around by value. Because attributes are no longer represented as a bit mask, you will need to; convert any code which does treat them as a bit mask to use the new query; methods on the Attribute class. ``AttributeList``; =================. The ``AttributeList`` stores a collection of Attribute objects for each kind of; object that may have an attribute associated with it: the function as a whole,; the return type, or the function's parameters.

Availability,"======================; Control Flow Integrity; ======================. .. toctree::; :hidden:. ControlFlowIntegrityDesign. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. Clang includes an implementation of a number of control flow integrity (CFI); schemes, which are designed to abort the program upon detecting certain forms; of undefined behavior that can potentially allow attackers to subvert the; program's control flow. These schemes have been optimized for performance,; allowing developers to enable them in release builds. To enable Clang's available CFI schemes, use the flag ``-fsanitize=cfi``.; You can also enable a subset of available :ref:`schemes <cfi-schemes>`.; As currently implemented, all schemes rely on link-time optimization (LTO);; so it is required to specify ``-flto``, and the linker used must support LTO,; for example via the `gold plugin`_. To allow the checks to be implemented efficiently, the program must; be structured such that certain object files are compiled with CFI; enabled, and are statically linked into the program. This may preclude; the use of shared libraries in some cases. The compiler will only produce CFI checks for a class if it can infer hidden; LTO visibility for that class. LTO visibility is a property of a class that; is inferred from flags and attributes. For more details, see the documentation; for :doc:`LTO visibility <LTOVisibility>`. The ``-fsanitize=cfi-{vcall,nvcall,derived-cast,unrelated-cast}`` flags; require that a ``-fvisibility=`` flag also be specified.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`dsymutil` links the DWARF debug information found in the object files; for an executable *executable* by using debug symbols information contained in; its symbol table. By default, the linked debug information is placed in a; ``.dSYM`` bundle with the same name as the executable. OPTIONS; -------; .. option:: --accelerator=<accelerator type>. Specify the desired type of accelerator table. Valid options are 'Apple',; 'Dwarf', 'Default' and 'None'. .. option:: --arch <arch>. Link DWARF debug information only for specified CPU architecture types.; Architectures may be specified by name. When using this option, an error will; be returned if any architectures can not be properly linked. This option can; be specified multiple times, once for each desired architecture. All CPU; architectures will be linked by default and any architectures that can't be; properly linked will cause :program:`dsymutil` to return an error. .. option:: --build-variant-suffix <suffix=buildvariant>. Specify the build variant suffix used to build the executable file.; There can be multiple variants for the binary of a product, each built; slightly differently. The most common build variants are 'debug' and; 'profile'. Setting the DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX environment variable will; cause dyld to load the specified variant at runtime. .. option:: --dump-debug-map. Dump the *executable*'s debug-map (the list of the object files containing the; debug information) in YAML format and exit. No DWARF link will take place. .. option:: -D <path>. Specify a directory that contain dSYM files to search for.; This is used for mergeable libraries, so dsymutil knows where to look; for dSYM files with debug information about symbols present in those; libraries. .. option:: --fat64.

Before you start, it is essential to make sure that the meetup is as welcoming; as any other event related to LLVM. Therefore you shall follow LLVM's; `Code of Conduct <https://llvm.org/docs/CodeOfConduct.html>`_. Other than that - your mileage may vary. Please adapt your social to what works; best for your specific situation. General suggestions; -------------------. * We highly recommend that you join the official LLVM meetup organization. In; addition to covering the cost of the meetup, all LLVM meetups are advertised; together and easily found by potential attendees. Please contact; arnaud.degrandmaison@llvm.org for more details.; * Beware of cultural differences: what works well in one region may not work in; other part of the world.; * Do not be alone to organize the meetup. Try to work with a couple other; organizers. This is more motivating as an organizer, and this makes the; meetup more resilient over time.; * Each event can have a different form such as a social event, or; a hackathon/workshop, or a 'mini-conference' with one or more talks. You do; not have to stick to one format forever.; * Whatever format you choose, `LLVM Weekly <http://llvmweekly.org/>`_ is an; excellent topic starter: go through the 3-4 recent LLVM Weekly posts and; prepare a list of the most interesting/notable news and discuss them with the; group. Advertisement; -------------. * Try to advertise via similar meetups/user groups; * Advertise your meetup on the mailing lists (llvm-dev, cfe-dev, lldb-dev,; ...). Feel free to post to all of them, or at least to llvm-dev.; But as these mailing lists have high traffic and some LLVM developers are not; very active on them, you may reach more interested people using the mailing; feature from meetup.com.; * Advertise the meetup on Twitter and mention; `@llvmweekly <http://twitter.com/llvmweekly>`_ and; `@llvmorg <http://twitt",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MeetupGuidelines.rst:1119,resilien,resilient,1119,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MeetupGuidelines.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MeetupGuidelines.rst,1,['resilien'],['resilient']
Availability,"=======================; LLVM Common CMake Utils; =======================. What goes here; --------------. These are CMake modules to be shared between LLVM projects strictly at build; time. In other words, they must not be included from an installed CMake module,; such as the ``Add*.cmake`` ones. Modules that are reachable from installed; modules should instead go in ``${project}/cmake/modules`` of the most upstream; project that uses them. The advantage of not putting these modules in an existing location like; ``llvm/cmake/modules`` is two-fold:. - Since they are not installed, we don't have to worry about any out-of-tree; downstream usage, and thus there is no need for stability. - Since they are available as part of the source at build-time, we don't have; to do the usual stand-alone vs combined-build dances, avoiding much; complexity. How to use; ----------. For tools, please do:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(NOT DEFINED LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS); set(LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../cmake); endif(). # Add path for custom modules.; list(INSERT CMAKE_MODULE_PATH 0; # project-specific module dirs first; ""${LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS}/Modules""; ). Notes:. - The ``if(NOT DEFINED ...)`` guard is there because in combined builds, LLVM; will set this variable. This is useful for legacy builds where projects are; found in ``llvm/tools`` instead. - ``INSERT ... 0`` ensures these new entries are prepended to the front of the; module path, so nothing might shadow them by mistake. For runtime libs, we skip the ``if(NOT DEFINED`` part:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../cmake). ... # same as before.

This proposal defines a roadmap towards native vector predication in LLVM,; specifically for vector instructions with a mask and/or an explicit vector; length. LLVM currently has no target-independent means to model predicated; vector instructions for modern SIMD ISAs such as AVX512, ARM SVE, the RISC-V V; extension and NEC SX-Aurora. Only some predicated vector operations, such as; masked loads and stores, are available through intrinsics [MaskedIR]_. The Vector Predication (VP) extensions is a concrete RFC and prototype; implementation to achieve native vector predication in LLVM. The VP prototype; and all related discussions can be found in the VP patch on Phabricator; [VPRFC]_. Roadmap; =======. 1. IR-level VP intrinsics; -------------------------. - There is a consensus on the semantics/instruction set of VP.; - VP intrinsics and attributes are available on IR level.; - TTI has capability flags for VP (``supportsVP()``?,; ``haveActiveVectorLength()``?). Result: VP usable for IR-level vectorizers (LV, VPlan, RegionVectorizer),; potential integration in Clang with builtins. 2. CodeGen support; ------------------. - VP intrinsics translate to first-class SDNodes; (eg ``llvm.vp.fdiv.* -> vp_fdiv``).; - VP legalization (legalize explicit vector length to mask (AVX512), legalize VP; SDNodes to pre-existing ones (SSE, NEON)). Result: Backend development based on VP SDNodes. 3. Lift InstSimplify/InstCombine/DAGCombiner to VP; --------------------------------------------------. - Introduce PredicatedInstruction, PredicatedBinaryOperator, .. helper classes; that match standard vector IR and VP intrinsics.; - Add a matcher context to PatternMatch and context-aware IR Builder APIs.; - Incrementally lift DAGCombiner to work on VP SDNodes as well as on regular; vector instructions.; - Incrementally lift InstCombine/In",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/VectorPredication.rst:281,mask,mask,281,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/VectorPredication.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/VectorPredication.rst,3,"['avail', 'mask']","['available', 'mask', 'masked']"
Availability,"===========================. The LLVM build system provides a convenient way to build libraries and; executables. Most of your project Makefiles will only need to define a few; variables. Below is a list of the variables one can set and what they can; do:. Required Variables; ------------------. ``LEVEL``. This variable is the relative path from this ``Makefile`` to the top; directory of your project's source code. For example, if your source code; is in ``/tmp/src``, then the ``Makefile`` in ``/tmp/src/jump/high``; would set ``LEVEL`` to ``""../..""``. Variables for Building Subdirectories; -------------------------------------. ``DIRS``. This is a space separated list of subdirectories that should be built. They; will be built, one at a time, in the order specified. ``PARALLEL_DIRS``. This is a list of directories that can be built in parallel. These will be; built after the directories in DIRS have been built. ``OPTIONAL_DIRS``. This is a list of directories that can be built if they exist, but will not; cause an error if they do not exist. They are built serially in the order; in which they are listed. Variables for Building Libraries; --------------------------------. ``LIBRARYNAME``. This variable contains the base name of the library that will be built. For; example, to build a library named ``libsample.a``, ``LIBRARYNAME`` should; be set to ``sample``. ``BUILD_ARCHIVE``. By default, a library is a ``.o`` file that is linked directly into a; program. To build an archive (also known as a static library), set the; ``BUILD_ARCHIVE`` variable. ``SHARED_LIBRARY``. If ``SHARED_LIBRARY`` is defined in your Makefile, a shared (or dynamic); library will be built. Variables for Building Programs; -------------------------------. ``TOOLNAME``. This variable contains the name of the program that will be built. For; example, to build an executable named ``sample``, ``TOOLNAME`` should be set; to ``sample``. ``USEDLIBS``.

Availability,"============================. The implementation of the block frequency calculation analyses each loop,; bottom-up, ignoring backedges; i.e., as a DAG. After each loop is processed,; it's packaged up to act as a pseudo-node in its parent loop's (or the; function's) DAG analysis. Block Mass; ==========. For each DAG, the entry node is assigned a mass of ``UINT64_MAX`` and mass is; distributed to successors according to branch weights. Block Mass uses a; fixed-point representation where ``UINT64_MAX`` represents ``1.0`` and ``0``; represents a number just above ``0.0``. After mass is fully distributed, in any cut of the DAG that separates the exit; nodes from the entry node, the sum of the block masses of the nodes succeeded; by a cut edge should equal ``UINT64_MAX``. In other words, mass is conserved; as it ""falls"" through the DAG. If a function's basic block graph is a DAG, then block masses are valid block; frequencies. This works poorly in practice though, since downstream users rely; on adding block frequencies together without hitting the maximum. Loop Scale; ==========. Loop scale is a metric that indicates how many times a loop iterates per entry.; As mass is distributed through the loop's DAG, the (otherwise ignored) backedge; mass is collected. This backedge mass is used to compute the exit frequency,; and thus the loop scale. Implementation: Getting from mass and scale to frequency; ========================================================. After analysing the complete series of DAGs, each block has a mass (local to; its containing loop, if any), and each loop pseudo-node has a loop scale and; its own mass (from its parent's DAG). We can get an initial frequency assignment (with entry frequency of 1.0) by; multiplying these masses and loop scales together. A given block's frequency; is the product of its mass, the mass of containing loops' pseudo nodes, and the; containing loops' loop scales.

Availability,"=============================; Introduction to the Clang AST; =============================. This document gives a gentle introduction to the mysteries of the Clang; AST. It is targeted at developers who either want to contribute to; Clang, or use tools that work based on Clang's AST, like the AST; matchers. .. raw:: html. <center><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqCkCDFLSsc?vq=hd720"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>. `Slides <https://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-04/klimek-slides.pdf>`_. Introduction; ============. Clang's AST is different from ASTs produced by some other compilers in; that it closely resembles both the written C++ code and the C++; standard. For example, parenthesis expressions and compile time; constants are available in an unreduced form in the AST. This makes; Clang's AST a good fit for refactoring tools. Documentation for all Clang AST nodes is available via the generated; `Doxygen <https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen>`_. The doxygen online; documentation is also indexed by your favorite search engine, which will; make a search for clang and the AST node's class name usually turn up; the doxygen of the class you're looking for (for example, search for:; clang ParenExpr). Examining the AST; =================. A good way to familiarize yourself with the Clang AST is to actually look; at it on some simple example code. Clang has a builtin AST-dump mode,; which can be enabled with the flag ``-ast-dump``. Let's look at a simple example AST:. ::. $ cat test.cc; int f(int x) {; int result = (x / 42);; return result;; }. # Clang by default is a frontend for many tools; -Xclang is used to pass; # options directly to the C++ frontend.; $ clang -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only test.cc; TranslationUnitDecl 0x5aea0d0 <<invalid sloc>>; ... cutting out internal declarations of clang ...; `-FunctionDecl 0x5aeab50 <test.cc:1:1, line:4:1> f 'int (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl 0x5aeaa90 <line:1:7, col:11> x 'int'; `-CompoundStmt 0x5ae",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.rst:782,avail,available,782,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.rst,2,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"=============================; LLVM Community Support Policy; =============================. As a compilation infrastructure, LLVM has multiple types of users, both; downstream and upstream, of many combinations of its projects, tools and; libraries. There is a core part of it that encompass the implementation of the compiler; (front/middle/back ends), run-time libraries (RT, C++, OpenMP, etc) and; associated tools (debugger, linker, object file manipulation, etc). These; components are present in the public release on our supported architectures; and operating systems and the whole community must maintain and care about. There are, however, other components within the main repository that either; cater to a specific sub-community of LLVM (upstream or downstream) or; help parts of the community to integrate LLVM into their own development tools; or external projects. Those parts of the main repository don't always have; rigorous testing like the core parts, nor are they validated and shipped with; our public upstream releases. Even not being a core part of the project, we have enough sub-communities; needing those changes with enough overlap that having them in the main; repository is beneficial to minimise the repetition of those changes in all; the external repositories that need them. But the maintenance costs of such diverse ecosystem is non trivial, so we divide; the level of support in two tiers: core and peripheral, with two; different levels of impact and responsibilities. Those tiers refer only to the; main repository (``llvm-project``) and not the other repositories in our git; project, unless explicitly stated. Regardless of the tier, all code must follow the existing policies on quality,; reviews, style, etc. Core Tier; =========. The core tier encompasses all of the code in the main repository that is; in production, is actively tested and released in a regular schedule, including; core LLVM APIs and infrastructure, front/middle/back-ends, run-time libra",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst:166,down,downstream,166,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst,2,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"==============================; Convergent Operation Semantics; ==============================. .. contents::; :local:; :depth: 4. Overview; ========. Some parallel execution environments execute threads in groups that allow; efficient communication within the group using special primitives called; *convergent* operations. The outcome of a convergent operation is sensitive to; the set of threads that executes it ""together"", i.e., convergently. When control; flow :ref:`diverges <convergence-and-uniformity>`, i.e. threads of the same; group follow different; paths through the CFG, not all threads of the group may be available to; participate in this communication. This is the defining characteristic that; distinguishes convergent operations from other inter-thread communication:. A convergent operation involves inter-thread communication or synchronization; that occurs outside of the memory model, where the set of threads which; participate in communication is implicitly affected by control flow. For example, in the following GPU compute kernel, communication during the; convergent operation is expected to occur precisely among those threads of an; implementation-defined execution scope (such as workgroup or subgroup) for; which ``condition`` is true:. .. code-block:: c++. void example_kernel() {; ...; if (condition); convergent_operation();; ...; }. In structured programming languages, there is often an intuitive and; unambiguous way of determining the threads that are expected to communicate.; However, this is not always the case even in structured programming languages,; and the intuition breaks down entirely in unstructured control flow. This; document describes the formal semantics in LLVM, i.e. how to determine the set; of communicating threads for convergent operations. The definitions in this document leave many details open, such as how groups of; threads are formed in the first place. It focuses on the questions that are; relevant for deciding the correctness",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst:622,avail,available,622,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"==============================; FaultMaps and implicit checks; ==============================. .. contents::; :local:; :depth: 2. Motivation; ==========. Code generated by managed language runtimes tend to have checks that; are required for safety but never fail in practice. In such cases, it; is profitable to make the non-failing case cheaper even if it makes; the failing case significantly more expensive. This asymmetry can be; exploited by folding such safety checks into operations that can be; made to fault reliably if the check would have failed, and recovering; from such a fault by using a signal handler. For example, Java requires null checks on objects before they are read; from or written to. If the object is ``null`` then a; ``NullPointerException`` has to be thrown, interrupting normal; execution. In practice, however, dereferencing a ``null`` pointer is; extremely rare in well-behaved Java programs, and typically the null; check can be folded into a nearby memory operation that operates on; the same memory location. The Fault Map Section; =====================. Information about implicit checks generated by LLVM are put in a; special ""fault map"" section. On Darwin this section is named; ``__llvm_faultmaps``. The format of this section is. .. code-block:: none. Header {; uint8 : Fault Map Version (current version is 1); uint8 : Reserved (expected to be 0); uint16 : Reserved (expected to be 0); }; uint32 : NumFunctions; FunctionInfo[NumFunctions] {; uint64 : FunctionAddress; uint32 : NumFaultingPCs; uint32 : Reserved (expected to be 0); FunctionFaultInfo[NumFaultingPCs] {; uint32 : FaultKind; uint32 : FaultingPCOffset; uint32 : HandlerPCOffset; }; }. FailtKind describes the reason of expected fault. Currently three kind; of faults are supported:. 1. ``FaultMaps::FaultingLoad`` - fault due to load from memory.; 2. ``FaultMaps::FaultingLoadStore`` - fault due to instruction load and store.; 3. ``FaultMaps::FaultingStore`` - fault due to store to memory.

Availability,"===============================; How To Use Instruction Mappings; ===============================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. This document contains information about adding instruction mapping support; for a target. The motivation behind this feature comes from the need to switch; between different instruction formats during various optimizations. One approach; could be to use switch cases which list all the instructions along with formats; they can transition to. However, it has large maintenance overhead; because of the hardcoded instruction names. Also, whenever a new instruction is; added in the .td files, all the relevant switch cases should be modified; accordingly. Instead, the same functionality could be achieved with TableGen and; some support from the .td files for a fraction of maintenance cost. ``InstrMapping`` Class Overview; ===============================. TableGen uses relationship models to map instructions with each other. These; models are described using ``InstrMapping`` class as a base. Each model sets; various fields of the ``InstrMapping`` class such that they can uniquely; describe all the instructions using that model. TableGen parses all the relation; models and uses the information to construct relation tables which relate; instructions with each other. These tables are emitted in the; ``XXXInstrInfo.inc`` file along with the functions to query them. Following; is the definition of ``InstrMapping`` class defined in Target.td file:. .. code-block:: text. class InstrMapping {; // Used to reduce search space only to the instructions using this; // relation model.; string FilterClass;. // List of fields/attributes that should be same for all the instructions in; // a row of the relation table.

This document aims to provide a high-level overview of the design and; implementation of the ORC JIT APIs. Except where otherwise stated all discussion; refers to the modern ORCv2 APIs (available since LLVM 7). Clients wishing to; transition from OrcV1 should see Section :ref:`transitioning_orcv1_to_orcv2`. Use-cases; =========. ORC provides a modular API for building JIT compilers. There are a number; of use cases for such an API. For example:. 1. The LLVM tutorials use a simple ORC-based JIT class to execute expressions; compiled from a toy language: Kaleidoscope. 2. The LLVM debugger, LLDB, uses a cross-compiling JIT for expression; evaluation. In this use case, cross compilation allows expressions compiled; in the debugger process to be executed on the debug target process, which may; be on a different device/architecture. 3. In high-performance JITs (e.g. JVMs, Julia) that want to make use of LLVM's; optimizations within an existing JIT infrastructure. 4. In interpreters and REPLs, e.g. Cling (C++) and the Swift interpreter. By adopting a modular, library-based design we aim to make ORC useful in as many; of these contexts as possible. Features; ========. ORC provides the following features:. **JIT-linking**; ORC provides APIs to link relocatable object files (COFF, ELF, MachO) [1]_; into a target process at runtime. The target process may be the same process; that contains the JIT session object and jit-linker, or may be another process; (even one running on a different machine or architecture) that communicates; with the JIT via RPC. **LLVM IR compilation**; ORC provides off the shelf components (IRCompileLayer, SimpleCompiler,; ConcurrentIRCompiler) that make it easy to add LLVM IR to a JIT'd process. **Eager and lazy compilation**; By default, ORC will compile symbols as soon as they are looked up in the JIT; se",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:335,avail,available,335,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Basically you have to do two things at a minimum. First, decide whether the; bug `crashes the compiler`_ or if the compiler is `miscompiling`_ the program; (i.e., the compiler successfully produces an executable, but it doesn't run; right).

The most important piece of the puzzle; is to figure out if it is crashing in the Clang front-end or if it is one of; the LLVM libraries (e.g. the optimizer or code generator) that has; problems.

The main purpose of this pass is to recognize such functions and merge them. This document is the extension to pass comments and describes the pass logic. It; describes the algorithm that is used in order to compare functions and; explains how we could combine equal functions correctly to keep the module; valid.

Availability,"====================================; LLVM bugpoint tool: design and usage; ====================================. .. contents::; :local:. Description; ===========. ``bugpoint`` narrows down the source of problems in LLVM tools and passes. It; can be used to debug three types of failures: optimizer crashes, miscompilations; by optimizers, or bad native code generation (including problems in the static; and JIT compilers). It aims to reduce large test cases to small, useful ones.; For example, if ``opt`` crashes while optimizing a file, it will identify the; optimization (or combination of optimizations) that causes the crash, and reduce; the file down to a small example which triggers the crash. For detailed case scenarios, such as debugging ``opt``, or one of the LLVM code; generators, see :doc:`HowToSubmitABug`. Design Philosophy; =================. ``bugpoint`` is designed to be a useful tool without requiring any hooks into; the LLVM infrastructure at all. It works with any and all LLVM passes and code; generators, and does not need to ""know"" how they work. Because of this, it may; appear to do stupid things or miss obvious simplifications. ``bugpoint`` is; also designed to trade off programmer time for computer time in the; compiler-debugging process; consequently, it may take a long period of; (unattended) time to reduce a test case, but we feel it is still worth it. Note; that ``bugpoint`` is generally very quick unless debugging a miscompilation; where each test of the program (which requires executing it) takes a long time. Automatic Debugger Selection; ----------------------------. ``bugpoint`` reads each ``.bc`` or ``.ll`` file specified on the command line; and links them together into a single module, called the test program.

FIXME: these directions are outdated and won't work. Figure out; what the correct thing to do is, and write it down here. #. Configure and build ``llvm``. #. Configure and build ``llvm-gcc``. #. Install ``llvm-gcc`` somewhere. #. *Re-configure* ``llvm`` from the top level of each build tree (LLVM; object directory tree) in which you want to run the test suite, just; as you do before building LLVM. During the *re-configuration*, you must either: (1) have ``llvm-gcc``; you just built in your path, or (2) specify the directory where your; just-built ``llvm-gcc`` is installed using; ``--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR``. You must also tell the configure machinery that the test suite is; available so it can be configured for your build tree:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure [--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR]. [Remember that ``$LLVM_GCC_DIR`` is the directory where you; *installed* llvm-gcc, not its src or obj directory.]. #.

Availability,"=======================================; LLVM's Optional Rich Disassembly Output; =======================================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. LLVM's default disassembly output is raw text. To allow consumers more ability; to introspect the instructions' textual representation or to reformat for a more; user friendly display there is an optional rich disassembly output. This optional output is sufficient to reference into individual portions of the; instruction text. This is intended for clients like disassemblers, list file; generators, and pretty-printers, which need more than the raw instructions and; the ability to print them. To provide this functionality the assembly text is marked up with annotations.; The markup is simple enough in syntax to be robust even in the case of version; mismatches between consumers and producers. That is, the syntax generally does; not carry semantics beyond ""this text has an annotation,"" so consumers can; simply ignore annotations they do not understand or do not care about. After calling ``LLVMCreateDisasm()`` to create a disassembler context the; optional output is enable with this call:. .. code-block:: c. LLVMSetDisasmOptions(DC, LLVMDisassembler_Option_UseMarkup);. Then subsequent calls to ``LLVMDisasmInstruction()`` will return output strings; with the marked up annotations. Instruction Annotations; =======================. .. _contextual markups:. Contextual markups; ------------------. Annotated assembly display will supply contextual markup to help clients more; efficiently implement things like pretty printers. Most markup will be target; independent, so clients can effectively provide good display without any target; specific knowledge.

This document seeks to dispel the mystery and confusion surrounding LLVM's; `GetElementPtr <LangRef.html#getelementptr-instruction>`_ (GEP) instruction.; Questions about the wily GEP instruction are probably the most frequently; occurring questions once a developer gets down to coding with LLVM. Here we lay; out the sources of confusion and show that the GEP instruction is really quite; simple. Address Computation; ===================. When people are first confronted with the GEP instruction, they tend to relate; it to known concepts from other programming paradigms, most notably C array; indexing and field selection. GEP closely resembles C array indexing and field; selection, however it is a little different and this leads to the following; questions. What is the first index of the GEP instruction?; -----------------------------------------------. Quick answer: The index stepping through the second operand. The confusion with the first index usually arises from thinking about the; GetElementPtr instruction as if it was a C index operator. They aren't the; same. For example, when we write, in ""C"":. .. code-block:: c++. AType *Foo;; ...; X = &Foo->F;. it is natural to think that there is only one index, the selection of the field; ``F``. However, in this example, ``Foo`` is a pointer. That pointer; must be indexed explicitly in LLVM. C, on the other hand, indices through it; transparently. To arrive at the same address location as the C code, you would; provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. The first operand indexes; through the pointer; the second operand indexes the field ``F`` of the; structure, just as if you wrote:. .. code-block:: c++. X = &Foo[0].F;. Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:. .. _GEP index through first pointer:. *Why is it okay to index through the first",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:446,down,down,446,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['down'],['down']

Chapter 8 Introduction; ======================. Welcome to Chapter 8 of the ""`Implementing a language with LLVM; <index.html>`_"" tutorial. This chapter describes how to compile our; language down to object files. Choosing a target; =================. LLVM has native support for cross-compilation. You can compile to the; architecture of your current machine, or just as easily compile for; other architectures. In this tutorial, we'll target the current; machine. To specify the architecture that you want to target, we use a string; called a ""target triple"". This takes the form; ``<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>`` (see the `cross compilation docs; <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html#target-triple>`_). As an example, we can see what clang thinks is our current target; triple:. ::. $ clang --version | grep Target; Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. Running this command may show something different on your machine as; you might be using a different architecture or operating system to me. Fortunately, we don't need to hard-code a target triple to target the; current machine. LLVM provides ``sys::getDefaultTargetTriple``, which; returns the target triple of the current machine. .. code-block:: c++. auto TargetTriple = sys::getDefaultTargetTriple();. LLVM doesn't require us to link in all the target; functionality. For example, if we're just using the JIT, we don't need; the assembly printers. Similarly, if we're only targeting certain; architectures, we can only link in the functionality for those; architectures. For this example, we'll initialize all the targets for emitting object; code. .. code-block:: c++.

The text will be updated; once the API churn dies down.**. Welcome to Chapter 3 of the ""Building an ORC-based JIT in LLVM"" tutorial. This; chapter discusses lazy JITing and shows you how to enable it by adding an ORC; CompileOnDemand layer the JIT from `Chapter 2 <BuildingAJIT2.html>`_. Lazy Compilation; ================. When we add a module to the KaleidoscopeJIT class from Chapter 2 it is; immediately optimized, compiled and linked for us by the IRTransformLayer,; IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer respectively. This scheme, where all the; work to make a Module executable is done up front, is simple to understand and; its performance characteristics are easy to reason about. However, it will lead; to very high startup times if the amount of code to be compiled is large, and; may also do a lot of unnecessary compilation if only a few compiled functions; are ever called at runtime. A truly ""just-in-time"" compiler should allow us to; defer the compilation of any given function until the moment that function is; first called, improving launch times and eliminating redundant work. In fact,; the ORC APIs provide us with a layer to lazily compile LLVM IR:; *CompileOnDemandLayer*. The CompileOnDemandLayer class conforms to the layer interface described in; Chapter 2, but its addModule method behaves quite differently from the layers; we have seen so far: rather than doing any work up front, it just scans the; Modules being added and arranges for each",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst:573,down,down,573,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"==============================================; JSON Compilation Database Format Specification; ==============================================. This document describes a format for specifying how to replay single; compilations independently of the build system. Background; ==========. Tools based on the C++ Abstract Syntax Tree need full information how to; parse a translation unit. Usually this information is implicitly; available in the build system, but running tools as part of the build; system is not necessarily the best solution:. - Build systems are inherently change driven, so running multiple tools; over the same code base without changing the code does not fit into; the architecture of many build systems.; - Figuring out whether things have changed is often an IO bound; process; this makes it hard to build low latency end user tools based; on the build system.; - Build systems are inherently sequential in the build graph, for; example due to generated source code. While tools that run; independently of the build still need the generated source code to; exist, running tools multiple times over unchanging source does not; require serialization of the runs according to the build dependency; graph. Supported Systems; =================. Clang has the ability to generate compilation database fragments via; ``-MJ argument <clang -MJ\<arg>>``. You can concatenate those; fragments together between ``[`` and ``]`` to create a compilation database. Currently `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ (since 2.8.5) supports generation; of compilation databases for Unix Makefile builds (Ninja builds in the; works) with the option ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS``. For projects on Linux, there is an alternative to intercept compiler; calls with a tool called `Bear <https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear>`_. `Bazel <https://bazel.build>`_ can export a compilation database via; `this extractor extension; <https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor>`_.; Bazel is otherwise",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:426,avail,available,426,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

These; were originally added in C++11 and C11. The memory model has been; subsequently adjusted to correct errors in the initial; specification, so LLVM currently intends to implement the version; specified by C++20. (See the `C++20 draft standard; <https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N4860.pdf>`_ or the unofficial; `latest C++ draft <https://eel.is/c++draft/>`_.

Atomic and volatile in the IR are orthogonal; ""volatile"" is the C/C++ volatile,; which ensures that every volatile load and store happens and is performed in the; stated order. A couple examples: if a SequentiallyConsistent store is; immediately followed by another SequentiallyConsistent store to the same; address, the first store can be erased. This transformation is not allowed for a; pair of volatile stores. On the other hand, a non-volatile non-atomic load can; be moved across a volatile load freely, but not an Acquire load.

Introduction; ============. The -opt-bisect-limit option provides a way to disable all optimization passes; above a specified limit without modifying the way in which the Pass Managers; are populated. The intention of this option is to assist in tracking down; problems where incorrect transformations during optimization result in incorrect; run-time behavior. This feature is implemented on an opt-in basis. Passes which can be safely; skipped while still allowing correct code generation call a function to; check the opt-bisect limit before performing optimizations. Passes which; either must be run or do not modify the IR do not perform this check and are; therefore never skipped. Generally, this means analysis passes, passes; that are run at CodeGenOptLevel::None and passes which are required for register; allocation. The -opt-bisect-limit option can be used with any tool, including front ends; such as clang, that uses the core LLVM library for optimization and code; generation. The exact syntax for invoking the option is discussed below. This feature is not intended to replace other debugging tools such as bugpoint.; Rather it provides an alternate course of action when reproducing the problem; requires a complex build infrastructure that would make using bugpoint; impractical or when reproducing the failure requires a sequence of; transformations that is difficult to replicate with tools like opt and llc.

It is; explicitly aimed at people who are new to Clang, so all you should need; is a working knowledge of C++ and the command line. In order to work on the compiler, you need some basic knowledge of the; abstract syntax tree (AST). To this end, the reader is encouraged to; skim the :doc:`Introduction to the Clang; AST <IntroductionToTheClangAST>`. Step 0: Obtaining Clang; =======================. As Clang is part of the LLVM project, you'll need to download LLVM's; source code first. Both Clang and LLVM are in the same git repository,; under different directories. For further information, see the `getting; started guide <https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html>`_. .. code-block:: console. mkdir ~/clang-llvm && cd ~/clang-llvm; git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git.

Availability,"===================================================================; How To Add Your Build Configuration To LLVM Buildbot Infrastructure; ===================================================================. Introduction; ============. This document contains information about adding a build configuration and; buildbot-worker to private worker builder to LLVM Buildbot Infrastructure. Buildmasters; ============. There are two buildmasters running. * The main buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/buildbot>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will notify commit authors every time they break; the build.; * The staging buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/staging>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will be completely silent by default when the build; is broken. This buildmaster is reconfigured every two hours with any new; commits from the llvm-zorg repository. In order to remain connected to the main buildmaster (and thus notify; developers of failures), a builbot must:. * Be building a supported configuration. Builders for experimental backends; should generally be attached to staging buildmaster.; * Be able to keep up with new commits to the main branch, or at a minimum; recover to tip of tree within a couple of days of falling behind. Additionally, we encourage all bot owners to point their bots towards the; staging master during maintenance windows, instability troubleshooting, and; such. Roles & Expectations; ====================. Each buildbot has an owner who is the responsible party for addressing problems; which arise with said buildbot. We generally expect the bot owner to be; reasonably responsive. For some bots, the ownership responsibility is split between a ""resource owner""; who provides the underlying machine resource, and a ""configuration owner"" who; maintains the build configuration. Generally, operational responsibility lies; with the ""config owner"".

Composite shapes are Boolean combinations of two or more shape; components. The supported Boolean operations are union (+), intersection; (\*) and subtraction(-). Composite shapes derive from the base; **`TGeoShape`** class, therefore providing all shape features:; computation of bounding box, finding if a given point is inside or; outside the combination, as well as computing the distance to; entering/exiting.

This `CSG`; `(composite solid geometry)` hierarchy is effective for small number of; components, while performance drops dramatically for large structures.; Building a complete geometry in this style is virtually possible but; highly not recommended. #### The Structure of Composite Shapes. A composite shape can always be looked as the result of a Boolean; operation between only two shape components. All information identifying; these two components as well as their positions with respect to the; frame of the composite is represented by an object called Boolean node.; A composite shape has a pointer to such a Boolean node.

Controlling Diagnostics via Pragmas; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clang can also control what diagnostics are enabled through the use of; pragmas in the source code. This is useful for turning off specific; warnings in a section of source code. Clang supports GCC's pragma for; compatibility with existing source code, as well as several extensions. The pragma may control any warning that can be used from the command; line. Warnings may be set to ignored, warning, error, or fatal. The; following example code will tell Clang or GCC to ignore the -Wall; warnings:. .. code-block:: c. #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored ""-Wall"". In addition to all of the functionality provided by GCC's pragma, Clang; also allows you to push and pop the current warning state. This is; particularly useful when writing a header file that will be compiled by; other people, because you don't know what warning flags they build with. In the below example :option:`-Wextra-tokens` is ignored for only a single line; of code, after which the diagnostics return to whatever state had previously; existed. .. code-block:: c. #if foo; #endif foo // warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive. #pragma clang diagnostic push; #pragma clang diagnostic ignored ""-Wextra-tokens"". #if foo; #endif foo // no warning. #pragma clang diagnostic pop.

If the former, clone the repository, check out a specific tagged release as; needed, then run the following steps to add Cling and build a wheel.; Once built, install the wheel as appropriate::. $ git clone https://github.com/wlav/cppyy-backend.git; $ cd cppyy-backend/cling; $ python setup.py egg_info; $ python create_src_directory.py; $ python setup.py bdist_wheel; $ python -m pip install dist/cppyy_cling-* --upgrade. .. note::; ``cppyy-cling`` wheels do not depend on the Python interpreter and can; thus be re-used for any version of Python or PyPy.

Availability,"Deploying the Virtual Analysis Facility; =======================================. Introduction; ------------. Thanks to CernVM and PROOF on Demand, it is possible to deploy a ready; to use Virtual Analysis Facility on your cloud (either public, private; or even your desktop computer). On the server side, ""configuring"" the Virtual Analysis Facility is; simply a matter of starting a certain number of CernVM virtual machines; that will become part of your PROOF cluster. CernVM uses; contextualization to specialize each virtual machine to be either a head; node or a worker node. The Virtual Analysis Facility comes with many preconfigured things:. - a HTCondor cluster capable of running PROOF on Demand. - certificate authentication. - your experiment's software (if available on CernVM-FS). Obtain the CernVM image and contextualization; ---------------------------------------------. ### Download the CernVM bare image.

Availability,"F1::IsLinear()` is `true`).; The parameter derivatives of the model function can be useful to some minimization algorithms, such as Fumili.; However, in general is better to leave the minimization algorithm (e.g. Minuit) to compute the needed derivatives using its own customised; numerical differentiation algorithm.; In order to not provide to the fitter the parameter derivatives, we explicitly passed in `Fitter::SetFunction` a `false` value. ### Fit Configuration. The configuration of the fit is done via the `ROOT::Fit::FitConfig` class and its contained `ROOT::Fit::ParameterSettings` class.; These are the possible allowed fit configurations:. - setting the initial values of the parameters;; - setting the parameter step sizes;; - setting eventual parameter bounds;; - setting the minimizer library and the particular algorithm to use;; - setting different minimization options (print level, tolerance, max iterations, etc...); - setting the type of parameter errors to compute (parabolic error, Minos errors, re-normalize errors using fitted chi2 values). The initial parameter values can be set directly in the input model function object.; However, for setting parameter bounds and step sizes to values different than the automatically computed ones, one needs to use the `ROOT::Fit::ParameterSetting` class.; This example code will set the lower/upper bounds for the first parameter and a lower bound for the second parameter. ``` {.cpp}; fitter.SetFunction( fitFunction, false);; fitter.Config().ParSettings(0).SetLimits(0,1.E6);; fitter.Config().ParSettings(2).SetLowerLimit(0);; ```.

Here's another idea with respect to keeping the common case instruction; size down (less than 32 bits ideally):. Instead of encoding an instruction to operate on two register numbers,; have it operate on two negative offsets based on the current register; number. Therefore, instead of using:. r57 = add r55, r56 (r57 is the implicit dest register, of course). We could use:. r57 = add -2, -1. My guess is that most SSA references are to recent values (especially if; they correspond to expressions like (x+y*z+p*q/ ...), so the negative; numbers would tend to stay small, even at the end of the procedure (where; the implicit register destination number could be quite large).

Availability,"Inlining; ========. There are several options that control which calls the analyzer will consider for; inlining. The major one is ``-analyzer-config ipa``:. * ``analyzer-config ipa=none`` - All inlining is disabled. This is the only mode; available in LLVM 3.1 and earlier and in Xcode 4.3 and earlier. * ``analyzer-config ipa=basic-inlining`` - Turns on inlining for C functions, C++; static member functions, and blocks -- essentially, the calls that behave; like simple C function calls. This is essentially the mode used in; Xcode 4.4. * ``analyzer-config ipa=inlining`` - Turns on inlining when we can confidently find; the function/method body corresponding to the call. (C functions, static; functions, devirtualized C++ methods, Objective-C class methods, Objective-C; instance methods when ExprEngine is confident about the dynamic type of the; instance). * ``analyzer-config ipa=dynamic`` - Inline instance methods for which the type is; determined at runtime and we are not 100% sure that our type info is; correct. For virtual calls, inline the most plausible definition. * ``analyzer-config ipa=dynamic-bifurcate`` - Same as -analyzer-config ipa=dynamic,; but the path is split. We inline on one branch and do not inline on the; other. This mode does not drop the coverage in cases when the parent class; has code that is only exercised when some of its methods are overridden. Currently, ``-analyzer-config ipa=dynamic-bifurcate`` is the default mode. While ``-analyzer-config ipa`` determines in general how aggressively the analyzer; will try to inline functions, several additional options control which types of; functions can inlined, in an all-or-nothing way. These options use the; analyzer's configuration table, so they are all specified as follows:. ``-analyzer-config OPTION=VALUE``. c++-inlining; ------------.

Availability,"Known Bits Analysis; ===================. The Known Bits Analysis pass makes information about the known values of bits; available to other passes to enable transformations like those in the examples; below. The information is lazily computed so you should only pay for what you; use. Examples; --------. A simple example is that transforming::. a + 1. into::. a | 1. is only valid when the addition doesn't carry. In other words it's only valid; if ``a & 1`` is zero. Another example is:. .. code-block:: none. %1:(s32) = G_CONSTANT i32 0xFF0; %2:(s32) = G_AND %0, %1; %3:(s32) = G_CONSTANT i32 0x0FF; %4:(s32) = G_AND %2, %3. We can use the constants and the definition of ``G_AND`` to determine the known; bits:. .. code-block:: none. ; %0 = 0x????????; %1:(s32) = G_CONSTANT i32 0xFF0 ; %1 = 0x00000FF0; %2:(s32) = G_AND %0, %1 ; %2 = 0x00000??0; %3:(s32) = G_CONSTANT i32 0x0FF ; %3 = 0x000000FF; %4:(s32) = G_AND %2, %3 ; %4 = 0x000000?0. and then use this to simplify the expression:. .. code-block:: none. ; %0 = 0x????????; %5:(s32) = G_CONSTANT i32 0x0F0 ; %5 = 0x00000FF0; %4:(s32) = G_AND %0, %5 ; %4 = 0x000000?0. Note that ``%4`` still has the same known bits as before the transformation.; Many transformations share this property. The main exception being when the; transform causes undefined bits to become defined to either zero, one, or; defined but unknown. Usage; -----.

Availability,"LLVM source-base makes extensive use of a custom form of RTTI. These; templates have many similarities to the C++ ``dynamic_cast<>`` operator, but; they don't have some drawbacks (primarily stemming from the fact that; ``dynamic_cast<>`` only works on classes that have a v-table). Because they are; used so often, you must know what they do and how they work. All of these; templates are defined in the ``llvm/Support/Casting.h`` (`doxygen; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/Casting_8h_source.html>`__) file (note that you very; rarely have to include this file directly). ``isa<>``:; The ``isa<>`` operator works exactly like the Java ""``instanceof``"" operator.; It returns true or false depending on whether a reference or pointer points to; an instance of the specified class. This can be very useful for constraint; checking of various sorts (example below). ``cast<>``:; The ``cast<>`` operator is a ""checked cast"" operation. It converts a pointer; or reference from a base class to a derived class, causing an assertion; failure if it is not really an instance of the right type. This should be; used in cases where you have some information that makes you believe that; something is of the right type. An example of the ``isa<>`` and ``cast<>``; template is:. .. code-block:: c++. static bool isLoopInvariant(const Value *V, const Loop *L) {; if (isa<Constant>(V) || isa<Argument>(V) || isa<GlobalValue>(V)); return true;. // Otherwise, it must be an instruction...; return !L->contains(cast<Instruction>(V)->getParent());; }. Note that you should **not** use an ``isa<>`` test followed by a ``cast<>``,; for that use the ``dyn_cast<>`` operator. ``dyn_cast<>``:; The ``dyn_cast<>`` operator is a ""checking cast"" operation. It checks to see; if the operand is of the specified type, and if so, returns a pointer to it; (this operator does not work with references). If the operand is not of the; correct type, a null pointer is returned. Thus, this works very much like; the ``dynamic_cast<>`` operato",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:4691,failure,failure,4691,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['failure'],['failure']
Availability,"LLVMStyleRTTI>`. .. _string_apis:. Passing strings (the ``StringRef`` and ``Twine`` classes); ---------------------------------------------------------. Although LLVM generally does not do much string manipulation, we do have several; important APIs which take strings. Two important examples are the Value class; -- which has names for instructions, functions, etc. -- and the ``StringMap``; class which is used extensively in LLVM and Clang. These are generic classes, and they need to be able to accept strings which may; have embedded null characters. Therefore, they cannot simply take a ``const; char *``, and taking a ``const std::string&`` requires clients to perform a heap; allocation which is usually unnecessary. Instead, many LLVM APIs use a; ``StringRef`` or a ``const Twine&`` for passing strings efficiently. .. _StringRef:. The ``StringRef`` class; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``StringRef`` data type represents a reference to a constant string (a; character array and a length) and supports the common operations available on; ``std::string``, but does not require heap allocation. It can be implicitly constructed using a C style null-terminated string, an; ``std::string``, or explicitly with a character pointer and length. For; example, the ``StringMap`` find function is declared as:. .. code-block:: c++. iterator find(StringRef Key);. and clients can call it using any one of:. .. code-block:: c++. Map.find(""foo""); // Lookup ""foo""; Map.find(std::string(""bar"")); // Lookup ""bar""; Map.find(StringRef(""\0baz"", 4)); // Lookup ""\0baz"".

When changing PSTATE.SM the execution of FP/vector operations may be transferred; to another processing element. This has three important implications:. * The runtime SVE vector length may change. * The contents of FP/AdvSIMD/SVE registers are zeroed. * The set of allowable instructions changes. This leads to certain restrictions on IR and optimizations. For example, it; is undefined behaviour to share vector-length dependent state between functions; that may operate with different values for PSTATE.SM. Front-ends must honour; these restrictions when generating LLVM IR. Even though the runtime SVE vector length may change, for the purpose of LLVM IR; and almost all parts of CodeGen we can assume that the runtime value for; ``vscale`` does not.

Availability,"Languages Mapped to SIMT Hardware; ---------------------------------------------------------. If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner,; then the variable DWARF location expressions must compute the location for a; single lane of the wavefront. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote; the current lane, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`. In addition, a way is needed for the compiler to communicate how many source; language threads of execution are mapped to a target architecture thread's SIMT; lanes. See ``DW_AT_LLVM_lanes`` in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-low-level-information`. .. _amdgpu-dwarf-support-for-divergent-control-flow-of-simt-hardware:. 2.13 Support for Divergent Control Flow of SIMT Hardware; --------------------------------------------------------. If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner the; compiler can use the AMDGPU execution mask register to control which lanes are; active. To describe the conceptual location of non-active lanes requires an; attribute that has an expression that computes the source location PC for each; lane. For efficiency, the expression calculates the source location the wavefront as a; whole. This can be done using the ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-to-create-vector-composite-location-descriptions`); operation. The AMDGPU may update the execution mask to perform whole wavefront operations.; Therefore, there is a need for an attribute that computes the current active; lane mask. This can have an expression that may evaluate to the SIMT active lane; mask register or to a saved mask when in whole wavefront execution mode. An example that uses these attributes is referenced in the; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-further-examples` appendix.

Availability,"M_lane_pc`` of the; calling subprogram until it finds a non-undefined location. Conceptually the; lane only has the call frames that it has a non-undefined; ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc``. The following example illustrates how the AMDGPU backend can generate a DWARF; location list expression for the nested ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` structures of the; following subprogram pseudo code for a target with 64 lanes per wavefront. .. code::; :number-lines:. SUBPROGRAM X; BEGIN; a;; IF (c1) THEN; b;; IF (c2) THEN; c;; ELSE; d;; ENDIF; e;; ELSE; f;; ENDIF; g;; END. The AMDGPU backend may generate the following pseudo LLVM MIR to manipulate the; execution mask (``EXEC``) to linearize the control flow. The condition is; evaluated to make a mask of the lanes for which the condition evaluates to true.; First the ``THEN`` region is executed by setting the ``EXEC`` mask to the; logical ``AND`` of the current ``EXEC`` mask with the condition mask. Then the; ``ELSE`` region is executed by negating the ``EXEC`` mask and logical ``AND`` of; the saved ``EXEC`` mask at the start of the region. After the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``; region the ``EXEC`` mask is restored to the value it had at the beginning of the; region. This is shown below. Other approaches are possible, but the basic; concept is the same. .. code::; :number-lines:. $lex_start:; a;; %1 = EXEC; %2 = c1; $lex_1_start:; EXEC = %1 & %2; $if_1_then:; b;; %3 = EXEC; %4 = c2; $lex_1_1_start:; EXEC = %3 & %4; $lex_1_1_then:; c;; EXEC = ~EXEC & %3; $lex_1_1_else:; d;; EXEC = %3; $lex_1_1_end:; e;; EXEC = ~EXEC & %1; $lex_1_else:; f;; EXEC = %1; $lex_1_end:; g;; $lex_end:.

Availability,"Math/ProbFunc.h`. The majority of the CDF's are present in the; `MathCore`, apart from the `chisquared`, `fdistribution`, `gamma` and; `tdistribution`, which are in the `MathMore` library. #### Inverse of the Cumulative Distribution Functions(Quantiles). For almost all the cumulative distribution functions (`_cdf`) and their; complements (`_cdf_c`) present in the library, we provide the inverse; functions. The inverse of the cumulative distribution function is called; in statistics quantile function. The functions with the extension; `_quantile` calculate the inverse of the cumulative distribution; function (lower tail integral of the probability density function),; while those with the *`quantile_c`* extension calculate the inverse of; the complement of the cumulative distribution (upper tail integral). All; the inverse distributions are in the MathMore library and are defined in; the header file `Math/ProbFuncInv.h`. The following picture illustrates the available statistical functions; (PDF, CDF and quantiles) in the case of the normal distribution. ![PDF, CDF and quantiles in the case of the normal distribution](pictures/03000128.png). ## Numerical Algorithms. ROOT provides C++ classes implementing numerical algorithms to solve a wide set of problem, like:. * Evaluation of function derivatives.; * Evaluation of integrals.; * Finding the roots of a function; * Finding the minimum/maximum of a function. In order to use these algorithm the user needs to provide a function.; ROOT provides a common way of specifying them via some interfaces. ## ROOT::Math Function interfaces. To get a consistency in the mathematical methods within ROOT, there exists a set of interfaces to define the basic behaviour of a mathematical function.; In order to use the classes presented in this chapter, the mathematical functions defined by the user must inherit from any of the classes seen in the figure:. ![ROOT::Math Function interface structure](pictures/function-hierarchy.png). ### One",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:34134,avail,available,34134,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['avail'],['available']

Users can define the vectors according to the coordinate type, which is; the most efficient for their use. Transformations between the various; coordinate systems are available through copy constructors or the; assignment (=) operator. For maximum flexibility and minimize memory; allocation, the coordinate system classes are templated on the scalar; type. To avoid exposing templated parameter to the users, typedefs are; defined for all types of vectors based on doubles. See in the examples; for all the possible types of vector classes, which can be constructed; by users with the available coordinate system types. #### Coordinate System Tag. The 2D and 3D points and vector classes can be associated to a tag; defining the coordinate system. This can be used to distinguish between; vectors of different coordinate systems like global or local vectors.; The coordinate system tag is a template parameter of the; **`ROOT::Math::`**`DisplacementVector3D` and; `ROOT::Math::PositionVector3D` (and also for 2D classes). A default tag; exists for users who do not need this functionality,; `ROOT::Math::DefaultCoordinateSystemTag`. #### Transformations. The transformations are modeled using simple (non-template) classes,; using double as the scalar type to avoid too large numerical errors. The; transformations are grouped in rotations (in 3 dimensions), Lorentz; transformations and Poincare transformations, which are; translation`/`rotation combinations. Each group has several members; which may model physically equivalent transformation",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:71921,avail,available,71921,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['avail'],['available']

RooFit has its internal representation of infinity in `RooNumber::infinity()`, which was `1e30` before. Now, it is defined as `std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`, to be consistent with the C++ standard library and other code. This change also affects the `RooNumber::isInfinite()` function. ### Remove `add(row, weight, weightError)` from RooAbsData interface. It was not good to have this signature in RooAbsData, because the; implementations in the two derived classes RooDataHist and RooDataSet were; inconsistent. The RooDataSet indeed took the weight error as the third argument, but; the RooDataHist version instead took the sum of weights squared, which; is equivalent to the squared weight error. Therefore, the virtual `RooAbsData::add(row, weight, weightError)` function was removed. ### Removal of `RooMomentMorphND` class. The `RooMomentMorphND` and `RooMomentMorphFuncND` were almost exactly the same,; only that one inherited from `RooAbsPdf` and the other from `RooAbsReal`. Thanks to the `RooWrapperPdf`, this code duplication in the RooFit implementation can now be avoided.; Instead of using the removed `RooMomentMorphND` (which is the pdf), you now need to use the `RooMomentMorphFuncND`,; change its behavior to exactly match the formter `RooMomentMorphND`, and then wrap it into a pdf object:. ```C++; RooMomentMorphFuncND func{<constructor args you previously passed to RooMomentMorphFunc>};. func.setPdfMode(); // change behavior to be exactly like the former RooMomentMorphND. // Pass the selfNormalized=true` flag to the wrapper because the; RooMomentMorphFuncND already normalizes its",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md:13528,error,error,13528,README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,2,['error'],['error']

If the covered binary is a universal binary, select the architecture to use.; It is an error to specify an architecture that is not included in the; universal binary or to use an architecture that does not match a; non-universal binary. .. option:: -format=<FORMAT>. Use the specified output format. The supported formats are: ""text"" (JSON),; ""lcov"". .. option:: -summary-only. Export only summary information for each file in the coverage data. This mode; will not export coverage information for smaller units such as individual; functions or regions. The result will contain the same information as produced; by the :program:`llvm-cov report` command, but presented in JSON or lcov; format rather than text. .. option:: -ignore-filename-regex=<PATTERN>. Skip source code files with file paths that match the given regular expression. .. option:: -skip-expansions. Skip exporting macro expansion coverage data. .. option:: -skip-functions.

There are several ways of obtaining `PyROOT`, and which is best depends; on your specific situation. If you work at CERN, you can use the; installation available on `afs`. Otherwise, you will want to build from; source, as `PyROOT` is not build by default in the binaries distributed; from the ROOT project site.

ROOT installations with the build of `PyROOT` enabled are available from; the CERN `afs` cell `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`. To use; them, simply modify your shell environment accordingly. For Unix:. `export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PYTHONDIR/bin:$PATH`. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH`. For Windows:. `set PATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONDIR%/bin;%PATH%`. `set PYTHONPATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONPATH%`. where `$ROOTSYS` should be set to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`, and `PYTHONDIR` to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Python/2.3.4/<platform>` with `<version>`; and `<platform>` as appropriate. Note that the latest version of Python; is 2.4.1. #### Building from Source. The standard installation instructions for building ROOT from source; apply, with the addition that the build of `PyROOT` needs to be enabled; at the configuration step. First, follow the instructions for obtaining; and unpacking the source, and setting up the build environment.

For example, at; initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as; specified by the user. After a `HESSE` step, the errors are usually; quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. `Minuit`, when it; prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it; thinks they are. For example, those marked `CURRENT GUESS ERROR` are; only working values not to be believed, and `APPROXIMATE ERROR` means; that they have been calculated but there is reason to believe that; they may not be accurate.

Some visible signs that `Minuit` may have; been fooled:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error; analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum). - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parameterized so that individual errors are; not very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit.

Availability,"RNTuple Introduction; ====================. RNTuple (for n-tuple and nested tuple) is the experimental evolution of TTree columnar data storage. RNTuple introduces; new interfaces that aim to be more robust. In particular, the new interfaces are type-safe through the use of; templates, and the ownership is well-defined through the use of smart pointers. For instance. tree->Branch(""px"", &Category, ""px/F"");. becomes. auto px = model->MakeField<float>(""px"");; // px is std::shared_ptr<float>. The physical layout changes slightly from big endian to little endian so that it matches the in-memory layout on; most modern architectures. Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which re",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md:200,robust,robust,200,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,1,['robust'],['robust']

If a conversion is wanted it can be done; explicitly using a ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. GDB has a per register hook that allows a target specific conversion on a; register by register basis. It defaults to truncation of bigger registers.; Removing use of the target hook does not cause any test failures in common; architectures. If the compiler for a target architecture did want some; form of conversion, including a larger result type, it could always; explicitly use the ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. If T is a larger type than the register size, then the default GDB; register hook reads bytes from the next register (or reads out of bounds; for the last register!). Removing use of the target hook does not cause; any test failures in common architectures (except an illegal hand written; assembly test).

Utilities for Writing Fuzzers; =============================. There are some utilities available for writing fuzzers in LLVM. Some helpers for handling the command line interface are available in; ``include/llvm/FuzzMutate/FuzzerCLI.h``, including functions to parse command; line options in a consistent way and to implement standalone main functions so; your fuzzer can be built and tested when not built against libFuzzer. There is also some handling of the CMake config for fuzzers, where you should; use the ``add_llvm_fuzzer`` to set up fuzzer targets. This function works; similarly to functions such as ``add_llvm_tool``, but they take care of linking; to LibFuzzer when appropriate and can be passed the ``DUMMY_MAIN`` argument to; enable standalone testing.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst:9657,avail,available,9657,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst,2,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"SUMMARY; -------. We met to discuss the LLVM instruction format and bytecode representation:. ISSUES RESOLVED; ---------------. 1. We decided that we shall use a flat namespace to represent our ; variables in SSA form, as opposed to having a two dimensional namespace; of the original variable and the SSA instance subscript. ARGUMENT AGAINST:; * A two dimensional namespace would be valuable when doing alias ; analysis because the extra information can help limit the scope of; analysis. ARGUMENT FOR:; * Including this information would require that all users of the LLVM; bytecode would have to parse and handle it. This would slow down the; common case and inflate the instruction representation with another; infinite variable space. REASONING:; * It was decided that because original variable sources could be; reconstructed from SSA form in linear time, that it would be an; unjustified expense for the common case to include the extra; information for one optimization. Alias analysis itself is typically; greater than linear in asymptotic complexity, so this extra analaysis; would not affect the runtime of the optimization in a significant; way. Additionally, this would be an unlikely optimization to do at; runtime. IDEAS TO CONSIDER; -----------------. 1. Including dominator information in the LLVM bytecode; representation. This is one example of an analysis result that may be; packaged with the bytecodes themselves. As a conceptual implementation ; idea, we could include an immediate dominator number for each basic block; in the LLVM bytecode program. Basic blocks could be numbered according; to the order of occurrence in the bytecode representation. 2. Including loop header and body information. This would facilitate; detection of intervals and natural loops. UNRESOLVED ISSUES ; ----------------- . 1.

If a pointer passed; to our functions does not fit those, something is definitely wrong. - ``""allocation type mismatch""``: when the optional deallocation type mismatch; check is enabled, a deallocation function called on a chunk has to match the; type of function that was called to allocate it. Security implications of such; a mismatch are not necessarily obvious but situational at best;. - ``""invalid sized delete""``: when the C++14 sized delete operator is used, and; the optional check enabled, this indicates that the size passed when; deallocating a chunk is not congruent with the one requested when allocating; it.

Conditional substitution: if ``feature`` is available it expands to; ``<if branch>``, otherwise it expands to ``<else branch>``.; ``%else %{<else branch>%}`` is optional and treated like ``%else %{%}``; if not present. ``%(line)``, ``%(line+<number>)``, ``%(line-<number>)``. The number of the line where this substitution is used, with an; optional integer offset. These expand only if they appear; immediately in ``RUN:``, ``DEFINE:``, and ``REDEFINE:`` directives.; Occurrences in substitutions defined elsewhere are never expanded.; For example, this can be used in tests with multiple RUN lines,; which reference the test file's line numbers. **LLVM-specific substitutions:**. ``%shlibext``; The suffix for the host platforms shared library files.

Availability,"The user can force a collection to delete its objects, but that is; the user's choice. ### Determining the Class of Contained Objects. Most containers may hold heterogeneous collections of objects and then; it is left to the user to correctly cast the **`TObject`** pointer to; the right class. Casting to the wrong class will give wrong results and; may well crash the program! Therefore, the user has to be very careful.; Often a container only contains one class of objects, but if it really; contains a mixture, it is possible to ask each object about its class; using the `InheritsFrom` method. For example if `myObject` is a **`TObject`** pointer:. ``` {.cpp}; if (myObject->InheritsFrom(""TParticle"") {; printf(""myObject is a TParticlen"");; }; ```. As the name suggests, this test works even if the object is a subclass; of **`TParticle`**. The member function `IsA()` can be used instead of; `InheritsFrom` to make the test exact. The `InheritsFrom` and `IsA`; methods use the extensive Run Time Type Information (RTTI) available via; the ROOT meta-classes. ### Types of Collections. The ROOT system implements the following basic types of collections:; unordered collections, ordered collections and sorted collections. Next; figure shows the inheritance hierarchy for the primary collection; classes. All primary collection classes derive from the abstract base; class **`TCollection`**. ![The inheritance hierarchy of the primary collection classes](pictures/020001A3.jpg). ### Ordered Collections (Sequences).

Availability,"These settings are not optimal for most; desktop systems, and we hope that packagers (e.g., Redhat, Debian, MacPorts,; etc.) will tweak them. This document lists settings we suggest you tweak. LLVM's API changes with each release, so users are likely to want, for example,; both LLVM-2.6 and LLVM-2.7 installed at the same time to support apps developed; against each. Compile Flags; =============. LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed.; However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without; defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug problems; in user code. We recommend allowing users to install both optimized and debug; versions of LLVM in parallel. The following configure flags are relevant:. ``--disable-assertions``; Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined. Changes the LLVM ABI. Also available; by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s environment. This; defaults to enabled regardless of the optimization setting, but it slows; things down. ``--enable-debug-symbols``; Builds LLVM with ``-g``. Also available by setting ``DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to disabled when optimizing, so you; should turn it back on to let users debug their programs. ``--enable-optimized``; (For git checkouts) Builds LLVM with ``-O2`` and, by default, turns off; debug symbols. Also available by setting ``ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to enabled when not in a; checkout. C++ Features; ============. RTTI; LLVM disables RTTI by default. Add ``REQUIRES_RTTI=1`` to your environment; while running ``make`` to re-enable it. This will allow users to build with; RTTI enabled and still inherit from LLVM classes. Shared Library; ==============. Configure with ``--enable-shared`` to build; ``libLLVM-<major>.<minor>.(so|dylib)`` and link the tools against it.

The file header is always; at the beginning of the file, while the data records and free segments; may in principle appear in any order. The file header is fixed length (64 bytes in the current; release.) It's detailed format is given in \ref header. A free segment is of variable length. One free segment is a set; of contiguous bytes that are unused, and are available for ROOTIO to use; for new or resized data records. The first four bytes of a a free; segment contain the negative of the number of bytes in the segment. The; contents of the remainder of the free segment are irrelevant.

In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you would not need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. #### Interpretation of Parameter Errors.

Although simply modifying types of a local variable doesn't normally impact the; ABI, taking the address of such a modified type could create a pointer type that; has an ABI mismatch. Looking at the following example, ``int *local`` is; implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable`` and thus the type of ``&local`` is a; pointer to ``int *__bidi_indexable``. On the other hand, in ``void foo(int; **)``, the parameter type is a pointer to ``int *__single`` (i.e., ``void; foo(int *__single *__single)``) (or a pointer to ``int *__unsafe_indexable`` if; it's from a system header). The compiler reports an error for casts between; pointers whose elements have incompatible pointer attributes. This way,; ``-fbounds-safety`` prevents pointers that are implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``; from silently escaping thereby breaking the ABI. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int **);. void bar(void) {; int *local = 0;; // error: passing 'int *__bidi_indexable*__bidi_indexable' to parameter of; // incompatible nested pointer type 'int *__single*__single'; foo(&local);; }. A local variable may still be exposed to the ABI if ``typeof()`` takes the type; of local variable to define an interface as shown in the following example. .. code-block:: C. // bar.c; void bar(int *) { ... }. // foo.c; void foo(void) {; int *p; // implicitly `int *__bidi_indexable p`; extern void bar(typeof(p)); // creates an interface of type; // `void bar(int *__bidi_indexable)`; }.

This pass would produce the following IR:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @test() gc ""statepoint-example"" {; call void @do_safepoint(); call void @foo(); ret void; }.

For X86, there are three modes for the compact unwind encoding:. *Function with a Frame Pointer (``EBP`` or ``RBP``)*; ``EBP/RBP``-based frame, where ``EBP/RBP`` is pushed onto the stack; immediately after the return address, then ``ESP/RSP`` is moved to; ``EBP/RBP``. Thus to unwind, ``ESP/RSP`` is restored with the current; ``EBP/RBP`` value, then ``EBP/RBP`` is restored by popping the stack, and the; return is done by popping the stack once more into the PC.

If; `SQRT(Y)` was the correct error in the case above, then; `SQRT(Y)/SQRT(N)` would be the correct error here. In fact, any bin; with non-zero number of entries N but with zero spread; (`spread = s[j]`) should have an uncertainty `SQRT(Y)/SQRT(N)`. Now,; is `SQRT(Y)/SQRT(N)` really the correct uncertainty ? That it is only; in the case where the Y variable is some sort of counting statistics,; following a Poisson distribution. This is the default case. However, Y; can be any variable from an original `NTUPLE`, and does not; necessarily follow a Poisson distribution. The computation of errors; is based on Y = values of data points; N = number of data points. - `' '` - the default is blank, the errors are:. - `spread/SQRT(N)` for a non-zero spread. - `SQRT(Y)/SQRT(N)` for a spread of zero and some data points. - `0` for no data points. - ‘ `s` ' - errors are:. - `spread` for a non-zero spread. - `SQRT(Y)` for a Spread of zero and some data points. - `0` for no data points. - ‘ `i` ' - errors are:. - `spread/SQRT(N)` for a non-zero spread. - `1/SQRT(12*N)` for a Spread of zero and some data points. - `0` for no data points. - ‘ `G` ' - errors are:. - `spread/SQRT(N)` for a non-zero spread. - `sigma/SQRT(N)` for a spread of zero and some data points. - `0` for no data points. The option ' `i` ' is used for integer Y values with the uncertainty; of $\pm 0.5$, assuming the probability that Y takes any value between Y-0.5; and Y+0.5 is uniform (the same argument for Y uniformly distributed; between Y and Y+1). An example is an ADC measurement. The '`G`' option; is useful, if all Y variables are distributed according to some known; Gaussian of standard deviation Sigma.

Availability,"` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error.

Note that the addition between two points is **NOT** possible and the; difference between points returns a vector. #### Other Operations. Exactly as for the 3D Vectors, the following operations are allowed:. - comparison of points. - scaling and division of points with a scalar. - dot and cross product with any type of vector. ### Example: LorentzVector Classes. As in the 3D case, typedef's are defined for user convenience. and can; be used by including the header file `Math/Vector4D.h`. The following; typedef's, defined in the header file `Math/Vector4Dfwd.h`, are; available for the different instantiations of the template class; **`ROOT::Math::LorentzVector`**:. - `ROOT::Math::`**`XYZTVector`** vector based on `x`, `y`, `z`, `t`; coordinates (Cartesian) in double precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`XYZTVectorF`** vector based on `x`, `y`, `z`, `t`; coordinates (Cartesian) in float precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`PtEtaPhiEVector`** vector based on `pt(rho)`,; `eta`, `phi` and `E(t)` coordinates in double precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`PtEtaPhiMVector`** vector based on `pt(rho)`,; `eta`, `phi` and `M(t)` coordinates in double precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`PxPyPzMVector`** vector based on `px`, `py`, `pz`; and `M(mass)` coordinates in double precision. The metric used for all the LorentzVector is (`-,-,-,+`) . #### Constructors and Assignment. The following declarations are available:. ``` {.cpp}; // create an empty vector (x=0, y=0, z=0, t=0); XYZTVector v1;; // vector with x=1, y=2, z=3, t=4; XYZTVector v2(1,2,3,4);; // vector with pt=1, eta=2, phi=PI, E=5; PtEtaPhiEVector v3(1,2,PI,5);; ```.

Basic CMake usage; =================. This section explains basic aspects of CMake; which you may need in your day-to-day usage. CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as; online help accessible via the ``cmake`` executable itself. Execute ``cmake; --help`` for further help options. CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio,; or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which; build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your; build tool, CMake uses the corresponding *Generator* to create files for your; build tool (e.g., Makefiles or Visual Studio or Xcode project files). You can; explicitly specify the generator with the command line option ``-G ""Name of the; generator""``. To see a list of the available generators on your system, execute. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake --help. This will list the generator names at the end of the help text. Generators' names are case-sensitive, and may contain spaces. For this reason,; you should enter them exactly as they are listed in the ``cmake --help``; output, in quotes. For example, to generate project files specifically for; Visual Studio 12, you can execute:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12"" path/to/llvm/source/root. For a given development platform there can be more than one adequate; generator. If you use Visual Studio, ""NMake Makefiles"" is a generator you can use; for building with NMake. By default, CMake chooses the most specific generator; supported by your development environment. If you want an alternative generator,; you must tell this to CMake with the ``-G`` option. .. todo::.

There are three main options to control access to your cross-compiler:; ``--sysroot``, ``-I``, and ``-L``. The two last ones are well known,; but they're particularly important for additional libraries; and headers that are specific to your target. There are two main ways to have a cross-compiler:. #. When you have extracted your cross-compiler from a zip file into; a directory, you have to use ``--sysroot=<path>``. The path is the; root directory where you have unpacked your file, and Clang will; look for the directories ``bin``, ``lib``, ``include`` in there. In this case, your setup should be pretty much done (if no; additional headers or libraries are needed), as Clang will find; all binaries it needs (assembler, linker, etc) in there. #. When you have installed via a package manager (modern Linux; distributions have cross-compiler packages available), make; sure the target triple you set is *also* the prefix of your; cross-compiler toolchain. In this case, Clang will find the other binaries (assembler,; linker), but not always where the target headers and libraries; are. People add system-specific clues to Clang often, but as; things change, it's more likely that it won't find than the; other way around. So, here, you'll be a lot safer if you specify the include/library; directories manually (via ``-I`` and ``-L``). Target-Specific Libraries; =========================. All libraries that you compile as part of your build will be; cross-compiled to your target, and your build system will probably; find them in the right place. But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst:7050,avail,available,7050,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

You can use the :ref:`-fno-sanitize-trap=; <controlling-code-generation>` flag to cause CFI to print a diagnostic; similar to the one below before the program aborts. .. code-block:: console. bad-cast.cpp:109:7: runtime error: control flow integrity check for type 'B' failed during base-to-derived cast (vtable address 0x000000425a50); 0x000000425a50: note: vtable is of type 'A'; 00 00 00 00 f0 f1 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 5a 42 00; ^.

Our experience with manual schema evolution shows that it is easy to; make and mismatches between `Streamer` writers and readers are frequent; and increase as the number of classes increase. We recommend you use; `rootcling` generated `Streamers` whenever you can, and profit from the; automatic schema evolution. ### Building Class Definitions with the StreamerInfo. A ROOT file's `StreamerInfo `list contains the description of all; versions of all classes in the file. When a file is opened the; `StreamerInfo `is read into memory and it provides enough information to; make the file browsable. The `TStreamerInfo `enables us to recreate a; header file for the class in case the compiled class is not available.; This is done with the `TFile::MakeProject` method. It creates a; directory with the header files for the named classes and a `makefile`; to compile a shared library with the class definitions. ### Example: MakeProject. To explain the details, we use the example of the `ATLFast` project that; is a fast simulation for the ATLAS experiment. The complete source for; `ATLFast` can be down loaded at; <ftp://root.cern.ch/root/atlfast.tar.gz>. Once we compile and run; `ATLFast` we get a ROOT file called `atlfast.root`, containing the; `ATLFast` objects. When we open the file, we get a warning that the file; contains classes that are not in the dictionary. This is correct; since we did not load the class definitions. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""atlfast.root""); Warning in <TClass::TClass>: no dictionary for class TMCParticle is available; Warning in <TClass::TClass>: no dictionary for class ATLFMuon available; ```.

For an explanation on how to pass extra data to the workers safely; through the payload, see below. ### Payload: sending local files to the remote nodes. In many cases it is necessary to send some local data to the remote; workers: it is very common, for instance, to distribute a local Grid; authentication proxy on the remote workers to let them authenticate to; access a data storage. The `payload` file must be an executable generating some output that; will be prepended to the remote environment preparation. Differently; than the other environment scripts, it is not executed: instead, it is; first run, then *the output it produces will be executed*. Let's see a practical example to better understand how it works. We need; to send our Grid proxy to the master node. This is our `payload` executable script:. ``` {.bash}; #!/bin/bash; echo ""echo '`cat /tmp/x509up_u$UID | base64 | tr -d '\r\n'`'"" \; ""| base64 -d > /tmp/x509up_u\$UID""; ```.

This line will be prepended to the remote environment script and will be; executed before anything else on the remote node: it will effectively; decode the Base64 string back to the proxy file and write it into the; `/tmp` directory. Note also that the first `$UID` is not escaped and; will be substituted *locally* with your user ID *on your client; machine*, while the second one has the dollar escaped (`\$UID`) and will; be substituted *remotely* with your user ID *on the remote node*. > It is worth noting that the remote environment scripts will be sent to; > the remote node using a secure connection (SSH), thus there is no; > concern in placing sensitive user data there.

Here we present a detailed description of the `ROOT::Fit` classes and how to use them.; Using these classes instead of the interface provided directly in the ROOT data objects, like `TH1::Fit` allow are more fine control; to configure and customise the fits. For example, using these classes a combined fit of several histograms can be performed. To understand how these class work, let's go through a simple example, such as fitting an histogram. When fitting an histogram, instead of using `TH1::Fit` we will show in the following hot wo use the `ROOT::Fit` classes.; We will show how to perform the following different type of fits with the histogram data:; * a least square fit using the observed errors (Neyman chi-squared);; * a least square fit using the expected errors from the function (Pearson chi-squared);; * a binned likelihood fit;; * an extended unbinned likelihood fits, if the histogram has been set to store in the buffer the original data used to fill it. Let's go through all the steps required for performing these fits using the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class.; These steps are:; 1. Create the input fit data object.; 2. Create the input model function.; 3. Configure the fit.; 4. Perform the data fitting.; 5. Examine the result. ### Creating the input fit data. We have two types of input data, binned data (class `ROOT::Fit::BinData`) used for least square (chi-square) fits of histograms or `TGraph` objects; or un-binned data (class `ROOT::Fit::UnBinData`) used for; fitting vectors of data points (e.g. from a `TTree`). #### Using Binned data.

When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class. On; start-up, ROOT parses all files ending on `.rootmap` rootmap that are; in one of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for `MacOS`,; or `$PATH` for `Windows`). They contain class names and the library; names that the class depends on. After reading them, ROOT knows which; classes are available, and which libraries to load for them. When `TSystem::Load(""ALib"")` is called, ROOT uses this information to; determine which libraries `libALib.so` depends on. It will load these; libraries first. Otherwise, loading the requested library could cause; a system (dynamic loader) error due to unresolved symbols. ### \$ROOTSYS/tutorials. tutorials The tutorials directory contains many example example; scripts.

Now that you've created the diagnostic in the ``Diagnostic*Kinds.td`` file, you; need to write the code that detects the condition in question and emits the new; diagnostic. Various components of Clang (e.g., the preprocessor, ``Sema``,; etc.) provide a helper function named ""``Diag``"". It creates a diagnostic and; accepts the arguments, ranges, and other information that goes along with it.

If the diagnostic takes; arguments, they are specified with the ``<<`` operator: the first argument; becomes ``%0``, the second becomes ``%1``, etc. The diagnostic interface; allows you to specify arguments of many different types, including ``int`` and; ``unsigned`` for integer arguments, ``const char*`` and ``std::string`` for; string arguments, ``DeclarationName`` and ``const IdentifierInfo *`` for names,; ``QualType`` for types, etc. ``SourceRange``\ s are also specified with the; ``<<`` operator, but do not have a specific ordering requirement.

Availability,"``LD1`` would then need to be reversed with ``REV``). Most operating systems however do not run with alignment faults enabled, so this is often not an issue. Summary; -------. The following table summarises the instructions that are required to be emitted for each property mentioned above for each of the two solutions. +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------+; | | ``LDR`` layout | ``LD1`` layout |; +===============================+===============================+=====================+; | Lane ordering | ``LDR + REV`` | ``LD1`` |; +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------+; | AAPCS | ``LDR`` | ``LD1 + REV`` |; +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------+; | Alignment for strict mode | ``LDR`` / ``LD1 + REV`` | ``LD1`` |; +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------+. Neither approach is perfect, and choosing one boils down to choosing the lesser of two evils. The issue with lane ordering, it was decided, would have to change target-agnostic compiler passes and would result in a strange IR in which lane indices were reversed. It was decided that this was worse than the changes that would have to be made to support ``LD1``, so ``LD1`` was chosen as the canonical vector load instruction (and by inference, ``ST1`` for vector stores). Implementation; ==============. There are 3 parts to the implementation:. 1. Predicate ``LDR`` and ``STR`` instructions so that they are never allowed to be selected to generate vector loads and stores. The exception is one-lane vectors [1]_ - these by definition cannot have lane ordering problems so are fine to use ``LDR``/``STR``. 2. Create code generation patterns for bitconverts that create ``REV`` instructions. 3. Make sure appropriate bitconverts are created so that vector values get passed over call boundaries as 1-element vectors (which is the same as if they ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst:8734,down,down,8734,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BigEndianNEON.rst,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"a ROOT call is not owned, but before it; passes to the Python interpreter, its ""must cleanup"" bit is set if; its type is a class derived from **`TObject`**. When the object goes; out of scope on the C++ side, the Python object will change type; into an object that largely behaves like None. The strict policy differs in that it will never relinquish ownership; when passing an object as a parameter to a function. It is then up to; the developer to prevent double deletes. Choosing one or the other; policy is done by:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryStrict ); ```. for the strict policy, or for the heuristic policy:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryHeuristics ); ```. Care must be taken in the case of graphic objects: when drawn on the; current pad, a reference to the graphics is kept that `PyROOT` isn't; currently aware of, and it is up to the developer to keep at lease one; Python reference alive. See `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/pyroot/zdemo.py`; (available in the latest release) for an example. Alternatively, one can; tell python to give up ownership for individual instances:. ``` {.cpp}; o = ROOT.TObject(); ROOT.SetOwnership( o, False ) # True to own, False to release; ```. #### Memory Management by Hand. If needed, you can explicitly destroy a ROOT object that you own through; its associated **`TClass`**:. ``` {.cpp}; myobject.IsA().Destructor(myobject); ```. which will send out the deletion notification to the system (thus you do; not need to care anymore at this point about Python reference counting,; the object will go, even if it's reference count it non-zero), and free; the memory. ### Performance.

De-coupling variable locations from registers avoids difficulties involving; register allocation and optimisation, but requires additional instrumentation; when the instructions are optimised instead. Optimisations that replace; instructions with optimised versions that compute the same value must either; preserve the instruction number, or record a substitution from the old; instruction / operand number pair to the new instruction / operand pair -- see; `MachineFunction::substituteDebugValuesForInst`. If debug info maintenance is; not performed, or an instruction is eliminated as dead code, the variable; location is safely dropped and marked ""optimised out"". The exception is; instructions that are mutated rather than replaced, which always need debug info; maintenance. # Register allocator considerations. When the register allocator runs, debugging instructions do not directly refer; to any virtual registers, and thus there is no need for expensive location; maintenance during regalloc (i.e. `LiveDebugVariables`). Debug instructions are; unlinked from the function, then linked back in after register allocation; completes. The exception is `PHI` instructions: these become implicit definitions at; control flow merges once regalloc finishes, and any debug numbers attached to; `PHI` instructions are lost. To circumvent this, debug numbers of `PHI`s are; recorded at the start of register allocation (`phi-node-elimination`), then; `DBG_PHI` instructions are inserted after regalloc finishes. This requires some; maintenance of which register a variable is located in during regalloc, but at; single positions (block entry points) rather than ranges of instructions.

Availability,"a call to a; function that doesn't exist). And it means that we can't properly perform type; checks on some containing constructs, such as ``return 42 + unknownFunction()``. To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template. In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved. Among other things, this means that clang doesn't emit more errors; where a RecoveryExpr is used as a constant (e.g. array size), but also won't try; to evaluate it.

StringRef is ideal for passing simple strings around that are known to be live,; either because they are C string literals, std::string, a C array, or a; SmallVector. Each of these cases has an efficient implicit conversion to; StringRef, which doesn't result in a dynamic strlen being executed. StringRef has a few major limitations which make more powerful string containers; useful:. #. You cannot directly convert a StringRef to a 'const char*' because there is; no way to add a trailing nul (unlike the .c_str() method on various stronger; classes). #. StringRef doesn't own or keep alive the underlying string bytes.; As such it can easily lead to dangling pointers, and is not suitable for; embedding in datastructures in most cases (instead, use an std::string or; something like that). #.

Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1.

Availability,"a; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:7897,error,errors,7897,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

Internally, LLVM often promotes the width of GEP indices to machine register; width. When it does so, it will default to using sign extension (sext); operations for safety. If your source language provides information about; the range of the index, you may wish to manually extend indices to machine; register width using a zext instruction. When to specify alignment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; LLVM will always generate correct code if you don’t specify alignment, but may; generate inefficient code. For example, if you are targeting MIPS (or older; ARM ISAs) then the hardware does not handle unaligned loads and stores, and; so you will enter a trap-and-emulate path if you do a load or store with; lower-than-natural alignment. To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores.

Although simply modifying types of a local variable doesn't normally impact the; ABI, taking the address of such a modified type could create a pointer type that; has an ABI mismatch. Looking at the following example, ``int *local`` is; implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable`` and thus the type of ``&local`` is a; pointer to ``int *__bidi_indexable``.

See the usage example below on how to use this. ## Statistics; The likelihood is the central unit on the statistics side.; The `RooAbsL` class is implemented for four kinds of likelihoods: binned, unbinned, ""subsidiary"" (an optimization for numerical stability that gathers components like global observables) and ""sum"" (over multiple components of the other types), in the correspondingly named classes `RooBinnedL`, `RooUnbinnedL`, `RooSubsidiaryL` and `RooSumL`.; These classes provide a `evaluatePartition` function that allows for computing them in parallelizable chunks that can be used by the calculator classes as they see fit. On top of the likelihood classes, we also provide for convenience a likelihood builder `buildLikelihood`, as a free function in the namespace.; This function analyzes the `pdf` and automatically constructs the proper likelihood, built; up from the available `RooAbsL` subclasses. The new classes are not per se meant to be used outside of `RooMinimizer`, although they can be.; The main reason is that they do not behave as regular `RooAbsReal` objects, but have their own interface which was kept to the minimum necessary for interacting with `RooMinimizer` as an object that encodes purely the statistics concepts.; However, we do provide the `RooRealL` class, which holds a `RooAbsL` object, but does inherit from `RooAbsReal` as well, so that it can be used in contexts where you would normally use a `RooAbsReal` (like for plotting). ### Usage example: Create an unbinned likelihood object; It is possible to directly create `RooAbsL` based likelihood objects from a pdf and dataset, in this example a `RooUnbinnedL` type:; ``` {.cpp}; RooAbsPdf *pdf;; RooDataSet *data;; std::tie(pdf, data) = generate_some_unbinned_pdf_and_dataset(with, some, parameters);.

XXXInstrInfo.h:. .. code-block:: c++. #define GET_INSTRINFO_OPERAND_ENUM // For OpName enum; #include ""XXXGenInstrInfo.inc"". namespace XXX {; int16_t getNamedOperandIdx(uint16_t Opcode, uint16_t NamedIndex);; } // End namespace XXX. Instruction Operand Types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. TableGen will also generate an enumeration consisting of all named Operand; types defined in the backend, in the llvm::XXX::OpTypes namespace.; Some common immediate Operand types (for instance i8, i32, i64, f32, f64); are defined for all targets in ``include/llvm/Target/Target.td``, and are; available in each Target's OpTypes enum. Also, only named Operand types appear; in the enumeration: anonymous types are ignored.; For example, the X86 backend defines ``brtarget`` and ``brtarget8``, both; instances of the TableGen ``Operand`` class, which represent branch target; operands:. .. code-block:: text. def brtarget : Operand<OtherVT>;; def brtarget8 : Operand<OtherVT>;. This results in:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace X86 {; namespace OpTypes {; enum OperandType {; ...; brtarget,; brtarget8,; ...; i32imm,; i64imm,; ...; OPERAND_TYPE_LIST_END; } // End namespace OpTypes; } // End namespace X86. In typical TableGen fashion, to use the enum, you will need to define a; preprocessor macro:. .. code-block:: c++. #define GET_INSTRINFO_OPERAND_TYPES_ENUM // For OpTypes enum; #include ""XXXGenInstrInfo.inc"".

Writing continues as described in steps 2-5 above. ### Reading Case; The reverse process is performed on reading (e.g. `RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`, `RNTupleView` call operator). By default, the page source uses an `RClusterPool` to asynchronously read-ahead data.; When a page of a certain cluster is required, the cluster pool reads pages of _active_ columns.; For instance, if only certain fields are used (e.g., through an imposed model), only the pages of columns connected to those fields are read.; Columns can be dynamically added (e.g. during event iteration, a new field view is created in a reader).; The cluster pool reads ahead a limited number of clusters given by the _cluster bunch size_ option (default = 1).; The read-ahead uses vector reads.; For the file backend, it additionally coalesces close read requests and uses uring reads when available. The page source can be restricted to a certain entry range.; This allows for optimizing the page lists that are being read.; Additionally, it allows for optimizing the cluster pool to not read-ahead beyond the limits. #### Late model extension; Reading an RNTuple with an extended model is transparent -- i.e., no additional interface calls are required.; Internally, columns that were created as part of late model extension will have synthesized zero-initialized column ranges for the clusters that were already written before the model was extended.; In addition, pages made up of 0x00 bytes are synthesized for deferred columns in the clusters that were already (partially) filled before the model was extended.

Availability,"adhere to a set of; portability rules associated with the Support Library. Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently. The; following sections define the rules needed to fulfill this objective. Don't Include System Headers; ----------------------------. Except in ``lib/Support``, no LLVM source code should directly ``#include`` a; system header. Care has been taken to remove all such ``#includes`` from LLVM; while ``lib/Support`` was being developed. Specifically this means that header; files like ""``unistd.h``"", ""``windows.h``"", ""``stdio.h``"", and ""``string.h``""; are forbidden to be included by LLVM source code outside the implementation of; ``lib/Support``. To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the system; found in ``include/llvm/Support`` should be used. If an appropriate interface is; not available, it should be added to ``include/llvm/Support`` and implemented in; ``lib/Support`` for all supported platforms. Don't Expose System Headers; ---------------------------. The Support Library must shield LLVM from **all** system headers. To obtain; system level functionality, LLVM source must; ``#include ""llvm/Support/Thing.h""`` and nothing else. This means that; ``Thing.h`` cannot expose any system header files. This protects LLVM from; accidentally using system specific functionality and only allows it via; the ``lib/Support`` interface. Use Standard C Headers; ----------------------. The **standard** C headers (the ones beginning with ""c"") are allowed to be; exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface. These headers and the things they; declare are considered to be platform agnostic. LLVM source files may include; them directly or obtain their inclusion through ``lib/Support`` interfaces.

However, this document is *not* a ""how to"" and won't help you setting your; build system or Makefiles, nor choosing the right CMake options, etc.; Also, it does not cover all the possible options, nor does it contain; specific examples for specific architectures. For a concrete example, the; `instructions for cross-compiling LLVM itself; <https://llvm.org/docs/HowToCrossCompileLLVM.html>`_ may be of interest. After reading this document, you should be familiar with the main issues; related to cross-compilation, and what main compiler options Clang provides; for performing cross-compilation. Cross compilation issues; ========================. In GCC world, every host/target combination has its own set of binaries,; headers, libraries, etc. So, it's usually simple to download a package; with all files in, unzip to a directory and point the build system to; that compiler, that will know about its location and find all it needs to; when compiling your code.

Prerequisites; -------------. CUDA is supported since llvm 3.9. Clang currently supports CUDA 7.0 through; 12.1. If clang detects a newer CUDA version, it will issue a warning and will; attempt to use detected CUDA SDK it as if it were CUDA 12.1. Before you build CUDA code, you'll need to have installed the CUDA SDK. See; `NVIDIA's CUDA installation guide; <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html>`_ for; details. Note that clang `maynot support; <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26966>`_ the CUDA toolkit as installed by; some Linux package managers. Clang does attempt to deal with specific details of; CUDA installation on a handful of common Linux distributions, but in general the; most reliable way to make it work is to install CUDA in a single directory from; NVIDIA's `.run` package and specify its location via `--cuda-path=...` argument. CUDA compilation is supported on Linux. Compilation on MacOS and Windows may or; may not work and currently have no maintainers. Invoking clang; --------------. Invoking clang for CUDA compilation works similarly to compiling regular C++.; You just need to be aware of a few additional flags. You can use `this <https://gist.github.com/855e277884eb6b388cd2f00d956c2fd4>`_; program as a toy example. Save it as ``axpy.cu``.

We give it the data type that we parse; into, the last argument to the ``parse`` method, so that clients of our custom; parser know what object type to pass in to the parse method. (Here we declare; that we parse into '``unsigned``' variables.). For most purposes, the only method that must be implemented in a custom parser; is the ``parse`` method. The ``parse`` method is called whenever the option is; invoked, passing in the option itself, the option name, the string to parse, and; a reference to a return value. If the string to parse is not well-formed, the; parser should output an error message and return true. Otherwise it should; return false and set '``Val``' to the parsed value. In our example, we; implement ``parse`` as:. .. code-block:: c++. bool FileSizeParser::parse(cl::Option &O, StringRef ArgName,; const std::string &Arg, unsigned &Val) {; const char *ArgStart = Arg.c_str();; char *End;. // Parse integer part, leaving 'End' pointing to the first non-integer char; Val = (unsigned)strtol(ArgStart, &End, 0);. while (1) {; switch (*End++) {; case 0: return false; // No error; case 'i': // Ignore the 'i' in KiB if people use that; case 'b': case 'B': // Ignore B suffix; break;. case 'g': case 'G': Val *= 1024*1024*1024; break;; case 'm': case 'M': Val *= 1024*1024; break;; case 'k': case 'K': Val *= 1024; break;. default:; // Print an error message if unrecognized character!; return O.error(""'"" + Arg + ""' value invalid for file size argument!"");; }; }; }.

By default, the; CommandLine library uses an instance of ``parser<type>`` if the command line; option specifies that it uses values of type '``type``'. Because of this,; custom option processing is specified with specializations of the '``parser``'; class. The CommandLine library provides the following builtin parser specializations,; which are sufficient for most applications.

See the; `Writing a Custom Parser`_ for more details on this type of library extension. .. _enums:; .. _cl::parser:. * The generic ``parser<t>`` parser can be used to map strings values to any data; type, through the use of the `cl::values`_ property, which specifies the; mapping information.

Despite this, however, the generic parser class; can be used for any data type. .. _boolean flags:; .. _bool parser:. * The **parser<bool> specialization** is used to convert boolean strings to a; boolean value.

Success values are considered checked once they have been tested (by invoking; the boolean conversion operator):. .. code-block:: c++. if (auto Err = mayFail(...)); return Err; // Failure value - move error to caller. // Safe to continue: Err was checked. In contrast, the following code will always cause an abort, even if ``mayFail``; returns a success value:. .. code-block:: c++. mayFail();; // Program will always abort here, even if mayFail() returns Success, since; // the value is not checked. Failure values are considered checked once a handler for the error type has; been activated:. .. code-block:: c++. handleErrors(; processFormattedFile(...),; [](const BadFileFormat &BFF) {; report(""Unable to process "" + BFF.Path + "": bad format"");; },; [](const FileNotFound &FNF) {; report(""File not found "" + FNF.Path);; });. The ``handleErrors`` function takes an error as its first argument, followed by; a variadic list of ""handlers"", each of which must be a callable type (a; function, lambda, or class with a call operator) with one argument. The; ``handleErrors`` function will visit each handler in the sequence and check its; argument type against the dynamic type of the error, running the first handler; that matches. This is the same decision process that is used decide which catch; clause to run for a C++ exception. Since the list of handlers passed to ``handleErrors`` may not cover every error; type that can occur, the ``handleErrors`` function also returns an Error value; that must be checked or propagated. If the error value that is passed to; ``handleErrors`` does not match any of the handlers it will be returned from; handleErrors. Idiomatic use of ``handleErrors`` thus looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. if (auto Err =; handleErrors(; processFormattedFile(...),; [](const BadFileFormat &BFF) {; report(""Unable to process "" + BFF.Path + "": bad format"");; },; [](const FileNotFound &FNF) {; report(""File not foun",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:24305,error,error,24305,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['error'],['error']

The algorithm for finding the positive and negative $\mbox{MINOS}$; errors for parameter $\mbox{n}$ consists of varying parameter; $\mbox{n}$, each time minimizing $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to; all the other $\mbox{npar - 1}$ variable parameters, to find; numerically the two values of parameter $\mbox{n}$ for which the; minimum of $\mbox{FCN}$ takes on the values; $\displaystyle F_{\mathrm{min}} + \mbox{up}$, where; $\displaystyle F_{\mathrm{min}}$ is the minimum of $\mbox{FCN}$ with; respect to all $\mbox{npar}$ parameters.

To support target-specific calling conventions, ``XXXGenCallingConv.td`` uses; interfaces (such as ``CCIfType`` and ``CCAssignToReg``) that are defined in; ``lib/Target/TargetCallingConv.td``. TableGen can take the target descriptor; file ``XXXGenCallingConv.td`` and generate the header file; ``XXXGenCallingConv.inc``, which is typically included in; ``XXXISelLowering.cpp``. You can use the interfaces in; ``TargetCallingConv.td`` to specify:. * The order of parameter allocation. * Where parameters and return values are placed (that is, on the stack or in; registers). * Which registers may be used. * Whether the caller or callee unwinds the stack. The following example demonstrates the use of the ``CCIfType`` and; ``CCAssignToReg`` interfaces. If the ``CCIfType`` predicate is true (that is,; if the current argument is of type ``f32`` or ``f64``), then the action is; performed. In this case, the ``CCAssignToReg`` action assigns the argument; value to the first available register: either ``R0`` or ``R1``. .. code-block:: text. CCIfType<[f32,f64], CCAssignToReg<[R0, R1]>>. ``SparcCallingConv.td`` contains definitions for a target-specific return-value; calling convention (``RetCC_Sparc32``) and a basic 32-bit C calling convention; (``CC_Sparc32``). The definition of ``RetCC_Sparc32`` (shown below) indicates; which registers are used for specified scalar return types.

For example ``.legalFor({s16, s32})`` declares the; instruction legal if type 0 is either s16 or s32. Additional versions for two; and three type indices are generally available. For these, all the type; indices considered together must match all the types in one of the tuples. So; ``.legalFor({{s16, s32}, {s32, s64}})`` will only accept ``{s16, s32}``, or; ``{s32, s64}`` but will not accept ``{s16, s64}``. * ``legalForTypesWithMemSize()``, ``narrowScalarForTypesWithMemSize()``, etc. are; similar to ``legalFor()``, ``narrowScalarFor()``, etc. but additionally require a; MachineMemOperand to have a given size in each tuple. * ``legalForCartesianProduct()``, ``narrowScalarForCartesianProduct()``, etc. are; satisfied if each type index matches one element in each of the independent; sets.

As usual, within the block, references to captured variables become; const-qualified, as if they were references to members of a const; object. Note that this does not change the type of a variable of; reference type. For example, given a class Foo:. .. code-block:: c. Foo foo;; Foo &fooRef = foo;; Foo *fooPtr = &foo;. A Block that referenced these variables would import the variables as; const variations:. .. code-block:: c. const Foo block_foo = foo;; Foo &block_fooRef = fooRef;; Foo *const block_fooPtr = fooPtr;. Captured variables are copied into the Block at the instant of; evaluating the Block literal expression. They are also copied when; calling ``Block_copy()`` on a Block allocated on the stack. In both; cases, they are copied as if the variable were const-qualified, and; it's an error if there's no such constructor. Captured variables in Blocks on the stack are destroyed when control; leaves the compound statement that contains the Block literal; expression. Captured variables in Blocks on the heap are destroyed; when the reference count of the Block drops to zero. Variables declared as residing in ``__block`` storage may be initially; allocated in the heap or may first appear on the stack and be copied; to the heap as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation. When copied; from the stack, ``__block`` variables are copied using their normal; qualification (i.e. without adding const). In C++11, ``__block``; variables are copied as x-values if that is possible, then as l-values; if not; if both fail, it's an error. The destructor for any initial; stack-based version is called at the variable's normal end of scope.

Availability,"ally, a few OS/target pairs provide kernel-supported lock-free; atomics. ARM/Linux is an example of this: the kernel `provides; <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/kernel_user_helpers.txt>`_ a; function which on older CPUs contains a ""magically-restartable"" atomic sequence; (which looks atomic so long as there's only one CPU), and contains actual atomic; instructions on newer multicore models. This sort of functionality can typically; be provided on any architecture, if all CPUs which are missing atomic; compare-and-swap support are uniprocessor (no SMP). This is almost always the; case. The only common architecture without that property is SPARC -- SPARCV8 SMP; systems were common, yet it doesn't support any sort of compare-and-swap; operation. Some targets (like RISCV) support a ``+forced-atomics`` target feature, which; enables the use of lock-free atomics even if LLVM is not aware of any specific; OS support for them. In this case, the user is responsible for ensuring that; necessary ``__sync_*`` implementations are available. Code using; ``+forced-atomics`` is ABI-incompatible with code not using the feature, if; atomic variables cross the ABI boundary. In either of these cases, the Target in LLVM can claim support for atomics of an; appropriate size, and then implement some subset of the operations via libcalls; to a ``__sync_*`` function. Such functions *must* not use locks in their; implementation, because unlike the ``__atomic_*`` routines used by; AtomicExpandPass, these may be mixed-and-matched with native instructions by the; target lowering. Further, these routines do not need to be shared, as they are stateless. So,; there is no issue with having multiple copies included in one binary. Thus,; typically these routines are implemented by the statically-linked compiler; runtime support library. LLVM will emit a call to an appropriate ``__sync_*`` routine if the target; ISelLowering code has set the corresponding ``ATOMIC_CMPXCHG``, ``ATOMIC_SWAP`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:28029,avail,available,28029,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail. Link graph construction utilities (especially parsers; for object formats) are encouraged to validate input, and validate fixups; (e.g. with range checks) before application. Any error will halt the link process and notify the context of failure. In ORC,; reported failures are propagated to queries pending on definitions provided by; the failing link, and also through edges of the dependence graph to any queries; waiting on dependent symbols. .. _connection_to_orc_runtime:. Connection to the ORC Runtime; =============================. The ORC Runtime (currently under development) aims to provide runtime support; for advanced JIT features, including object format features that require; non-trivial action in the executor (e.g. running initializers, managing thread; local storage, registering with language runtimes, etc.). ORC Runtime support for object format features typically requires cooperation; between the runtime (which executes in the executor process) and JITLink (which; runs in the JIT process and can inspect LinkGraphs to determine what actions; must be taken in the executor).

This includes both the location of; the bug in the program and the program's state when the location is reached. These are; both encapsulated in an ExplodedNode. In order to obtain the correct ExplodedNode, a decision must be made; as to whether or not analysis can continue along the current path. This decision; is based on whether the detected bug is one that would prevent the program under; analysis from continuing. For example, leaking of a resource should not stop; analysis, as the program can continue to run after the leak. Dereferencing a; null pointer, on the other hand, should stop analysis, as there is no way for; the program to meaningfully continue after such an error. If analysis can continue, then the most recent ExplodedNode; generated by the checker can be passed to the BugReport constructor; without additional modification.

This minimization happens; via one of several methods relying heavily on the computation of derivatives; of the function with respect to its free parameters. Currently, the; computation of Numerical Derivatives is the most time-consuming component of; RooFit [^1].

Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. A bounds annotation defines an invariant for the pointer type, and the model; ensures that this invariant remains true. In the example below, pointer ``p``; annotated with ``__counted_by(count)`` must always point to a memory buffer; containing at least ``count`` elements of the pointee type. Changing the value; of ``count``, like in the example below, may violate this invariant and permit; out-of-bounds access to the pointer. To avoid this, the compiler employs; compile-time restrictions and emits run-time checks as necessary to ensure the; new count value doesn't exceed the actual length of the buffer. Section; `Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations`_ provides more details about; this programming model. .. code-block:: c. int g;. void foo(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; count++; // may violate the invariant of __counted_by; count--; // may violate the i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:3843,error,error,3843,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['error'],['error']

However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available. The first thing we must do when generating these sequences is try to analyze; the surrounding code to prove that the flags are not in fact alive or being; used. Typically, it has been set by some other instruction which just happens; to set the flags register (much like ours!) with no actual dependency. In those; cases, it is safe to directly insert these instructions. Alternatively we may; be able to move them earlier to avoid clobbering the used value. However, this may ultimately be impossible. In that case, we need to preserve; the flags around these instructions:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; pushfq; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rdx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; popfq; movl (%rcx,%rdx), %edi; ```. Using the `pushf` and `popf` instructions saves the flags register around our; inserted code, but comes at a high cost. First, we must store the flags to the; stack and reload them. Second, this causes the stack pointer to be adjusted; dynamically, requiring a frame",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:31964,alive,alive,31964,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['alive'],['alive']

Availability,"ard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible. However, no routines in the system; library should actually throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------. Implementations of the Support Library interface are separated by their general; class of operating system. Currently only Unix and Win32 classes are defined; but more could be added for other operating system classifications. To; distinguish which implementation to compile, the code in ``lib/Support`` uses; the ``LLVM_ON_UNIX`` and ``_WIN32`` ``#define",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:9261,error,error,9261,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"ard-deviation errors. When the error matrix has been calculated (for example by the successful; execution of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad::operator(), see; [api:migradop]) or HESSE (MnHesse::operator())) then the parameter; errors printed by M are the square roots of the diagonal elements of; this matrix. The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###. The M processor $\mbox{MINOS}$ (MnMinos, see [api:minos]) was; probably the first, and may still be the only, generally available; program to calculate parameter errors taking into account both parameter; correlations and non-linearities. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error intervals; are in general asymmetric, and may be expensive to calculate,; especially if there are a lot of free parameters and the problem is very; non-linear. $\mbox{MINOS}$ can only operate after",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:16884,error,errors,16884,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['errors']

This option controls whether C++ templated functions may be inlined. ``-analyzer-config c++-template-inlining=[true | false]``. Currently, template functions are considered for inlining by default. The motivation behind this option is that very generic code can be a source; of false positives, either by considering paths that the caller considers; impossible (by some unstated precondition), or by inlining some but not all; of a deep implementation of a function. c++-stdlib-inlining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This option controls whether functions from the C++ standard library, including; methods of the container classes in the Standard Template Library, should be; considered for inlining. ``-analyzer-config c++-stdlib-inlining=[true | false]``. Currently, C++ standard library functions are considered for inlining by; default. The standard library functions and the STL in particular are used ubiquitously; enough that our tolerance for false positives is even lower here. A false; positive due to poor modeling of the STL leads to a poor user experience, since; most users would not be comfortable adding assertions to system headers in order; to silence analyzer warnings. c++-container-inlining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This option controls whether constructors and destructors of ""container"" types; should be considered for inlining. ``-analyzer-config c++-container-inlining=[true | false]``. Currently, these constructors and destructors are NOT considered for inlining; by default. The current implementation of this setting checks whether a type has a member; named 'iterator' or a member named 'begin'; these names are idiomatic in C++,; with the latter specified in the C++11 standard.

Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Reads scalar values from arbitrary memory locations and gathers them into one vector. The memory locations are provided in the vector of pointers '``ptrs``'. The memory is accessed according to the provided mask. The mask holds a bit for each vector lane, and is used to prevent memory accesses to the masked-off lanes. The masked-off lanes in the result vector are taken from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is a vector of pointers which holds all memory addresses to read. The second operand is an alignment of the source addresses. It must be 0 or a power of two constant integer value. The third operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The fourth is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type, underlying type of the vector of pointers and the type of the '``passthru``' operand are the same vector types. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.gather``' intrinsic is designed for conditional reading of multiple scalar values from arbitrary memory locations in a single IR operation.

Instead, the statepoint intrinsic marks the actual site of the; safepoint or statepoint. The statepoint returns a token value (which; exists only at compile time). To get back the original return value; of the call, we use the ``gc.result`` intrinsic. To get the relocation; of each pointer in turn, we use the ``gc.relocate`` intrinsic with the; appropriate index. Note that both the ``gc.relocate`` and ``gc.result`` are; tied to the statepoint.

The packages `afs`, `chirp`, `glite`, `sapdb`, `srp` and `ios` have been removed from ROOT.; They were deprecated before, or never ported from configure, make to CMake. ### Remove GLUtesselator forward declaration from TVirtualX.h.

Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. This is an experimental feature which can be enabled by compiling ROOT with; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On`.

The long term goal of this project is to enable Clang to function as a; replacement for the `DirectXShaderCompiler (DXC); <https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/>`_ in all its supported; use cases. Accomplishing that goal will require Clang to be able to process most; existing HLSL programs with a high degree of source compatibility. Non-Goals; ---------. HLSL ASTs do not need to be compatible between DXC and Clang. We do not expect; identical code generation or that features will resemble DXC's implementation or; architecture. In fact, we explicitly expect to deviate from DXC's implementation; in key ways. Guiding Principles; ==================. This document lacks details for architectural decisions that are not yet; finalized. Our top priorities are quality, maintainability, and flexibility. In; accordance with community standards we are expecting a high level of test; coverage, and we will engineer our solutions with long term maintenance in mind.; We are also working to limit modifications to the Clang C++ code paths and; share as much functionality as possible. Architectural Direction; =======================. HLSL support in Clang is expressed as C++ minus unsupported C and C++ features.; This is different from how other Clang languages are implemented. Most languages; in Clang are additive on top of C. HLSL is not a formally or fully specified language, and while our goals require; a high level of source compatibility, implementations can vary and we have some; flexibility to be more or less permissive in some cases. For modern HLSL DXC is; the reference implementation. The HLSL effort prioritizes following similar patterns for other languages,; drivers, runtimes and targets. Specifically, We will maintain separation between; HSLS-specific code and the rest of Clang as much as possible following patterns; in use in Clang code today (i.e. ParseHL",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:1330,mainten,maintenance,1330,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']

The LLVM; integrated assembler is extremely compatible with GAS, but there are a couple of; minor places where it is more picky, particularly due to outright GAS bugs.; One specific example is that the assembler rejects ambiguous X86 instructions; that don't have suffixes. For example:. asm(""add %al, (%rax)"");; asm(""addw $4, (%rax)"");; asm(""add $4, (%rax)"");. Both clang and GAS accept the first instruction: because the first; instruction uses the 8-bit %al register as an operand, it is clear that; it is an 8-bit add. The second instruction is accepted by both because the ""w""; suffix indicates that it is a 16-bit add. The last instruction is accepted by; GAS even though there is nothing that specifies the size of the instruction (and; the assembler randomly picks a 32-bit add). Because it is ambiguous, Clang; rejects the instruction with this error message:. <inline asm>:3:1: error: ambiguous instructions require an explicit suffix (could be 'addb', 'addw', 'addl', or 'addq'); add $4, (%rax); ^. To fix this compatibility issue, add an explicit suffix to the instruction:; this makes your code more clear and is compatible with both GCC and Clang. Objective-C compatibility. Cast of super.

If you're certain that the error you're building will never need to be converted; to a ``std::error_code`` you can use the ``inconvertibleErrorCode()`` function:. .. code-block:: c++. createStringError(inconvertibleErrorCode(), ""Bad executable"");. This should be done only after careful consideration. If any attempt is made to; convert this error to a ``std::error_code`` it will trigger immediate program; termination. Unless you are certain that your errors will not need; interoperability you should look for an existing ``std::error_code`` that you; can convert to, and even (as painful as it is) consider introducing a new one as; a stopgap measure. ``createStringError`` can take ``printf`` style format specifiers to provide a; formatted message:. .. code-block:: c++. createStringError(errc::executable_format_error,; ""Bad executable: %s"", FileName);.

It is not in the; mandate of this package to provide complete linear algebra; functionality. It provides basic matrix and vector functions such as; matrix-matrix, matrix-vector, vector-vector operations, plus some extra; functionality for square matrices, like inversion and determinant; calculation. The inversion is based on the optimized Cramer method for; squared matrices of size up to `6x6`. The `SMatrix` package contains only header files. Normally one does not; need to build any library. In the ROOT distribution a library,; `libSmatrix` is produced with the C++ dictionary information for squared; and symmetric matrices and vectors up to dimension 7 and based on; **`Double_t`**, **`Float_t`** and **`Double32_t`**. The following; paragraphs describe the main characteristics of the matrix and vector; classes. More detailed information about the `SMatrix` classes API is; available in the; [online reference documentation](online reference documentation). ### Example: Vector Class (SVector). The template class **`ROOT::Math::SVector`** represents `n`-dimensional; vectors for objects of arbitrary type. This class has 2 template; parameters, which define at compile time, its properties: 1) type of the; contained elements (for example *float* or *double*); 2) size of the; vector. The use of this dictionary is mandatory if one want to use; `Smatrix` in Cling and with I/O. #### Creating a Vector. The following constructors are available to create a vector:. - Default constructor for a zero vector (all elements equal to zero). - Constructor (and assignment) from a vector expression, like; `v=p*q+w`. Due to the expression template technique, no temporary; objects are created in this operation. - Constructor by passing directly the elements. This is possible only; for vectors up to size 10. - Constructor from an iterator copying the data referred by the; iterator.

This assumes; that we are building libunwind and ibc++ as DLLs and statically linking libc++abi into; libc++. Other build configurations are possible, but they are not discussed here. Common CMake configuration options:; -----------------------------------. * ``-D_LIBCPP_ABI_FORCE_ITANIUM'``. Tell the libc++ headers that the Itanium C++ ABI is being used. * ``-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-lmsvcrt -llegacy_stdio_definitions -D_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE""``. Supply CRT definitions including stdio definitions that have been removed from the MS VS CRT.; We don't want the stdio functions declared inline as they will cause multiple definition; errors when the same symbols are pulled in from legacy_stdio_definitions.ib. * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install path>``. Where to install the library and headers. Building libunwind:; -------------------. * ``-DLIBUNWIND_ENABLE_SHARED=ON``; * ``-DLIBUNWIND_ENABLE_STATIC=OFF``. libunwind can be built as a DLL. It is not dependent on other projects. * ``-DLIBUNWIND_USE_COMPILER_RT=OFF``. We use the MS runtime. The CMake files will need to be edited to prevent them adding GNU specific libraries to the link line. Building libc++abi:; -------------------. * ``-DLIBCXXABI_ENABLE_SHARED=OFF``; * ``-DLIBCXXABI_ENABLE_STATIC=ON``; * ``-DLIBCXX_ENABLE_SHARED=ON'``; * ``-DLIBCXX_ENABLE_STATIC_ABI_LIBRARY=ON``.

As you observed, up to now we heavily exploited the capabilities of ROOT; for interpreting our code, more than compiling and then executing. This; is sufficient for a wide range of applications, but you might have; already asked yourself ""how can this code be compiled ?"". There are two; answers. ### Compile a Macro with ACLiC. ACLiC will create for you a compiled dynamic library for your macro,; without any effort from your side, except the insertion of the; appropriate header files in lines *5--11*. In this example, they are; already included. To generate an object library from the macro code, from inside the; interpreter type (please note the ""+""):. ``` {.cpp}; root [1] .L macro1.C+; ```. Once this operation is accomplished, the macro symbols will be available; in memory and you will be able to execute it simply by calling from; inside the interpreter:. ``` {.cpp}; root [2] macro1(); ```. ### Compile a Macro with the Compiler. A plethora of excellent compilers are available, both free and; commercial. We will refer to the `GCC` compiler in the following. In; this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and; then exploit the *root-config* tool for the automatic settings of all; the compiler flags. *root-config* is a script that comes with ROOT; it; prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with; the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an; entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the; procedure `int main();`. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into; a stand-alone application is to add the following ""dressing code"" at the; end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose; of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}; int main() ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md:9755,avail,available,9755,documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,1,['avail'],['available']

The ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` attribute on a subprogram debugger information; entry is used to specify the lanes that are conceptually active for a SIMT; thread. The execution mask may be modified to implement whole or quad wavefront mode; operations. For example, all lanes may need to temporarily be made active to; execute a whole wavefront operation. Such regions would save the ``EXEC`` mask,; update it to enable the necessary lanes, perform the operations, and then; restore the ``EXEC`` mask from the saved value. While executing the whole; wavefront region, the conceptual execution mask is the saved value, not the; ``EXEC`` value. This is handled by defining an artificial variable for the active lane mask. The; active lane mask artificial variable would be the actual ``EXEC`` mask for; normal regions, and the saved execution mask for regions where the mask is; temporarily updated. The location list expression created for this artificial; variable is used to define the value of the ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane``; attribute. ``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation``; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. For AMDGPU, the ``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation`` attribute of a compilation unit; debugger information entry has the following value for the augmentation string:. ::. [amdgpu:v0.0].

The argument ``test`` is a; bit mask where each bit specifies floating-point class to test. For example, the; value 0x108 makes test for normal value, - bits 3 and 8 in it are set, which; means that the function returns ``true`` if ``op`` is a positive or negative; normal value. The function never raises floating-point exceptions. The; function does not canonicalize its input value and does not depend; on the floating-point environment.

With the CommandLine library, this is represented like; this:. .. _scalars arguments:; .. _here:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> OutputFilename(""o"", cl::desc(""Specify output filename""), cl::value_desc(""filename""));. This declares a global variable ""``OutputFilename``"" that is used to capture the; result of the ""``o``"" argument (first parameter). We specify that this is a; simple scalar option by using the ""``cl::opt``"" template (as opposed to the; ""``cl::list``"" template), and tell the CommandLine library that the data; type that we are parsing is a string. The second and third parameters (which are optional) are used to specify what to; output for the ""``-help``"" option. In this case, we get a line that looks like; this:. ::. USAGE: compiler [options]. OPTIONS:; -h - Alias for -help; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -o <filename> - Specify output filename.

Availability,"atter Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses. Gather and scatter also employ a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off. The memory addresses corresponding to the ""off"" lanes are not accessed. When all bits are off, no memory is accessed. .. _int_mgather:. '``llvm.masked.gather.*``' Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Syntax:; """"""""""""""; This is an overloaded intrinsic.

Error handling; --------------. Proper error handling helps us identify bugs in our code, and helps end-users; understand errors in their tool usage. Errors fall into two broad categories:; *programmatic* and *recoverable*, with different strategies for handling and; reporting. Programmatic Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Programmatic errors are violations of program invariants or API contracts, and; represent bugs within the program itself. Our aim is to document invariants, and; to abort quickly at the point of failure (providing some basic diagnostic) when; invariants are broken at runtime. The fundamental tools for handling programmatic errors are assertions and the; llvm_unreachable function. Assertions are used to express invariant conditions,; and should include a message describing the invariant:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(isPhysReg(R) && ""All virt regs should have been allocated already."");. The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unreachable(""X should be Foo or Bar here"");; }. Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:16831,failure,failure,16831,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['failure'],['failure']

Other Sequential Container options; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Other STL containers are available, such as ``std::string``. There are also various STL adapter classes such as ``std::queue``,; ``std::priority_queue``, ``std::stack``, etc. These provide simplified access; to an underlying container but don't affect the cost of the container itself. .. _ds_string:. String-like containers; ----------------------. There are a variety of ways to pass around and use strings in C and C++, and; LLVM adds a few new options to choose from. Pick the first option on this list; that will do what you need, they are ordered according to their relative cost. Note that it is generally preferred to *not* pass strings around as ``const; char*``'s. These have a number of problems, including the fact that they; cannot represent embedded nul (""\0"") characters, and do not have a length; available efficiently. The general replacement for '``const char*``' is; StringRef. For more information on choosing string containers for APIs, please see; :ref:`Passing Strings <string_apis>`. .. _dss_stringref:. llvm/ADT/StringRef.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The StringRef class is a simple value class that contains a pointer to a; character and a length, and is quite related to the :ref:`ArrayRef; <dss_arrayref>` class (but specialized for arrays of characters). Because; StringRef carries a length with it, it safely handles strings with embedded nul; characters in it, getting the length does not require a strlen call, and it even; has very convenient APIs for slicing and dicing the character range that it; represents. StringRef is ideal for passing simple strings around that are known to be live,; either because they are C string literals, std::string, a C array, or a; SmallVector.

Overloading Based on ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` Attributes; ---------------------------------------------------------------. Let ""H"", ""D"", and ""HD"" stand for ""``__host__`` functions"", ""``__device__``; functions"", and ""``__host__ __device__`` functions"", respectively. Functions; with no attributes behave the same as H. nvcc does not allow you to create H and D functions with the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: error - function ""foo"" has already been defined; __host__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. However, nvcc allows you to ""overload"" H and D functions with different; signatures:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: no error; __host__ void foo(int) {}; __device__ void foo() {}. In clang, the ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` attributes are part of a; function's signature, and so it's legal to have H and D functions with; (otherwise) the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // clang: no error; __host__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. HD functions cannot be overloaded by H or D functions with the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: error - function ""foo"" has already been defined; // clang: error - redefinition of 'foo'; __host__ __device__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. // nvcc: no error; // clang: no error; __host__ __device__ void bar(int) {}; __device__ void bar() {}. When resolving an overloaded function, clang considers the host/device; attributes of the caller and callee. These are used as a tiebreaker during; overload resolution. See `IdentifyCUDAPreference; <https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/SemaCUDA_8cpp.html>`_ for the full set of rules,; but at a high level they are:. * D functions prefer to call other Ds.

Availability,"ays (including VLAs); ------------------------------------------------------------. Arrays on function prototypes; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, arrays on function prototypes are promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to; its first element (e.g., ``&arr[0]``). In ``-fbounds-safety``, arrays are also; decayed to pointers, but with the addition of an implicit bounds annotation,; which includes variable-length arrays (VLAs). As shown in the following example,; arrays on function prototypes are decalyed to corresponding ``__counted_by``; pointers. .. code-block:: c. // Function prototype: void foo(int n, int *__counted_by(n) arr);; void foo(int n, int arr[n]);. // Function prototype: void bar(int *__counted_by(10) arr);; void bar(int arr[10]);. This means the array parameters are treated as `__counted_by` pointers within; the function and callers of the function also see them as the corresponding; `__counted_by` pointers. Incomplete arrays on function prototypes will cause a compiler error unless it; has ``__counted_by`` annotation in its bracket. .. code-block:: c. void f1(int n, int arr[]); // error. void f3(int n, int arr[__counted_by(n)]); // ok. void f2(int n, int arr[n]); // ok, decays to int *__counted_by(n). void f4(int n, int *__counted_by(n) arr); // ok. void f5(int n, int *arr); // ok, but decays to int *__single,; // and cannot be used for pointer arithmetic. Array references; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C, similar to arrays on the function prototypes, a reference to array is; automatically promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to its first element (e.g.,; ``&arr[0]``). In `-fbounds-safety`, array references are promoted to ``__bidi_indexable``; pointers which contain the upper and lower bounds of the array, with the; equivalent of ``&arr[0]`` serving as the lower bound and ``&arr[array_size]``; (or one past the last element) serving as the upper bound.

Availability,"b = 0;; string s = ""Hello"";; }; ------------- Defs -----------------. Here we've created a class C with integer, bit (1 or 0) and string members. See [here](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.html#types) for a full list of types. Note that you do not have to give a member a default value, it can be left uninitialised. ```tablegen; %noreset. def X: C {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; int a = ?;; bit b = 0;; string s = ""Hello"";; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def X {	// C; int a = ?;; bit b = 0;; string s = ""Hello"";; }. When you make an instance of a class using `def`, that instance gets all the members of the class. Their values will be as set in the class, unless otherwise overridden. In the case of `a` it also keeps the undefined value. Any backend using that definition would have to check for that case. ```tablegen; %noreset. def Y {; int a = ""abc""; }; ```. <stdin>:10:13: error: Field 'a' of type 'int' is incompatible with value '""abc""' of type 'string'; int a = ""abc""; ^; <stdin>:11:1: error: expected ';' after declaration; }; ^. Here we see the type checking in action. Member `a` has type `int` so we cannot assign a `string` to it. ## Let. If we want to override those member values we can use `let` ([documented here](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.html#let-override-fields-in-classes-or-records)). This can be done in a couple of ways. The first is where you mark the scope of the `let` using `in {}`. `let <name>=<value> in {`. The code below says that within the `{}` after the `let`, all `a` should have the value 5. ```tablegen; class C {; int a = 9;; }; let a=5 in {; def X: C {}; }; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; int a = 9;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def X {	// C; int a = 5;; }.

M always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter; errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they; are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization,; these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the; user. After a $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ or $\mbox{HESSE}$ step, the errors; are usually quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. If no; mitigating adjective is given in the printout of the errors, then at; least M believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a; small chance that M has been fooled. Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been specified. - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).\; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parametrized so that individual errors are not; very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit. This condition, signalled by a M warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable. See section [answer:right-errors], *Getting the right; parameter errors with limits*. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors, is to use; ""independent"" calculations and compare them, or compare the calculated; errors with a picture of the function if possible.

Using ExitOnError to simplify tool code; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Library code should never call ``exit`` for a recoverable error, however in tool; code (especially command line tools) this can be a reasonable approach. Calling; ``exit`` upon encountering an error dramatically simplifies control flow as the; error no longer needs to be propagated up the stack. This allows code to be; written in straight-line style, as long as each fallible call is wrapped in a; check and call to exit. The ``ExitOnError`` class supports this pattern by; providing call operators that inspect ``Error`` values, stripping the error away; in the success case and logging to ``stderr`` then exiting in the failure case. To use this class, declare a global ``ExitOnError`` variable in your program:. .. code-block:: c++. ExitOnError ExitOnErr;. Calls to fallible functions can then be wrapped with a call to ``ExitOnErr``,; turning them into non-failing calls:. .. code-block:: c++.

A ROOT file's `StreamerInfo `list contains the description of all; versions of all classes in the file. When a file is opened the; `StreamerInfo `is read into memory and it provides enough information to; make the file browsable. The `TStreamerInfo `enables us to recreate a; header file for the class in case the compiled class is not available.; This is done with the `TFile::MakeProject` method. It creates a; directory with the header files for the named classes and a `makefile`; to compile a shared library with the class definitions. ### Example: MakeProject.

The complete source for; `ATLFast` can be down loaded at; <ftp://root.cern.ch/root/atlfast.tar.gz>. Once we compile and run; `ATLFast` we get a ROOT file called `atlfast.root`, containing the; `ATLFast` objects.

Availability,"between; vectors of different coordinate systems like global or local vectors.; The coordinate system tag is a template parameter of the; **`ROOT::Math::`**`DisplacementVector3D` and; `ROOT::Math::PositionVector3D` (and also for 2D classes). A default tag; exists for users who do not need this functionality,; `ROOT::Math::DefaultCoordinateSystemTag`. #### Transformations. The transformations are modeled using simple (non-template) classes,; using double as the scalar type to avoid too large numerical errors. The; transformations are grouped in rotations (in 3 dimensions), Lorentz; transformations and Poincare transformations, which are; translation`/`rotation combinations. Each group has several members; which may model physically equivalent transformations but with different; internal representations. Transformation classes can operate on all type; of vectors by using the operator `() `or the operator `*` and the; transformations can be combined via the operator `*`. The available; transformations are:. - 3D rotation classes. - rotation described by a 3x3 matrix (**`ROOT::Math::Rotation3D`**). - rotation described by Euler angles (**`ROOT::Math::EulerAngles`**). - rotation described by a direction axis and an angle; (**`ROOT::Math::AxisAngle`**). - rotation described by a quaternion (**`ROOT::Math::Quaternion`**). - optimized rotation around `x` (**`ROOT::Math::RotationX`**), `y`; (**`ROOT::Math::RotationY`**) and `z` (**`ROOT::Math::RotationZ`**); and described by just one angle. - 3D transformation: we describe the transformations defined as a; composition between a rotation and a translation using the class; **`ROOT::Math::Transform3D`**. It is important to note that; transformations act differently on vectors and points. The vectors only; rotate, therefore when applying a transformation (rotation +; translation) on a vector, only the rotation operates while the; translation has no effect.

Availability,"ble Windows compiler driver for Windows Itanium.; A reasonable work-around is to build clang with a windows-msvc default target and; then override the triple with e.g. ""-Xclang -triple -Xclang x86_64-unknown-windows-itanium"".; The linker can be specified with: ""-fuse-ld=lld"". In the Itanium C++ ABI the first member of an object is a pointer to the vtable; for its class. The vtable is often emitted into the object file with the key function; and must be imported for classes marked dllimport. The pointers must be globally; unique. Unfortunately, the COFF/PE file format does not provide a mechanism to; store a runtime address from another DLL into this pointer (although runtime; addresses are patched into the IAT). Therefore, the compiler must emit some code,; that runs after IAT patching but before anything that might use the vtable pointers,; and sets the vtable pointer to the address from the IAT. For the special case of; the references to vtables for __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info from typeinto objects; there is no declaration available to the compiler so this can't be done. To allow; programs to link we currently rely on the -auto-import switch in LLD to auto-import; references to __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info pointers (see: https://reviews.llvm.org/D43184; for a related discussion). This allows for linking; but, code that actually uses; such fields will not work as they these will not be fixed up at runtime.

FileCheck Pseudo Numeric Variables; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes there's a need to verify output that contains line numbers of the; match file, e.g. when testing compiler diagnostics. This introduces a certain; fragility of the match file structure, as ""``CHECK:``"" lines contain absolute; line numbers in the same file, which have to be updated whenever line numbers; change due to text addition or deletion. To support this case, FileCheck expressions understand the ``@LINE`` pseudo; numeric variable which evaluates to the line number of the CHECK pattern where; it is found. This way match patterns can be put near the relevant test lines and include; relative line number references, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. // CHECK: test.cpp:[[# @LINE + 4]]:6: error: expected ';' after top level declarator; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^int a}}; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^ \^}}; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^ ;}}; int a. To support legacy uses of ``@LINE`` as a special string variable,; :program:`FileCheck` also accepts the following uses of ``@LINE`` with string; substitution block syntax: ``[[@LINE]]``, ``[[@LINE+<offset>]]`` and; ``[[@LINE-<offset>]]`` without any spaces inside the brackets and where; ``offset`` is an integer. Matching Newline Characters; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. To match newline characters in regular expressions the character class; ``[[:space:]]`` can be used. For example, the following pattern:. .. code-block:: c++. // CHECK: DW_AT_location [DW_FORM_sec_offset] ([[DLOC:0x[0-9a-f]+]]){{[[:space:]].*}}""intd"". matches output of the form (from llvm-dwarfdump):. .. code-block:: text.

Blocks are :block-term:`invoked` using function call syntax with a; list of expression parameters of types corresponding to the; declaration and returning a result type also according to the; declaration. Given:. .. code-block:: c. int (^x)(char);; void (^z)(void);; int (^(*y))(char) = &x;. the following are all legal Block invocations:. .. code-block:: c. x('a');; (*y)('a');; (true ? x : *y)('a'). The Copy and Release Operations; ===============================. The compiler and runtime provide :block-term:`copy` and; :block-term:`release` operations for Block references that create and,; in matched use, release allocated storage for referenced Blocks. The copy operation ``Block_copy()`` is styled as a function that takes; an arbitrary Block reference and returns a Block reference of the same; type. The release operation, ``Block_release()``, is styled as a; function that takes an arbitrary Block reference and, if dynamically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable.

This means that, with effort, the LLVM; optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code. * LLVM debug information does not prevent optimizations from; happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,; tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining), but you might lose the ability to modify the program; and call functions which were optimized out of the program, or inlined away; completely.

Availability,"bling various IDE features such; as syntax highlighting, cross-referencing, and so on. The; ``c-index-test`` helper program can be used to test these features. Testing; -------; All functional changes to Clang should come with test coverage demonstrating; the change in behavior. .. _verifying-diagnostics:. Verifying Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang ``-cc1`` supports the ``-verify`` command line option as a way to; validate diagnostic behavior. This option will use special comments within the; test file to verify that expected diagnostics appear in the correct source; locations. If all of the expected diagnostics match the actual output of Clang,; then the invocation will return normally. If there are discrepancies between; the expected and actual output, Clang will emit detailed information about; which expected diagnostics were not seen or which unexpected diagnostics were; seen, etc. A complete example is:. .. code-block: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify %s; int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}. If the test is run and the expected error is emitted on the expected line, the; diagnostic verifier will pass. However, if the expected error does not appear; or appears in a different location than expected, or if additional diagnostics; appear, the diagnostic verifier will fail and emit information as to why. The ``-verify`` command optionally accepts a comma-delimited list of one or; more verification prefixes that can be used to craft those special comments.; Each prefix must start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters,; hyphens, and underscores. ``-verify`` by itself is equivalent to; ``-verify=expected``, meaning that special comments will start with; ``expected``. Using different prefixes makes it easier to have separate; ``RUN:`` lines in the same test file which result in differing diagnostic; behavior. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify=foo,bar %s. int A = B; // foo-error {{use of un",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:155225,error,error,155225,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Miscompilations; ===============. If clang successfully produces an executable, but that executable doesn't run; right, this is either a bug in the code or a bug in the compiler. The first; thing to check is to make sure it is not using undefined behavior (e.g.; reading a variable before it is defined). In particular, check to see if the; program is clean under various `sanitizers; <https://github.com/google/sanitizers>`_ (e.g. ``clang; -fsanitize=undefined,address``) and `valgrind <http://valgrind.org/>`_. Many; ""LLVM bugs"" that we have chased down ended up being bugs in the program being; compiled, not LLVM. Once you determine that the program itself is not buggy, you should choose; which code generator you wish to compile the program with (e.g. LLC or the JIT); and optionally a series of LLVM passes to run. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you. It will print a message letting you know how to reproduce the; resulting error. The :doc:`OptBisect <OptBisect>` page shows an alternative method for finding; incorrect optimization passes.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. **bugpoint** narrows down the source of problems in LLVM tools and passes. It; can be used to debug three types of failures: optimizer crashes, miscompilations; by optimizers, or bad native code generation (including problems in the static; and JIT compilers). It aims to reduce large test cases to small, useful ones.; For more information on the design and inner workings of **bugpoint**, as well as; advice for using bugpoint, see :doc:`/Bugpoint` in the LLVM; distribution. OPTIONS; -------. **--additional-so** *library*. Load the dynamic shared object *library* into the test program whenever it is; run. This is useful if you are debugging programs which depend on non-LLVM; libraries (such as the X or curses libraries) to run. **--append-exit-code**\ =\ *{true,false}*. Append the test programs exit code to the output file so that a change in exit; code is considered a test failure. Defaults to false. **--args** *program args*. Pass all arguments specified after **--args** to the test program whenever it runs.; Note that if any of the *program args* start with a ""``-``"", you should use:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint [bugpoint args] --args -- [program args]. The ""``--``"" right after the **--args** option tells **bugpoint** to consider; any options starting with ""``-``"" to be part of the **--args** option, not as; options to **bugpoint** itself. **--tool-args** *tool args*. Pass all arguments specified after **--tool-args** to the LLVM tool under test; (**llc**, **lli**, etc.) whenever it runs. You should use this option in the; following way:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint [bugpoint args] --tool-args -- [tool args].

External bounds annotations; ---------------------------. Similar to internal bounds annotations, external bound annotations are described; as a typedef to their underlying pointer type in the debug info, and the bounds; are encoded as strings in the typedef’s name (e.g.,; ``__bounds_safety$counted_by:N``). Recognizing ``-fbounds-safety`` traps; -------------------------------------.

In our implementation, LLDB’s expression evaluator does not enable the; ``-fbounds-safety`` language option because it’s currently unable to fully; reconstruct the pointers with external bounds annotations, and also because the; evaluator operates in C++ mode, utilizing C++ reference types, while; ``-fbounds-safety`` does not currently support C++.

Mapping from instructions to functional units; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Instructions in a VLIW target can typically be mapped to multiple functional; units. During the process of packetizing, the compiler must be able to reason; about whether an instruction can be added to a packet. This decision can be; complex since the compiler has to examine all possible mappings of instructions; to functional units.

Idiomatic use of ``handleErrors`` thus looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. if (auto Err =; handleErrors(; processFormattedFile(...),; [](const BadFileFormat &BFF) {; report(""Unable to process "" + BFF.Path + "": bad format"");; },; [](const FileNotFound &FNF) {; report(""File not found "" + FNF.Path);; })); return Err;.

The parameter `c2` is; an optional argument that gives a relative weight between the two; histograms, and `dc` `2` is the error on this weight. This is; useful, for example, when forming an asymmetry between two; histograms from two different data sets that need to be normalized; to each other in some way. The function calculates the errors; assuming Poisson statistics on `h1` and `h2`; (that is, `dh=sqrt(h)`). In the next example we assume that `h1`; and `h2` are already filled:. ``` {.cpp}; h3 = h1->GetAsymmetry(h2);; ```. - Then `h3` is created and filled with the asymmetry between `h1`; and `h2` ; `h1` and `h2` are left intact. - Note that the user's responsibility is to manage the created; histograms. - **`TH1`**`::Reset()` - resets the bin contents and errors of a; histogram. ## Important note on returned statistics (`GetMean`, `GetStdDev`, etc.). By default, histogram statistics are computed at fill time using the; unbinned data used to update the bin content. **This means the values; returned by `GetMean`, `GetStdDev`, etc., are those of the dataset used; to fill the histogram**, not those of the binned content of the histogram; itself, **unless one of the axes has been zoomed**. (See the documentation; on `TH1::GetStats()`.) This is useful if you want to keep track of the; mean and standard deviation of the dataset you are visualizing with the histogram,; but it can lead to some unintuitive results.

Many kinds of errors have no recovery strategy, the only action that can be; taken is to report them to the user so that the user can attempt to fix the; environment. In this case representing the error as a string makes perfect; sense. LLVM provides the ``StringError`` class for this purpose.

It also provides a ``createStringError`` function to simplify; common usage of this class:. .. code-block:: c++. // These two lines of code are equivalent:; make_error<StringError>(""Bad executable"", errc::executable_format_error);; createStringError(errc::executable_format_error, ""Bad executable"");. If you're certain that the error you're building will never need to be converted; to a ``std::error_code`` you can use the ``inconvertibleErrorCode()`` function:. .. code-block:: c++. createStringError(inconvertibleErrorCode(), ""Bad executable"");. This should be done only after careful consideration. If any attempt is made to; convert this error to a ``std::error_code`` it will trigger immediate program; termination. Unless you are certain that your errors will not need; interoperability you should look for an existing ``std::error_code`` that you; can convert to, and even (as painful as it is) consider introducing a new one as; a stopgap measure. ``createStringError`` can take ``printf`` style format specifiers to provide a; formatted message:. .. code-block:: c++. createStringError(errc::executable_format_error,; ""Bad executable: %s"", FileName);.

Availability,"cantfail:. Using cantFail to simplify safe callsites; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Some functions may only fail for a subset of their inputs, so calls using known; safe inputs can be assumed to succeed. The cantFail functions encapsulate this by wrapping an assertion that their; argument is a success value and, in the case of Expected<T>, unwrapping the; T value:. .. code-block:: c++. Error onlyFailsForSomeXValues(int X);; Expected<int> onlyFailsForSomeXValues2(int X);. void foo() {; cantFail(onlyFailsForSomeXValues(KnownSafeValue));; int Y = cantFail(onlyFailsForSomeXValues2(KnownSafeValue));; ...; }. Like the ExitOnError utility, cantFail simplifies control flow. Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments.

Availability,"cases as well - just start an RFC thread on the; `LLVM Discourse forums`_. Adding a New Target; -------------------. LLVM is very receptive to new targets, even experimental ones, but a number of; problems can appear when adding new large portions of code, and back-ends are; normally added in bulk. New targets need the same level of support as other; *core* parts of the compiler, so they are covered in the *core tier* of our; :doc:`support policy<SupportPolicy>`. We have found that landing large pieces of new code and then trying to fix; emergent problems in-tree is problematic for a variety of reasons. For these; reasons, new targets are *always* added as *experimental* until they can be; proven stable, and later moved to non-experimental. The differences between both classes are:. * Experimental targets are not built by default (they need to be explicitly; enabled at CMake time). * Test failures, bugs, and build breakages that only appear when the; experimental target is enabled, caused by changes unrelated to the target, are; the responsibility of the community behind the target to fix. The basic rules for a back-end to be upstreamed in **experimental** mode are:. * Every target must have a :ref:`code owner<code owners>`. The `CODE_OWNERS.TXT`; file has to be updated as part of the first merge. The code owner makes sure; that changes to the target get reviewed and steers the overall effort. * There must be an active community behind the target. This community; will help maintain the target by providing buildbots, fixing; bugs, answering the LLVM community's questions and making sure the new; target doesn't break any of the other targets, or generic code. This; behavior is expected to continue throughout the lifetime of the; target's code. * The code must be free of contentious issues, for example, large; changes in how the IR behaves or should be formed by the front-ends,; unless agreed by the majority of the community via refactoring of the; (:doc:`IR standard<L",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:39521,failure,failures,39521,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['failure'],['failures']

Except for cppyy-cling, the structure in the repositories follows a normal; PyPA package and they are thus ready to build with `setuptools`_: simply; clone the package and either run ``python setup.py``, or use ``pip``. It is highly recommended to follow the dependency chain when manually; upgrading packages individually (i.e. ``cppyy-cling``, ``cppyy-backend``,; ``CPyCppyy`` if on CPython, and then finally ``cppyy``), because upstream; packages expose headers that are used by the ones downstream.; Of course, if only building for a patch/point release, there is no need to; re-install the full chain (or follow the order).; Always run the local updates from the package directories (i.e. where the; ``setup.py`` file is located), as some tools rely on the package structure.

However, if a test has a complex set of; substitutions that can all reference each other, there might not exist a; sufficient substitution order. To address such use cases, lit configuration files support; ``config.recursiveExpansionLimit``, which can be set to a non-negative integer; to specify the maximum number of passes through the substitution list. Thus, in; the above example, setting the limit to 2 would cause lit to make a second pass; that expands ``%{inner}`` in the ``RUN:`` line, and the output from the ``echo``; command when then be:. .. code-block:: shell. expanded. To improve performance, lit will stop making passes when it notices the ``RUN:``; line has stopped changing. In the above example, setting the limit higher than; 2 is thus harmless. To facilitate debugging, after reaching the limit, lit will make one extra pass; and report an error if the ``RUN:`` line changes again.

Currently, there are 2 modes:. * ``DynamicDispatchModeInlined`` - Models the case where the dynamic type information; of the receiver (MemoryRegion) is assumed to be perfectly constrained so; that a given definition of a method is expected to be the code actually; called. When this mode is set, ExprEngine uses the Decl from; RuntimeDefinition to inline any dynamically dispatched call sent to this; receiver because the function definition is considered to be fully resolved. * ``DynamicDispatchModeConservative`` - Models the case where the dynamic type; information is assumed to be incorrect, for example, implies that the method; definition is overridden in a subclass. In such cases, ExprEngine does not; inline the methods sent to the receiver (MemoryRegion), even if a candidate; definition is available. This mode is conservative about simulating the; effects of a call. Going forward along the symbolic execution path, ExprEngine consults the mode; of the receiver's MemRegion to make decisions on whether the calls should be; inlined or not, which ensures that there is at most one split per region. At a high level, ""bifurcation mode"" allows for increased semantic coverage in; cases where the parent method contains code which is only executed when the; class is subclassed.

Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures).

During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous. We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context. When an error happens, that propagates through the call stack, through all the; dependant nodes. However, in case of dependency cycles, this is not enough,; because we strive to mark the erroneous nodes so clients can act upon. In those; cases, we have to keep track of the errors for those nodes which are; intermediate nodes of a cycle. An **import path** is the list of the AST nodes which we visit during an Import; call.

Availability,"class automatically; available, such that it can be used directly. Otherwise, a; `gROOT->GetClass()` call is required first. #### Callbacks. The simplest way of setting a callback to Python from Cling, e.g. for a; button, is by providing the execution string. See for example; `tutorials/pyroot/demo.py` that comes with the ROOT installation:. ``` {.cpp}; # [..]; bar = ROOT.TControlBar('vertical','Demos'); bar.AddButton('Help on Demos',r'TPython::Exec(""execfile('demoshelp.py')"");','Click Here For Help on Running the Demos'); bar.AddButton('browser',r'TPython::Exec(""b = Tbrowser()"");','Start the ROOT browser'); # [..]; ```. Here, the callback is a string that will be interpreted by Cling to call; `TPython::Exec()`, which will, in turn, interpret and execute the string; given to it. Note the use of raw strings (the '`r`' in front of the; second argument string), in order to remove the need of escaping the; backslashes. #### Cling Commands. In interactive mode, the Python exception hook is used to mimic some of; the Cling commands available. These are: `.q`, **`.!`**, **`.x`**,; **`.L`**, **`.cd`**, **`.ls`**, **`.pwd`**, **`.?`** and **`.help`**.; Note that **`.x`** translates to Python '`execfile()`' and thus accepts; only Python files, not Cling macros. ### Memory Handling. The Python interpreter handles memory for the user by employing; reference counting and a garbage collector (for new-style objects, which; includes `PyROOT` objects). In C++, however, memory handling is done; either by hand, or by an application specific, customized mechanism (as; is done in ROOT). Although `PyROOT` is made aware of ROOT memory; management, there are still a few boundary conditions that need to be; dealt with by hand. Also, the heuristics that `PyROOT` employs to deal; with memory management are not infallible. An understanding in some; detail of the choices that are made is thus important. #### Automatic Memory Management. There are two global policies that can be set: heuristics a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:19261,avail,available,19261,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['avail'],['available']

For now, we do not; have an official policy on how one gets elected to be a code owner. .. _include a testcase:. Test Cases; ----------. Developers are required to create test cases for any bugs fixed and any new; features added. Some tips for getting your testcase approved:. * All feature and regression test cases are added to the ``llvm/test``; directory. The appropriate sub-directory should be selected (see the; :doc:`Testing Guide <TestingGuide>` for details). * Test cases should be written in :doc:`LLVM assembly language <LangRef>`. * Test cases, especially for regressions, should be reduced as much as possible,; by :doc:`bugpoint <Bugpoint>` or manually. It is unacceptable to place an; entire failing program into ``llvm/test`` as this creates a *time-to-test*; burden on all developers. Please keep them short. * Avoid adding links to resources that are not available to the entire; community, such as links to private bug trackers, internal corporate; documentation, etc. Instead, add sufficient comments to the test to provide; the context behind such links. Note that llvm/test and clang/test are designed for regression and small feature; tests only. More extensive test cases (e.g., entire applications, benchmarks,; etc) should be added to the ``llvm-test`` test suite. The llvm-test suite is; for coverage (correctness, performance, etc) testing, not feature or regression; testing. Release Notes; -------------.

Error and Warning Messages; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clear diagnostic messages are important to help users identify and fix issues in; their inputs. Use succinct but correct English prose that gives the user the; context needed to understand what went wrong. Also, to match error message; styles commonly produced by other tools, start the first sentence with a; lower-case letter, and finish the last sentence without a period, if it would; end in one otherwise. Sentences which end with different punctuation, such as; ""did you forget ';'?"", should still do so. For example this is a good error message:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: section header 3 is corrupt. Size is 10 when it should be 20. This is a bad message, since it does not provide useful information and uses the; wrong style:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: Corrupt section header. As with other coding standards, individual projects, such as the Clang Static; Analyzer, may have preexisting styles that do not conform to this. If a; different formatting scheme is used consistently throughout the project, use; that style instead. Otherwise, this standard applies to all LLVM tools,; including clang, clang-tidy, and so on. If the tool or project does not have existing functions to emit warnings or; errors, use the error and warning handlers provided in ``Support/WithColor.h``; to ensure they are printed in the appropriate style, rather than printing to; stderr directly.

The STL provides several other options, such as std::multimap and; std::unordered_map. We never use containers like unordered_map because; they are generally very expensive (each insertion requires a malloc). std::multimap is useful if you want to map a key to multiple values, but has all; the drawbacks of std::map. A sorted vector or some other approach is almost; always better. .. _ds_bit:. Bit storage containers; ------------------------------------------------------------------------. There are several bit storage containers, and choosing when to use each is; relatively straightforward. One additional option is ``std::vector<bool>``: we discourage its use for two; reasons 1) the implementation in many common compilers (e.g. commonly; available versions of GCC) is extremely inefficient and 2) the C++ standards; committee is likely to deprecate this container and/or change it significantly; somehow. In any case, please don't use it. .. _dss_bitvector:. BitVector; ^^^^^^^^^. The BitVector container provides a dynamic size set of bits for manipulation.; It supports individual bit setting/testing, as well as set operations. The set; operations take time O(size of bitvector), but operations are performed one word; at a time, instead of one bit at a time. This makes the BitVector very fast for; set operations compared to other containers. Use the BitVector when you expect; the number of set bits to be high (i.e. a dense set). .. _dss_smallbitvector:. SmallBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SmallBitVector container provides the same interface as BitVector, but it is; optimized for the case where only a small number of bits, less than 25 or so,; are needed.

The number of elements read from memory is equal to the number of '1' bits in the mask. The loaded elements are positioned in the destination vector according to the sequence of '1' and '0' bits in the mask. E.g., if the mask vector is '10010001', ""expandload"" reads 3 values from memory addresses ptr, ptr+1, ptr+2 and places them in lanes 0, 3 and 7 accordingly. The masked-off lanes are filled by elements from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load. It has the same underlying type as the element of the returned vector. The second operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type.

The result of the fit is contained in the `ROOT::Fit::Result` object. A reference to the result object is obtained with the function; `Fitter::Result()`.; The `ROOT::Fit::FitResult` class provides an API for retrieving parameter values, errors, covariance and correlation matrix from the fit,; minimum chi2/likelihood values, etc... A `FitResult::Print` method is also available to print the result of the fit. The class has a self-explanatory API so, see its reference documentation for the possible information available after the fit. One extra functionality offered by `ROOT::Fit::FitResult` is the possibility to compute the confidence intervals of the function after the fit.; The function `ROOT::Fit::FitResult::GetConfidenceInterval` given an input data sets (e.g. a `BinData` object) and a confidence level value (e.g. 68%); computes the lower/upper band values of the model function at the given data points. ### TFitResult. `TFitResult` is a class deriving from `ROOT::Fit::Result` and providing in addition some convenient methods to return a; covariance or correlation matrix as a `TMatrixDSym` object. In addition `TFitResult` derives from `TNamed` and can be conveniently; stored in a file. When fitting an histogram ( a **`TH1`** object) or a graph (a `TGraph` object) it is possible to return a `TFitResult` via the `TFitResultPtr` object,; which behaves as a smart pointer to a `TFitResult`.; `TFitResultPtr` is the return object by `TH1::Fit` or `TGraph::",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:50079,avail,available,50079,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['avail'],['available']

The tolerance parameter `fTol` (a member of the base class; **`TDecompBase`**) plays a crucial role in all operations of the; decomposition classes. It gives the user a tool to monitor and steer the; operations its default value is $\varepsilon$ where $1+\varepsilon=1$. If you do not want to be bothered by the following considerations, like; in most other linear algebra packages, just set the tolerance with; `SetTol` to an arbitrary small number. The tolerance number is used by; each decomposition method to decide whether the matrix is near singular,; except of course SVD that can handle singular matrices. This will be; checked in a different way for any decomposition. For instance in LU, a; matrix is considered singular in the solving stage when a diagonal; element of the decomposed matrix is smaller than `fTol`. Here an; important point is raised. The `Decompose()` method is successful as; long no zero diagonal element is encountered. Therefore, the user could; perform decomposition and only after this step worry about the tolerance; number. If the matrix is flagged as being singular, operations with the; decomposition will fail and will return matrices or vectors that are; invalid. If one would like to monitor the tolerance parameter but not; have the code stop in case of a number smaller than `fTol`, one could; proceed as follows:. ``` {.cpp}; TVectorD b = ..;; TMatrixD a = ..;; .; TDecompLU lu(a);; Bool_t ok;; TVectorD x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; Int_t nr = 0;; while (!ok) {; lu.SetMatrix(a);; lu.SetTol(0.1*l",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/LinearAlgebra.md:40050,toler,tolerance,40050,documentation/users-guide/LinearAlgebra.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/LinearAlgebra.md,1,['toler'],['tolerance']

Availability,"d Fortran version,; with almost equivalent numerical accuracy and computational performances.; Furthermore, it contains new functionality, like the possibility to set single side parameter limits or; the FUMILI algorithm, which is an optimized method for least square and log likelihood minimizations.; The package has been originally developed by M. Winkler and F. James.; More information on the new C++ version can be found on the; MINUIT Web Site. Minuit2, originally developed in the SEAL project, is now distributed within %ROOT.; The API has been then changed in this new version to follow the %ROOT coding convention (function names starting with capital letters) and the classes have been moved inside the namespace ROOT::Minuit2.; In addition, the %ROOT distribution contains classes needed to integrate Minuit2 in the %ROOT framework. A new class has been introduced, ROOT::Minuit2::Minuit2Minimizer, which implements the interface; ROOT::Math::Minimizer. Within %ROOT, it can be instantiates also using the %ROOT plug-in manager. This class provides a convenient entry point for using Minuit2. An example of using this interface is; the %ROOT tutorial tutorials/fit/NumericalMinimization.C or; the Minuit2 test program testMinimize.cxx. A standalone version of Minuit2 (independent of %ROOT) can be downloaded from here. It does not contain the %ROOT interface and it is therefore totally independent of external packages and can be simply build using the configure script and then make. Example tests are provided in the directory test/MnSim and test/MnTutorial and they can be built with the make check command. The Minuit2 User Guide provides all the information needed for using directly (without add-on packages like %ROOT) Minuit2. References. F. James, Fortran MINUIT Reference Manual (html);; F.

Availability,"d code is then bundled and embedded in the host executables. Intel GPU Support; =================. Clang provides partial HIP support on Intel GPUs using the CHIP-Star project `<https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/chipStar>`_.; CHIP-Star implements the HIP runtime over oneAPI Level Zero or OpenCL runtime. The Clang driver uses the HIPSPV; toolchain to compile HIP device code into LLVM IR, which is subsequently translated to SPIR-V via the SPIR-V; backend or the out-of-tree LLVM-SPIRV translator. The SPIR-V is then bundled and embedded into the host executables. .. note::; While Clang does not directly provide HIP support for NVIDIA GPUs and CPUs, these platforms are supported via other means:. - NVIDIA GPUs: HIP support is offered through the HIP project `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_, which provides a header-only library for translating HIP runtime APIs into CUDA runtime APIs. The code is subsequently compiled using NVIDIA's `nvcc`. - CPUs: HIP support is available through the HIP-CPU runtime library `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP-CPU>`_. This header-only library enables CPUs to execute unmodified HIP code. Example Usage; =============. To compile a HIP program, use the following command:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ -c --offload-arch=gfx906 -xhip sample.cpp -o sample.o. The ``-xhip`` option indicates that the source is a HIP program. If the file has a ``.hip`` extension,; Clang will automatically recognize it as a HIP program:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ -c --offload-arch=gfx906 sample.hip -o sample.o. To link a HIP program, use this command:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --hip-link --offload-arch=gfx906 sample.o -o sample. In the above command, the ``--hip-link`` flag instructs Clang to link the HIP runtime library. However,; the use of this flag is unnecessary if a HIP input file is already present in your program.

Availability,"d device binary files, and a list of offload targets (not; host), and extracts the device binaries into a new archive file for each; offload target. Each resulting archive file contains all device binaries; compatible with that particular offload target. Compatibility between a; device binary in HDA and a target is based on the compatibility between their; bundle entry IDs as defined in :ref:`compatibility-bundle-entry-id`. Following cases may arise during compatibility testing:. * A binary is compatible with one or more targets: Insert the binary into the; device-specific archive of each compatible target.; * A binary is not compatible with any target: Skip the binary.; * One or more binaries are compatible with a target: Insert all binaries into; the device-specific archive of the target. The insertion need not be ordered.; * No binary is compatible with a target: If ``allow-missing-bundles`` option is; present then create an empty archive for the target. Otherwise, produce an; error without creating an archive. The created archive file does not contain an index of the symbols and device; binary files are named as <<Parent Bundle Name>-<DeviceBinary's TargetID>>,; with ':' replaced with '_'.

Availability,"d requires a working network connection. ### Experimental address sanitizer build configuration; Added a build flag `asan` that switches on address sanitizer. It's experimental, so expect problems. For example, when building with gcc,; manipulations in global variables in llvm will abort the build. Such checks can be disabled using environment variables. Check the address; sanitizer documentation or the link below for details. In clang, which allows to blacklist functions, the build will continue. See [core/sanitizer](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/core/sanitizer) for information. ### Optimization of ROOT header files. Many (but intentionally not all) unused includes were removed from ROOT header files. For instance, `#include ""TObjString.h""` and; `#include ""ThreadLocalStorage.h""` were removed from `TClass.h`. Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from; `TDirectory.h` header file . Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from `TFile.h`.; This change may cause errors during compilation of ROOT-based code. To fix it, provide missing the includes; where they are really required.; This improves compile times and reduces code inter-dependency; see https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md for a good overview of the motivation. Even more includes will be ""hidden"" when ROOT configured with `-Ddev=ON` build option.; In that case ROOT uses `#ifdef R__LESS_INCLUDES` to replace unused includes by class forward declarations.; Such `dev` builds can be used to verify that ROOT-based code really includes all necessary ROOT headers. ## RDataFrame. - Starting from this version, when `RSnapshotOptions.fMode` is `""UPDATE""` (i.e. the output file is opened in ""UPDATE""; mode), Snapshot will refuse to write out a TTree if one with the same name is already present in the output file.; Users can set the new flag `RSnapshotOption::fOverwriteIfExists` to `true` to force the deletion of the TTree that is; already present and the wri",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md:8565,error,errors,8565,README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"d result types`:. * class methods in the ``alloc`` and ``new`` method families; * instance methods in the ``init`` family; * the instance method ``self``; * outside of ARC, the instance methods ``retain`` and ``autorelease``. If the formal result type of such a method is ``id`` or protocol-qualified; ``id``, or a type equal to the declaring class or a superclass, then it is said; to have a related result type. In this case, when invoked in an explicit; message send, it is assumed to return a type related to the type of the; receiver:. * if it is a class method, and the receiver is a class name ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T*``; otherwise; * if it is an instance method, and the receiver has type ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T``; otherwise; * the message send expression has the normal result type of the method. This is a new rule of the Objective-C language and applies outside of ARC. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC's automatic code emission is more prone than most code to signature; errors, i.e. errors where a call was emitted against one method signature,; but the implementing method has an incompatible signature.

The [detailed instructions](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/) are available.; In upcoming releases the classic method will slowly be deprecated in favor of the CMake one. ## Core Libraries. ### Cling vs CINT. Cling follows the C++ standard much more strictly than CINT. In; particular some code that used to run with CINT will either issue new; warnings or new compilation errors. For example when CINT was parsing; Namespace::%Symbol it would not only apply the C++ search rules but also; search in the outer scopes and for this example could actually return; ::%Symbol instead of (as Cling now does) issuing a compilation error. #### Template class names; Cling no longer supports refering to a class template instantiation of a; class template that has all default template parameter without the \<\>.; With:. ``` {.cpp}; template <typename T = int> class templt {};; ```. With Cling (and any standard compliant compiler), using `*templt<>*` is; allowed (but `*templt*` is not). #### Namespace prefix of template parameters; Given `namespace N { class A; template <typename T> class B;}`, the name; `N::B<N::A>` is no longer ""shortened"" to `N::B<A>`. This affects the forward; and backward compatibility of files. #### Implicit dynamic up-casts; CINT would perform automatic upcasts to derived classes under certain contex",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/doc/v600/index.md:2539,error,errors,2539,core/doc/v600/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/doc/v600/index.md,1,['error'],['errors']

Warn about an unusable copy constructor when binding a reference to a; temporary. This option enables warnings about binding a; reference to a temporary when the temporary doesn't have a usable; copy constructor. For example:. ::. struct NonCopyable {; NonCopyable();; private:; NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&);; };; void foo(const NonCopyable&);; void bar() {; foo(NonCopyable()); // Disallowed in C++98; allowed in C++11.; }. ::. struct NonCopyable2 {; NonCopyable2();; NonCopyable2(NonCopyable2&);; };; void foo(const NonCopyable2&);; void bar() {; foo(NonCopyable2()); // Disallowed in C++98; allowed in C++11.; }. Note that if ``NonCopyable2::NonCopyable2()`` has a default argument; whose instantiation produces a compile error, that error will still; be a hard error in C++98 mode even if this warning is turned off.

The user tells us which flag; they want to delete, and we assume that the it's value is a given constant. For example, the user could use the tool to remove `example_flag` from this; code:. ```c++; DEFINE_FLAG(std::string, example_flag, """", ""A sample flag."");. void Example() {; bool x = GetFlag(FLAGS_example_flag).empty();; f();; if (x) {; g();; } else {; h();; }; }; ```. The tool would simplify the code to:. ```c++; void Example() {; f();; g();; }; ```. We can solve this problem with a classic constant propagation lattice combined; with symbolic evaluation. ## Example: finding inefficient usages of associative containers. Real-world code often accidentally performs repeated lookups in associative; containers:. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; xs[42]->name = ""..."";; xs[42]->title = ""..."";; ```. To find the above inefficiency we can use the available expressions analysis to; understand that `m[42]` is evaluated twice. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; Employee &e = xs[42];; e->name = ""..."";; e->title = ""..."";; ```. We can also track the `m.contains()` check in the flow condition to find; redundant checks, like in the example below. ```c++; std::map<int, Employee> xs;; if (!xs.contains(42)) {; xs.insert({42, someEmployee});; }; ```. ## Example: refactoring types that implicitly convert to each other. Refactoring one strong type to another is difficult, but the compiler can help:; once you refactor one reference to the type, the compiler will flag other places; where this information flows with type mismatch errors. Unfortunately this; strategy does not work when you are refactoring types that implicitly convert to; each other, for example, replacing `int32_t` with `int64_t`.

Error and Warning Messages; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clear diagnostic messages are important to help users identify and fix issues in; their inputs. Use succinct but correct English prose that gives the user the; context needed to understand what went wrong. Also, to match error message; styles commonly produced by other tools, start the first sentence with a; lower-case letter, and finish the last sentence without a period, if it would; end in one otherwise. Sentences which end with different punctuation, such as; ""did you forget ';'?"", should still do so. For example this is a good error message:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: section header 3 is corrupt. Size is 10 when it should be 20. This is a bad message, since it does not provide useful information and uses the; wrong style:. .. code-block:: none. error: file.o: Corrupt section header. As with other coding standards, individual projects, such as the Clang Static; Analyzer, may have preexisting styles that do not conform to this. If a; different formatting scheme is used consistently throughout the project, use; that style instead. Otherwise, this standard applies to all LLVM tools,; including clang, clang-tidy, and so on. If the tool or project does not have existing functions to emit warnings or; errors, use the error and warning handlers provided in ``Support/WithColor.h``; to ensure they are printed in the appropriate style, rather than printing to; stderr directly.

Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance.

Error foo() {; if (auto Err = mayFail()); return Err;; // Success! We can proceed.; ... For functions that can fail but need to return a value the ``Expected<T>``; utility can be used. Values of this type can be constructed with either a; ``T``, or an ``Error``. Expected<T> values are also implicitly convertible to; boolean, but with the opposite convention to ``Error``: true for success, false; for error. If success, the ``T`` value can be accessed via the dereference; operator. If failure, the ``Error`` value can be extracted using the; ``takeError()`` method. Idiomatic usage looks like:. .. code-block:: c++.

This includes native object files as well as LLVM bitcode files.; To minimize the cost to the linker in the case that all .o files are native; object files, the linker only calls ``lto_module_create()`` when a supplied; object file is found to not be a native object file. If ``lto_module_create()``; returns that the file is an LLVM bitcode file, the linker then iterates over the; module using ``lto_module_get_symbol_name()`` and; ``lto_module_get_symbol_attribute()`` to get all symbols defined and referenced.; This information is added to the linker's global symbol table. The lto* functions are all implemented in a shared object libLTO. This allows; the LLVM LTO code to be updated independently of the linker tool. On platforms; that support it, the shared object is lazily loaded. Phase 2 : Symbol Resolution; ---------------------------. In this stage, the linker resolves symbols using global symbol table. It may; report undefined symbol errors, read archive members, replace weak symbols, etc.; The linker is able to do this seamlessly even though it does not know the exact; content of input LLVM bitcode files. If dead code stripping is enabled then the; linker collects the list of live symbols. Phase 3 : Optimize Bitcode Files; --------------------------------. After symbol resolution, the linker tells the LTO shared object which symbols; are needed by native object files. In the example above, the linker reports; that only ``foo1()`` is used by native object files using; ``lto_codegen_add_must_preserve_symbol()``. Next the linker invokes the LLVM; optimizer and code generators using ``lto_codegen_compile()`` which returns a; native object file creating by merging the LLVM bitcode files and applying; various optimization passes.

It inherits; from **`TObject`**. The two data members of this class contain important; information about X11/Win32 window identifier and the connection to the; host's graphics system. Every GUI element, which derives from; **`TGObject`** has access to the **`TGClient`** via the data member; `fClient` of **`TGObject. TGClient`** creates the connection with the; host's graphics system and sets up the complete graphics system for all; widgets. ### TGWidget. The widgets base class **`TGWidget`** is typically used as a mix-in; class via multiple inheritances. Its properties are available for all; deriving widgets: **`TGButton`**, **`TGComboBox`**, **`TGTab`**,; **`TGColorPalette`**, **`TGColorPick`**, **`TGDoubleSlider`**,; **`TGListTree`**, **`TGNumberEntry`**, **`TGScrollBar`**,; **`TGShutterItem`**, **`TGTextEntry`**, **`TGSlider`**, **`TGListBox`**,; **`TGView.`**. This class has four data members keeping information about the widget id; - important for event processing, the window which handles the widget's; events, the widget status flags and the assigned command (if there is; any). The general properties of **`TGWidget`** are specified by; `SetFlags(Int_t flags)` and `ClearFlags(Int_t flags)` methods. The; status flags are: `kWidgetWantFocus`, `kWidgetHasFocus`, and; `kWidgetIsEnabled`. The method `Associate(const TGWindow* w)` - sets the; window which handles the widget events.; `SetCommand(const char* command)` - sets the command to be executed.

We could read that value from memory; as part of the conditional move instruction, however, this creates more; micro-ops and requires the load-store unit to be involved. Currently, we place; the value into a virtual register and allow the register allocator to decide; when the register pressure is sufficient to make it worth spilling to memory; and reloading. #### Hardening Loads. Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```.

Availability,"di # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking. Modern x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address.

The downside to this; philosophy is that Clang sometimes fails to process files because they; contain broken templates that are no longer used. The solution is; simple: since the code is unused, just remove it. Default initialization of const variable of a class type requires user-defined default constructor. If a class or struct has no user-defined default; constructor, C++ doesn't allow you to default construct a const; instance of it like this ([dcl.init], p9):. class Foo {; public:; // The compiler-supplied default constructor works fine, so we; // don't bother with defining one.; ...; };. void Bar() {; const Foo foo; // Error!; ...; }. To fix this, you can define a default constructor for the class:. class Foo {; public:; Foo() {}; ...; };. void Bar() {; const Foo foo; // Now the compiler is happy.; ...; }.

The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result.

The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels. Similarly, we can; defer hardening until after them as they will not in-and-of-themselves; introduce a speculative execution side-channel. This results in code sequences; that look like:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. While an addition happens to the loaded (potentially secret) value, that; doesn't leak any data and we then immediately harden it. ###### Hardening of loaded values deferred down the data-invariant expression graph. We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant. The primary goal; should be to handle multiple loads with a single hardening instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; addl 4(%rsi), %edi # Continue without leaking.; addl 8(%rsi), %edi; orl %eax, %edi # Mask out bits from all three loads.; ```. ###### Preserving the flags while hardening loaded values on Haswell, Zen, and newer processors. Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers.

For example if the file is too large and exceeds; the disk quota, or the job crashes or a batch job reaches its time limit; before the file can be closed. In these cases, it is imperative to; recover and retain as much information as possible.

If a file that has been not properly closed is opened again, it is; scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk.

To demonstrate variable locations during instruction selection, consider; the following example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @foo(i32* %addr) {; entry:; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 0, metadata !3, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !5; br label %bb1, !dbg !5. bb1: ; preds = %bb1, %entry; %bar.0 = phi i32 [ 0, %entry ], [ %add, %bb1 ]; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %bar.0, metadata !3, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !5; %addr1 = getelementptr i32, i32 *%addr, i32 1, !dbg !5; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 *%addr1, metadata !3, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !5; %loaded1 = load i32, i32* %addr1, !dbg !5; %addr2 = getelementptr i32, i32 *%addr, i32 %bar.0, !dbg !5; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 *%addr2, metadata !3, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !5; %loaded2 = load i32, i32* %addr2, !dbg !5; %add = add i32 %bar.0, 1, !dbg !5; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %ad",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:29250,avail,available,29250,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

The; :doc:`Introduction to the Clang AST <IntroductionToTheClangAST>` teaches you; how to dump a translation unit's AST into a human readable format. .. FIXME: Introduce link to ASTMatchersTutorial.html; .. FIXME: Introduce link to ASTMatchersCookbook.html. In general, the strategy to create the right matchers is:. #. Find the outermost class in Clang's AST you want to match.; #. Look at the `AST Matcher Reference <LibASTMatchersReference.html>`_ for; matchers that either match the node you're interested in or narrow down; attributes on the node.; #. Create your outer match expression. Verify that it works as expected.; #. Examine the matchers for what the next inner node you want to match is.; #. Repeat until the matcher is finished. .. _astmatchers-bind:. Binding nodes in match expressions; ----------------------------------. Matcher expressions allow you to specify which parts of the AST are interesting; for a certain task. Often you will want to then do something with the nodes; that were matched, like building source code transformations. To that end, matchers that match specific AST nodes (so called node matchers); are bindable; for example, ``recordDecl(hasName(""MyClass"")).bind(""id"")`` will; bind the matched ``recordDecl`` node to the string ""``id``"", to be later; retrieved in the `match callback; <https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1ast__matchers_1_1MatchFinder_1_1MatchCallback.html>`_. ..

Intentionally unsupported GCC extensions; ----------------------------------------. - clang does not support the gcc extension that allows variable-length; arrays in structures. This is for a few reasons: one, it is tricky to; implement, two, the extension is completely undocumented, and three,; the extension appears to be rarely used. Note that clang *does*; support flexible array members (arrays with a zero or unspecified; size at the end of a structure).; - GCC accepts many expression forms that are not valid integer constant; expressions in bit-field widths, enumerator constants, case labels,; and in array bounds at global scope. Clang also accepts additional; expression forms in these contexts, but constructs that GCC accepts due to; simplifications GCC performs while parsing, such as ``x - x`` (where ``x`` is a; variable) will likely never be accepted by Clang.; - clang does not support ``__builtin_apply`` and friends; this extension; is extremely obscure and difficult to implement reliably. .. _c_ms:. Microsoft extensions; --------------------. clang has support for many extensions from Microsoft Visual C++. To enable these; extensions, use the ``-fms-extensions`` command-line option. This is the default; for Windows targets. Clang does not implement every pragma or declspec provided; by MSVC, but the popular ones, such as ``__declspec(dllexport)`` and ``#pragma; comment(lib)`` are well supported. clang has a ``-fms-compatibility`` flag that makes clang accept enough; invalid C++ to be able to parse most Microsoft headers. For example, it; allows `unqualified lookup of dependent base class members; <https://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup_bases>`_, which is; a common compatibility issue with clang. This flag is enabled by default; for Windows targets. ``-fdelayed-template-parsing`` lets clang delay parsing of function template; definitions until the end of a translation unit.

For example, if the user specifies; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-m4`` the toolchain can choose a directory; containing headers and libraries suitable for Armv7E-M, because it knows that's; a suitable architecture for Arm Cortex-M4.; Multilib can also choose between libraries for the same architecture based on; other options. For example if the user specifies ``-fno-exceptions`` then a; toolchain could select libraries built without exception support, thereby; reducing the size of the resulting binary. Design; ======. Clang supports GCC's ``-print-multi-lib`` and ``-print-multi-directory``; options. These are described in; `GCC Developer Options <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/Developer-Options.html>`_. There are two ways to configure multilib in Clang: hard-coded or via a; configuration file. Hard-coded Multilib; ===================. The available libraries can be hard-coded in Clang. Typically this is done; using the ``MultilibBuilder`` interface in; ``clang/include/clang/Driver/MultilibBuilder.h``.; There are many examples of this in ``lib/Driver/ToolChains/Gnu.cpp``.; The remainder of this document will not focus on this type of multilib. EXPERIMENTAL Multilib via configuration file; ============================================. Some Clang toolchains support loading multilib configuration from a; ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file. A ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file specifies which multilib variants are; available, their relative location, what compilation options were used to build; them, and the criteria by which they are selected. Multilib processing; ===================. Clang goes through the following steps to use multilib from a configuration; file:. #. Normalize command line options.

The minimizer can become blocked at a limit, because at a limit the; derivative seen by the minimizer; $\partial F / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}}$ is zero no matter what the real; derivative $\partial F / \partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}$ is. $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{int}}} =; \frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}}; \frac{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}}{\partial P_{\mathrm{int}}} =; \frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}} = 0$$.

If this happens, it may be necessary to; move the value of the parameter in question a significant distance from; the limit (e.g. with MnMigrad::setValue(...)) and restart the; minimization, perhaps with that parameter fixed temporarily. ### Getting the right parameter errors with limits ###. [answer:right-errors]. In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, M will; correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; prin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:65379,error,errors,65379,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['errors']

To enable matching against desired strings that contain `}}` or `{{`, the; string-mode parser accepts opening delimiters of more than two curly braces,; like `{{{`. It then looks for a closing delimiter of equal ""width"" (i.e `}}}`).; For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // expected-note {{{evaluates to '{{2, 3, 4}} == {0, 3, 4}'}}}. The intent is to allow the delimeter to be wider than the longest `{` or `}`; brace sequence in the content, so that if your expected text contains `{{{`; (three braces) it may be delimited with `{{{{` (four braces), and so on. Regex matching mode may be selected by appending ``-re`` to the diagnostic type; and including regexes wrapped in double curly braces (`{{` and `}}`) in the; directive, such as:. .. code-block:: text. expected-error-re {{format specifies type 'wchar_t **' (aka '{{.+}}')}}.

Viewing static analyzer results in Xcode. Viewing static analyzer results in a web browser. What is Static Analysis?; The term ""static analysis"" is conflated, but here we use it to mean; a collection of algorithms and techniques used to analyze source code in order; to automatically find bugs. The idea is similar in spirit to compiler warnings; (which can be useful for finding coding errors) but to take that idea a step; further and find bugs that are traditionally found using run-time debugging; techniques such as testing.; Static analysis bug-finding tools have evolved over the last several decades; from basic syntactic checkers to those that find deep bugs by reasoning about; the semantics of code. The goal of the Clang Static Analyzer is to provide a; industrial-quality static analysis framework for analyzing C, C++, and; Objective-C programs that is freely available, extensible, and has a high quality of implementation.; Part of Clang and LLVM; As its name implies, the Clang Static Analyzer is built on top of Clang and LLVM.; Strictly speaking, the analyzer is part of Clang, as Clang consists of a set of; reusable C++ libraries for building powerful source-level tools. The static; analysis engine used by the Clang Static Analyzer is a Clang library, and has; the capability to be reused in different contexts and by different clients.; Important Points to Consider; While we believe that the static analyzer is already very useful for finding; bugs, we ask you to bear in mind a few points when using it.; Work-in-Progress; The analyzer is a continuous work-in-progress. There are many planned; enhancements to improve both the precision and scope of its analysis algorithms; as well as the kinds of bugs it will find.

If; the umbrella pulled in an upstream commit that happened to have a tag; pointing to it, that tag will be migrated, which is almost certainly; not what is wanted. The tag can always be moved back to its original; commit after rewriting, or the ``--update-tags`` option may be; discarded and any local tags would then be migrated manually. **Example 2: Nested sources layout**. The tool handles nested submodules (e.g. llvm is a submodule in; umbrella and clang is a submodule in llvm). The file; ``submodule-map.txt`` is a list of pairs, one per line. The first; pair item describes the path to a submodule in the umbrella; repository. The second pair item describes the path where trees for; that submodule should be written in the zipped history. Let's say your umbrella repository is actually the llvm repository and; it has submodules in the ""nested sources"" layout (clang in; tools/clang, etc.). Let's also say ``projects/myproj`` is a submodule; pointing to some downstream repository. The submodule map file should; look like this (we still want myproj mapped the same way as; previously)::. tools/clang clang; tools/clang/tools/extra clang-tools-extra; projects/compiler-rt compiler-rt; projects/debuginfo-tests debuginfo-tests; projects/libclc libclc; projects/libcxx libcxx; projects/libcxxabi libcxxabi; projects/libunwind libunwind; tools/lld lld; tools/lldb lldb; projects/openmp openmp; tools/polly polly; projects/myproj local/myproj. If a submodule path does not appear in the map, the tools assumes it; should be placed in the same place in the monorepo. That means if you; use the ""nested sources"" layout in your umrella, you *must* provide; map entries for all of the projects in your umbrella (except llvm).; Otherwise trees from submodule updates will appear underneath llvm in; the zippped history.

These *severities* are mapped into a smaller set (the ``Diagnostic::Level``; enum, {``Ignored``, ``Note``, ``Remark``, ``Warning``, ``Error``, ``Fatal``}) of; output; *levels* by the diagnostics subsystem based on various configuration options.; Clang internally supports a fully fine grained mapping mechanism that allows; you to map almost any diagnostic to the output level that you want. The only; diagnostics that cannot be mapped are ``NOTE``\ s, which always follow the; severity of the previously emitted diagnostic and ``ERROR``\ s, which can only; be mapped to ``Fatal`` (it is not possible to turn an error into a warning, for; example). Diagnostic mappings are used in many ways. For example, if the user specifies; ``-pedantic``, ``EXTENSION`` maps to ``Warning``, if they specify; ``-pedantic-errors``, it turns into ``Error``. This is used to implement; options like ``-Wunused_macros``, ``-Wundef`` etc. Mapping to ``Fatal`` should only be used for diagnostics that are considered so; severe that error recovery won't be able to recover sensibly from them (thus; spewing a ton of bogus errors).

It is often convenient to add additional search paths for Cling to find; headers and libraries when loading a module (Python does not have standard; locations to place headers and libraries, but their locations can usually; be inferred from the location of the module, i.e. it's ``__file__``; attribute).; cppyy provides the following two helpers:. * ``add_include_path``: add additional paths for Cling to look for headers. * ``add_library_path``: add additional paths for Cling to look for libraries.

Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:8024,error,errors,8024,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

The Fault Map Section; =====================. Information about implicit checks generated by LLVM are put in a; special ""fault map"" section. On Darwin this section is named; ``__llvm_faultmaps``. The format of this section is. .. code-block:: none. Header {; uint8 : Fault Map Version (current version is 1); uint8 : Reserved (expected to be 0); uint16 : Reserved (expected to be 0); }; uint32 : NumFunctions; FunctionInfo[NumFunctions] {; uint64 : FunctionAddress; uint32 : NumFaultingPCs; uint32 : Reserved (expected to be 0); FunctionFaultInfo[NumFaultingPCs] {; uint32 : FaultKind; uint32 : FaultingPCOffset; uint32 : HandlerPCOffset; }; }. FailtKind describes the reason of expected fault. Currently three kind; of faults are supported:. 1. ``FaultMaps::FaultingLoad`` - fault due to load from memory.; 2. ``FaultMaps::FaultingLoadStore`` - fault due to instruction load and store.; 3. ``FaultMaps::FaultingStore`` - fault due to store to memory. The ``ImplicitNullChecks`` pass; ===============================. The ``ImplicitNullChecks`` pass transforms explicit control flow for; checking if a pointer is ``null``, like:. .. code-block:: llvm. %ptr = call i32* @get_ptr(); %ptr_is_null = icmp i32* %ptr, null; br i1 %ptr_is_null, label %is_null, label %not_null, !make.implicit !0. not_null:; %t = load i32, i32* %ptr; br label %do_something_with_t. is_null:; call void @HFC(); unreachable. !0 = !{}. to control flow implicit in the instruction loading or storing through; the pointer being null checked:. .. code-block:: llvm. %ptr = call i32* @get_ptr(); %t = load i32, i32* %ptr ;; handler-pc = label %is_null; br label %do_something_with_t. is_null:; call void @HFC(); unreachable.

If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least `Minuit` believes; the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that; `Minuit` has been fooled. Some visible signs that `Minuit` may have; been fooled:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error; analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum). - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parameterized so that individual errors are; not very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit. This condition, signaled by a `Minuit` warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable. See the discussion above ‘Getting the right parameter; errors with limits'. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors is to use; ''independent'' calculations and compare them, or compare the; calculated errors with a picture of the function. Theoretically, the; covariance matrix for a ''physical'' function must be; positive-definite at the minimum, although it may not be so for all; points far away from the minimum, even for a well-determined physical; problem. Therefore, if `MIGRAD` reports that it has found a; non-positive-definite covariance matrix, this may be a sign of one or; more of the following:. #### A Non-physical Region. On its way to the minimum, `MIGRAD` may have traversed a region that; has unphysical behavior, which is of course not a serious problem as; long as it recovers and leaves such a region. #### An Underdetermined Problem.

The LLVM code base has a number of files that aren't being actively maintained.; But not all of those files are obstructing the development of the project and; so it remains in the repository with the assumption that it could still be; useful for downstream users. For code to remain in the repository, its presence must not impose an undue; burden on maintaining other components (core or peripheral). Warnings; --------. There are multiple types of issues that might trigger a request for deprecation,; including (but not limited to):. * Changes in a component consistently break other areas of the project.; * Components go broken for long periods of time (weeks or more).; * Clearly superior alternatives are in use and maintenance is painful.; * Builds and tests are harder / take longer, increasing the cost of; maintenance, overtaking the perceived benefits. If the maintenance cost is higher than it is acceptable by the majority of; developers, it means that either the sub-community is too small (and the extra; cost should be paid locally), or not active enough (and the problems won't be; fixed any time soon). In either case, removal of such problematic component is; justified. Steps for removal; -----------------. However clear the needs for removal are, we should take an incremental approach; to deprecating code, especially when there's still a sub-community that cares; about it. In that sense, code will never be removed outright without a series; of steps are taken. A minimum set of steps should be:; #.

Because we specified that the command line option should parse using the; ``string`` data type, the variable declared is automatically usable as a real; string in all contexts that a normal C++ string object may be used. For; example:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; std::ofstream Output(OutputFilename.c_str());; if (Output.good()) ...; ... There are many different options that you can use to customize the command line; option handling library, but the above example shows the general interface to; these options. The options can be specified in any order, and are specified; with helper functions like `cl::desc(...)`_, so there are no positional; dependencies to remember. The available options are discussed in detail in the; `Reference Guide`_. Continuing the example, we would like to have our compiler take an input; filename as well as an output filename, but we do not want the input filename to; be specified with a hyphen (ie, not ``-filename.c``). To support this style of; argument, the CommandLine library allows for `positional`_ arguments to be; specified for the program. These positional arguments are filled with command; line parameters that are not in option form. We use this feature like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> InputFilename(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input file>""), cl::init(""-""));. This declaration indicates that the first positional argument should be treated; as the input filename. Here we use the `cl::init`_ option to specify an initial; value for the command line option, which is used if the option is not specified; (if you do not specify a `cl::init`_ modifier for an option, then the default; constructor for the data type is used to initialize the value)",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:6484,avail,available,6484,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

The second to last entry is a list of free segments. In our case, this; starts 8976 and is not very long, only 53 bytes, since we have not; deleted any objects. The last entry is the address of the last byte in; the file. ### File Recovery. A file may become corrupted or it may be impossible to write it to disk; and close it properly. For example if the file is too large and exceeds; the disk quota, or the job crashes or a batch job reaches its time limit; before the file can be closed. In these cases, it is imperative to; recover and retain as much information as possible. ROOT provides an; intelligent and elegant file recovery mechanism using the redundant; directory information in the record header. If a file that has been not properly closed is opened again, it is; scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk.

Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail. Link graph construction utilities (especially parsers; for object formats) are encouraged to validate input, and validate fixups; (e.g. with range checks) before application.

The ORC Runtime (currently under development) aims to provide runtime support; for advanced JIT features, including object format features that require; non-trivial action in the executor (e.g. running initializers, managing thread; local storage, registering with language runtimes, etc.). ORC Runtime support for object format features typically requires cooperation; between the runtime (which executes in the executor process) and JITLink (which; runs in the JIT process and can inspect LinkGraphs to determine what actions; must be taken in the executor).

The GNU spec files standard is large and complex and there's little desire to; import that complexity to LLVM. It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver. While compatibility; with GNU would bring benefits, the cost in this case is deemed too high. Avoid re-inventing feature detection in the configuration; ---------------------------------------------------------. A large amount of logic in the Clang driver is dedicated to inferring which; architectural features are available based on the given command line options.; It is neither desirable nor practical to repeat such logic in each multilib; configuration. Instead the configuration should be able to benefit from the; heavy lifting Clang already does to detect features. Low maintenance; ---------------. Multilib is a relatively small feature in the scheme of things so supporting it; should accordingly take little time. Where possible this should be achieved by; implementing it in terms of existing features in the LLVM codebase. Minimal additional API surface; ------------------------------. The greater the API surface, the greater the difficulty of keeping it stable.; Where possible the additional API surface should be kept small by defining it; in relation to existing APIs. An example of this is keeping a simple; relationship between flag names and command line options where possible.; Since the command line options are part of a stable API they are unlikely; to change, and therefore the flag names get the same stability.

FAQ; =========================. Q. Why doesn't libFuzzer use any of the LLVM support?; -----------------------------------------------------. There are two reasons. First, we want this library to be used outside of the LLVM without users having to; build the rest of LLVM. This may sound unconvincing for many LLVM folks,; but in practice the need for building the whole LLVM frightens many potential; users -- and we want more users to use this code. Second, there is a subtle technical reason not to rely on the rest of LLVM, or; any other large body of code (maybe not even STL). When coverage instrumentation; is enabled, it will also instrument the LLVM support code which will blow up the; coverage set of the process (since the fuzzer is in-process). In other words, by; using more external dependencies we will slow down the fuzzer while the main; reason for it to exist is extreme speed. Q. Does libFuzzer Support Windows?; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Yes, libFuzzer now supports Windows. Initial support was added in r341082.; Any build of Clang 9 supports it. You can download a build of Clang for Windows; that has libFuzzer from; `LLVM Snapshot Builds <https://llvm.org/builds/>`_. Using libFuzzer on Windows without ASAN is unsupported. Building fuzzers with the; ``/MD`` (dynamic runtime library) compile option is unsupported. Support for these; may be added in the future. Linking fuzzers with the ``/INCREMENTAL`` link option; (or the ``/DEBUG`` option which implies it) is also unsupported.

Let's consider verifying usage; site conditions to be a separate static analysis problem. ### Lattice design. To analyze the function body we can use a lattice which consists of normal; states and failure states. A normal state describes program points where we are; sure that no behaviors that block the refactoring have occurred. Normal states; keep track of all parameter's member fields that are known to be overwritten on; every path from function entry to the corresponding program point. Failure; states accumulate observed violations (unsafe reads and pointer escapes) that; block the refactoring. In the partial order of the lattice failure states compare greater than normal; states, which guarantees that they ""win"" when joined with normal states. Order; between failure states is determined by inclusion relation on the set of; accumulated violations (lattice's `⩽` is `⊆` on the set of violations).

Availability,"e the bounds invariant of the destination's pointer annotation.; Type conversions that change bounds attributes may be allowed if it does not; violate the invariant of the destination or that can be verified at run time.; Here are some of the important cast rules. Two pointers that have different bounds annotations on their nested pointer; types are incompatible and cannot implicitly cast to each other. For example,; ``T *__single *__single`` cannot be converted to ``T *__bidi_indexable; *__single``. Such a conversion between incompatible nested bounds annotations; can be allowed using an explicit cast (e.g., C-style cast). Hereafter, the rules; only apply to the top pointer types. ``__unsafe_indexable`` cannot be converted; to any other safe pointer types (``__single``, ``__bidi_indexable``,; ``__counted_by``, etc) using a cast. The extension provides builtins to force; this conversion, ``__unsafe_forge_bidi_indexable(type, pointer, char_count)`` to; convert pointer to a ``__bidi_indexable`` pointer of type with ``char_count``; bytes available and ``__unsafe_forge_single(type, pointer)`` to convert pointer; to a single pointer of type type. The following examples show the usage of these; functions. Function ``example_forge_bidi()`` gets an external buffer from an; unsafe library by calling ``get_buf()`` which returns ``void; *__unsafe_indexable.`` Under the type rules, this cannot be directly assigned to; ``void *buf`` (implicitly ``void *__bidi_indexable``).

Availability,"e the requested PC sections. While relying on LLVM IR metadata to request PC sections makes the above; guarantee relatively trivial, propagation of metadata through the optimization; and code generation pipeline has the following guarantees. Metadata Propagation; --------------------. In general, LLVM *does not make any guarantees* about preserving IR metadata; (attached to an ``Instruction``) through IR transformations. When using PC; sections metadata, this guarantee is unchanged, and ``!pcsections`` metadata is; remains *optional* until lowering to machine IR (MIR). Note for Code Generation; ------------------------. As with other LLVM IR metadata, there are no requirements for LLVM IR; transformation passes to preserve ``!pcsections`` metadata, with the following; exceptions:. * The ``AtomicExpandPass`` shall preserve ``!pcsections`` metadata; according to the below rules 1-4. When translating LLVM IR to MIR, the ``!pcsections`` metadata shall be copied; from the source ``Instruction`` to the target ``MachineInstr`` (set with; ``MachineInstr::setPCSections()``). The instruction selectors and MIR; optimization passes shall preserve PC sections metadata as follows:. 1. Replacements will preserve PC sections metadata of the replaced; instruction. 2. Duplications will preserve PC sections metadata of the copied; instruction. 3. Merging will preserve PC sections metadata of one of the two; instructions (no guarantee on which instruction's metadata is used). 4. Deletions will loose PC sections metadata. This is similar to debug info, and the ``BuildMI()`` helper provides a; convenient way to propagate debug info and ``!pcsections`` metadata in the; ``MIMetadata`` bundle. Note for Metadata Users; -----------------------. Use cases for ``!pcsections`` metadata should either be fully tolerant to; missing metadata, or the passes inserting ``!pcsections`` metadata should run; *after* all LLVM IR optimization passes to preserve the metadata until being; translated to MIR.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PCSectionsMetadata.rst:4565,toler,tolerant,4565,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PCSectionsMetadata.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PCSectionsMetadata.rst,1,['toler'],['tolerant']

We must say that even the overlaps of type A) and B) are allowed in case; the corresponding nodes are created using; **`TGeoVolume`**`::AddNodeOverlap()` method. Navigation is performed in such; cases by giving priority to the non-overlapping nodes.

In both variants; of the pragma the vectorizer may decide to fall back on fixed width; vectorization if the target does not support scalable vectors.

Specifying a width/count of 1 disables the optimization, and is equivalent to; ``vectorize(disable)`` or ``interleave(disable)``. Vector predication is enabled by ``vectorize_predicate(enable)``, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop vectorize_predicate(enable); for(...) {; ...; }.

Unrolling a loop reduces the loop control overhead and exposes more; opportunities for ILP. Loops can be fully or partially unrolled. Full unrolling; eliminates the loop and replaces it with an enumerated sequence of loop; iterations. Full unrolling is only possible if the loop trip count is known at; compile time.

After talking about namespaces in general, you may be wondering about anonymous; namespaces in particular. Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature; that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible; within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and; eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. Anonymous namespaces are; to C++ as ""static"" is to C functions and global variables. While ""``static``""; is available in C++, anonymous namespaces are more general: they can make entire; classes private to a file. The problem with anonymous namespaces is that they naturally want to encourage; indentation of their body, and they reduce locality of reference: if you see a; random function definition in a C++ file, it is easy to see if it is marked; static, but seeing if it is in an anonymous namespace requires scanning a big; chunk of the file. Because of this, we have a simple guideline: make anonymous namespaces as small; as possible, and only use them for class declarations. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. namespace {; class StringSort {; ...; public:; StringSort(...); bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;; };; } // namespace. static void runHelper() {; ...; }. bool StringSort::operator<(const char *RHS) const {; ...; }.

In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a convention very reliably, at least for; system libraries on macOS, and functions always pass objects at +0.

You can see all configurations and their current state in a waterfall; view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/waterfall. The waterfall view is good; to get a general overview over the tested configurations and to see; which configuration have been broken for a while.

It has users, which are of type; VPUser, but no operands. :VPUser:; A VPUser represents an entity that uses a number of VPValues as operands.; VPUser is similar in some aspects to LLVM's User class. :VPDef:; A VPDef represents an entity that defines zero, one or multiple VPValues.; It is used to model the fact that recipes in VPlan can define multiple; VPValues. :VPInstruction:; A VPInstruction is both a VPRecipe and a VPUser. It models a single; VPlan-level instruction to be generated if the VPlan is executed, including; its opcode and possibly additional characteristics. It is the basis for; writing instruction-level analyses and optimizations in VPlan as creating,; replacing or moving VPInstructions record both def-use and scheduling; decisions. VPInstructions also extend LLVM IR's opcodes with idiomatic; operations that enrich the Vectorizer's semantics. :VPTransformState:; Stores information used for generating output IR, passed from; LoopVectorizationPlanner to its selected VPlan for execution, and used to pass; additional information down to VPBlocks and VPRecipes. The Planning Process and VPlan Roadmap; ======================================. Transforming the Loop Vectorizer to use VPlan follows a staged approach. First,; VPlan is used to record the final vectorization decisions, and to execute them:; the Hierarchical CFG models the planned control-flow, and Recipes capture; decisions taken inside basic-blocks. Next, VPlan will be used also as the basis; for taking these decisions, effectively turning them into a series of; VPlan-to-VPlan algorithms. Finally, VPlan will support the planning process; itself including cost-based analyses for making these decisions, to fully; support compositional and iterative decision making. Some decisions are local to an instruction in the loop, such as whether to widen; it into a vector instruction or replicate it, keeping the generated instructions; in place.

Similarly, if there are only two; free parameters, use $\mbox{CONTOURS}$. To verify a full error; matrix, compare the results of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ with those; (calculated afterward) by $\mbox{HESSE}$, which uses a different; method. And of course the most reliable and most expensive technique,; which must be used if asymmetric errors are required, is; $\mbox{MINOS}$. ## Convergence in $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, and positive–definiteness ##. $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ uses its current estimate of the covariance matrix; of the function to determine the current search direction, since this is; the optimal strategy for quadratic functions and ""physical"" functions; should be quadratic in the neighbourhood of the minimum at least. The; search directions determined by $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ are guaranteed to be; downhill only if the covariance matrix is positive–definite, so in case; this is not true, it makes a positive–definite approximation by adding; an appropriate constant along the diagonal as determined by the; eigenvalues of the matrix. Theoretically, the covariance matrix for a; ""physical"" function must be positive–definite at the minimum, although; it may not be so for all points far away from the minimum, even for a; well–determined physical problem. Therefore, if $\mbox{MIGRAD}$; reports that it has found a non-positive–definite covariance matrix,; this may be a sign of one or more of the following:. - **A non–physical region.** On its way to the minimum,; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ may have traversed a region which has unphysical; behaviour, which is of course not a serious problem as long as it; recovers and leaves such a region. - **An underdetermined problem.** If the matrix is not; positive–definite even at the minimum, this may mean that the; solution is not well–defined, for example that there are more; unknowns than there are data points, or that the parametrizat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:71393,down,downhill,71393,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['down'],['downhill']
Availability,"e. Moreover, the class ``MCRegAliasIterator`` enumerates all the physical; registers aliased to a register. Physical registers, in LLVM, are grouped in *Register Classes*. Elements in the; same register class are functionally equivalent, and can be interchangeably; used. Each virtual register can only be mapped to physical registers of a; particular class. For instance, in the X86 architecture, some virtuals can only; be allocated to 8 bit registers. A register class is described by; ``TargetRegisterClass`` objects. To discover if a virtual register is; compatible with a given physical, this code can be used:. .. code-block:: c++. bool RegMapping_Fer::compatible_class(MachineFunction &mf,; unsigned v_reg,; unsigned p_reg) {; assert(TargetRegisterInfo::isPhysicalRegister(p_reg) &&; ""Target register must be physical"");; const TargetRegisterClass *trc = mf.getRegInfo().getRegClass(v_reg);; return trc->contains(p_reg);; }. Sometimes, mostly for debugging purposes, it is useful to change the number of; physical registers available in the target architecture. This must be done; statically, inside the ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file. Just ``grep`` for; ``RegisterClass``, the last parameter of which is a list of registers. Just; commenting some out is one simple way to avoid them being used. A more polite; way is to explicitly exclude some registers from the *allocation order*. See the; definition of the ``GR8`` register class in; ``lib/Target/X86/X86RegisterInfo.td`` for an example of this. Virtual registers are also denoted by integer numbers. Contrary to physical; registers, different virtual registers never share the same number. Whereas; physical registers are statically defined in a ``TargetRegisterInfo.td`` file; and cannot be created by the application developer, that is not the case with; virtual registers.

The SmallBitVector container provides the same interface as BitVector, but it is; optimized for the case where only a small number of bits, less than 25 or so,; are needed. It also transparently supports larger bit counts, but slightly less; efficiently than a plain BitVector, so SmallBitVector should only be used when; larger counts are rare. At this time, SmallBitVector does not support set operations (and, or, xor), and; its operator[] does not provide an assignable lvalue. .. _dss_sparsebitvector:. SparseBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe). The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector. In our; implementation, setting or testing bits in sorted order (either forwards or; reverse) is O(1) worst case. Testing and setting bits within 128 bits (depends; on size) of the current bit is also O(1). As a general statement,; testing/setting bits in a SparseBitVector is O(distance away from last set bit). .. _dss_coalescingbitvector:. CoalescingBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.
