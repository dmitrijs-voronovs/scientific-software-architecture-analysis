Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**. This has been written in a particularly general way, so that it can be applied to up to 2 chromogenic stains (brightfield) or any number of fluorescence stains that QuPath can handle.

The TMA data viewer has been largely redesigned, to better display (exported) data across large Tissue Microarray studies.; 3. A new 'File -> Revert' command makes it easy to return to the last saved version of analysis. It's not as good as a comprehensive 'undo' system... but it's something.; 4. A new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command helps with making various kinds of intensity measurements, across different resolutions and different kinds of objects.; 5. QuPath's spatial awareness has been improved, using Delaunay triangulation.; 6.

Deployability,"This release fixes a lot of bugs (especially related to Windows and Mac compatibility when importing text data), as well as adding many improvements - some small, some bigger. Some of the more noticeable changes:; 1. The TMA dearrayer gives more understandable results, and labelling TMA grids is easier.; 2. The TMA data viewer has been largely redesigned, to better display (exported) data across large Tissue Microarray studies.; 3. A new 'File -> Revert' command makes it easy to return to the last saved version of analysis. It's not as good as a comprehensive 'undo' system... but it's something.; 4. A new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command helps with making various kinds of intensity measurements, across different resolutions and different kinds of objects.; 5. QuPath's spatial awareness has been improved, using Delaunay triangulation.; 6. Region-based analysis is easier, thanks to improved tissue detection and a better conversion of classified tiles to annotations. **Also, note that a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/qupath-users) is now available for QuPath-related announcements, questions or discussions - or for faster conversations, try [Gitter](https://gitter.im/qupath-users/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)**. ## Changelog; - Added check for updates on QuPath startup; - Made pre-release notice less obtrusive; - Added 'Measure -> Show measurement manager' command to enable measurements to be viewed & (optionally) removed; - Added 'File -> Revert' command to go back to the last saved version for the current image data; - Added new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command. This will eventually replace the Haralick features command (and possibly others), since it offers the same functionality in a much more flexible way.

Most noticeably, it is now possible to export annotation and detection measurements more easily from within scripts. Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**.

The TMA data viewer has been largely redesigned, to better display (exported) data across large Tissue Microarray studies.; 3.

This release contains many small-but-important fixes and updates requested over the past month. Most noticeably, it is now possible to export annotation and detection measurements more easily from within scripts. Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**. This has been written in a particularly general way, so that it can be applied to up to 2 chromogenic stains (brightfield) or any number of fluorescence stains that QuPath can handle. Further testing is required and the command still subject to change... therefore feedback would be welcome if you find it useful. <img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4690904/21578954/3104ec02-cf8d-11e6-9938-c2d0b29bb5b0.jpg"" width=320px />.

This release contains many small-but-important fixes and updates requested over the past month. Most noticeably, it is now possible to export annotation and detection measurements more easily from within scripts. Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**. This has been written in a particularly general way, so that it can be applied to up to 2 chromogenic stains (brightfield) or any number of fluorescence stains that QuPath can handle. Further testing is required and the command still subject to change... therefore feedback would be welcome if you find it useful. <img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4690904/21578954/3104ec02-cf8d-11e6-9938-c2d0b29bb5b0.jpg"" width=320px />.

This release contains many small-but-important fixes and updates requested over the past month. Most noticeably, it is now possible to export annotation and detection measurements more easily from within scripts. Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**. This has been written in a particularly general way, so that it can be applied to up to 2 chromogenic stains (brightfield) or any number of fluorescence stains that QuPath can handle.

Usability,"This release fixes a lot of bugs (especially related to Windows and Mac compatibility when importing text data), as well as adding many improvements - some small, some bigger. Some of the more noticeable changes:; 1. The TMA dearrayer gives more understandable results, and labelling TMA grids is easier.; 2. The TMA data viewer has been largely redesigned, to better display (exported) data across large Tissue Microarray studies.; 3. A new 'File -> Revert' command makes it easy to return to the last saved version of analysis. It's not as good as a comprehensive 'undo' system... but it's something.; 4. A new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command helps with making various kinds of intensity measurements, across different resolutions and different kinds of objects.; 5. QuPath's spatial awareness has been improved, using Delaunay triangulation.; 6. Region-based analysis is easier, thanks to improved tissue detection and a better conversion of classified tiles to annotations. **Also, note that a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/qupath-users) is now available for QuPath-related announcements, questions or discussions - or for faster conversations, try [Gitter](https://gitter.im/qupath-users/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)**. ## Changelog; - Added check for updates on QuPath startup; - Made pre-release notice less obtrusive; - Added 'Measure -> Show measurement manager' command to enable measurements to be viewed & (optionally) removed; - Added 'File -> Revert' command to go back to the last saved version for the current image data; - Added new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command. This will eventually replace the Haralick features command (and possibly others), since it offers the same functionality in a much more flexible way.
