Modifiability," regular; expression interpreter into native code with LLVM?. Have fun - try doing something crazy and unusual. Building a language; like everyone else always has, is much less fun than trying something a; little crazy or off the wall and seeing how it turns out. If you get; stuck or want to talk about it, please post on the `LLVM forums ; <https://discourse.llvm.org>`_: it has lots of people who are interested; in languages and are often willing to help out. Before we end this tutorial, I want to talk about some ""tips and tricks""; for generating LLVM IR. These are some of the more subtle things that; may not be obvious, but are very useful if you want to take advantage of; LLVM's capabilities. Properties of the LLVM IR; =========================. We have a couple of common questions about code in the LLVM IR form -; let's just get these out of the way right now, shall we?. Target Independence; -------------------. Kaleidoscope is an example of a ""portable language"": any program written; in Kaleidoscope will work the same way on any target that it runs on.; Many other languages have this property, e.g. lisp, java, haskell,; javascript, python, etc (note that while these languages are portable,; not all their libraries are). One nice aspect of LLVM is that it is often capable of preserving target; independence in the IR: you can take the LLVM IR for a; Kaleidoscope-compiled program and run it on any target that LLVM; supports, even emitting C code and compiling that on targets that LLVM; doesn't support natively. You can trivially tell that the Kaleidoscope; compiler generates target-independent code because it never queries for; any target-specific information when generating code. The fact that LLVM provides a compact, target-independent,; representation for code gets a lot of people excited. Unfortunately,; these people are usually thinking about C or a language from the C; family when they are asking questions about language portability. I say; ""unfortunately"", b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst:5647,portab,portable,5647,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,1,['portab'],['portable']

This section presents the visualization technique available in ROOT; to represent multiple variables (>4) data sets. #### Spider (Radar) Plots. Spider plots (sometimes called “web-plots” or “radar plots”) are used; to compare series of data points (events). They use the human ability; to spot un-symmetry. ![Example of spider plot.](pictures/spider1.png). Variables are represented on individual axes displayed along a circle.; For each variable the minimum value sits on the circle’s center, and; the maximum on the circle’s radius. Spider plots are not suitable for; an accurate graph reading since, by their nature, it can be difficult; to read out very detailed values, but they give quickly a global view; of an event in order to compare it with the others. In ROOT the spider; plot facility is accessed from the tree viewer GUI. The variables to; be visualized are selected in the tree viewer and can be scanned using; the spider plot button. ![The tree viewer Graphical User Interface and the Spider Plot Editor.](pictures/spider2.png). The spider plot graphics editor provides two tabs to interact with; the spider plots’ output: the tab “Style” defining the spider layout; and the tab “Browse” to navigate in the tree. #### Parallel Coordinates Plots; \index{parallel coordinates}. The Parallel Coordinates Plots are a common way of studying and; visualizing multiple variables data sets. They were proposed by in; A.Inselberg in 1981 as a new way to represent multi-dimensional; information. In traditional Cartesian coordinates, axes are mutually; perpendicular. In Parallel coordinates, all axes are parallel which; allows representing data in much more than three dimensions. To show; a set of points in Parallel Coordinates, a set of parallel lines is; drawn, typically vertical and equally spaced.

This class contains the parts of `RVec` that can be optimized for trivially copiable types.; In particular, destruction can be skipped and memcpy can be used in place of copy/move construction.; These optimizations are inherited from LLVM's SmallVector. `RVecImpl<T>`; The analogous of LLVM's `SmallVectorImpl`, it factors out of `RVec` the parts that are independent of; the small buffer size, to limit the amount of code generated and provide a way to slice the small buffer; size when passing around `RVec` objects. `RVecN<T, N>`; It aggregates `RVecImpl` and `SmallVectorStorage` (see below) through public inheritance.; `N` is the small buffer size. `RVec<T>`; Inherits from `RVecN` and fixes the small buffer size `N` to a reasonable default.; We expect most users to use this type and only very rarely switch to `RVecN` to tweak the small buffer size. ### Helper types. - `SmallVectorAlignmentAndSize`: used to figure out the offset of the first small-buffer element in; `SmallVectorTemplateCommon::getFirstEl`; - `SmallVectorStorage`: properly aligned ""small buffer"" storage. It's a separate type so that it can be specialized to; be properly aligned also for the case of small buffer size = 0; - `RVecInlineStorageSize`: calculates the size of the small buffer in `RVec`. ## Memory adoption. We need RVec to be able to act as a view over an existing buffer rather than use its own; to save copies and allocations when reading ROOT data into `RVec`s, e.g. in `RDataFrame`.

Modifiability," scenarios are possible:. 1 - where `analyticalIntegral()` will be able to support AD. 2 - where `analyticalIntegral()` will *not* be able to support AD. This requires further research. ### What if my evaluate() function cannot support AD?. In some cases. the `evaluate()` function is written in a piece-wise format; (multiple evaluations based on multiple chunks of code). You can review the; `MathFuncs.h` file to find AD support for several piece-wise (`if code==1; {...} else if code==2 {...}` ) code snippets. However, there may still be some cases where AD support may not be possible; due to the way that `evaluate()` function works in that instance. ### What if my evaluate() function depends heavily on caching?. For simple caching, the caching logic can be separated from the; mathematical code that is being moved to `MathFuncs.h`, so that it can; retained in the original file. For more complicated scenarios, the `code` variable can be used to identify; use cases (parts of the mathematical code in `evaluate()`) that should be; supported, while other parts that are explicitly not be supported (e.g., using; `if code==1 {...} else if code==2 {...}`). ### Can classes using Numerical Integration support AD?. So far, no. This needs further exploration. Hint: classes using Numerical; Integration can be identified with the absence of the `analyticalIntegral()`; function. ### Why is my code falling back to Numeric Differentiation?. If you call in to an external Math library, and you use a function that has a; customized variant with an already defined custom derivative, then you may see; a warning like ""falling back to Numeric Differentiation"". In most such cases,; your derivative should still work, since Numeric Differentiation is already; well-tested in Clad. To handle this, either define a custom derivative for that external function,; or find a way to expose it to Clad.

Modifiability," semi-interesting (but probably still useless) toy. :). It is interesting to see how far we've come, and how little code it has; taken. We built the entire lexer, parser, AST, code generator, an; interactive run-loop (with a JIT!), and emitted debug information in; standalone executables - all in under 1000 lines of (non-comment/non-blank); code. Our little language supports a couple of interesting features: it; supports user defined binary and unary operators, it uses JIT; compilation for immediate evaluation, and it supports a few control flow; constructs with SSA construction. Part of the idea of this tutorial was to show you how easy and fun it; can be to define, build, and play with languages. Building a compiler; need not be a scary or mystical process! Now that you've seen some of; the basics, I strongly encourage you to take the code and hack on it.; For example, try adding:. - **global variables** - While global variables have questionable value; in modern software engineering, they are often useful when putting; together quick little hacks like the Kaleidoscope compiler itself.; Fortunately, our current setup makes it very easy to add global; variables: just have value lookup check to see if an unresolved; variable is in the global variable symbol table before rejecting it.; To create a new global variable, make an instance of the LLVM; ``GlobalVariable`` class.; - **typed variables** - Kaleidoscope currently only supports variables; of type double. This gives the language a very nice elegance, because; only supporting one type means that you never have to specify types.; Different languages have different ways of handling this. The easiest; way is to require the user to specify types for every variable; definition, and record the type of the variable in the symbol table; along with its Value\*.; - **arrays, structs, vectors, etc** - Once you add types, you can start; extending the type system in all sorts of interesting ways.

Selection Requirements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The refactoring rule requirements that require some form of source selection; are listed below:. - ``SourceRangeSelectionRequirement`` evaluates to a source range when the; action is invoked with some sort of selection. This requirement should be; satisfied when a refactoring is initiated in an editor, even when the user; has not selected anything (the range will contain the cursor's location in; that case). .. FIXME: Future selection requirements. .. FIXME: Maybe mention custom selection requirements?. Other Requirements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are several other requirements types that can be used when creating; a refactoring rule:. - The ``RefactoringOptionsRequirement`` requirement is an abstract class that; should be subclassed by requirements working with options. The more; concrete ``OptionRequirement`` requirement is a simple implementation of the; aforementioned class that returns the value of the specified option when; it's evaluated. The next section talks more about refactoring options and; how they can be used when creating a rule. Refactoring Options; -------------------. Refactoring options are values that affect a refactoring operation and are; specified either using command-line options or another client-specific; mechanism. Options should be created using a class that derives either from; the ``OptionalRequiredOption`` or ``RequiredRefactoringOption``. The following; example shows how one can created a required string option that corresponds to; the ``-new-name`` command-line option in clang-refactor:. .. code-block:: c++. class NewNameOption : publi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RefactoringEngine.rst:9326,refactor,refactoring,9326,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RefactoringEngine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RefactoringEngine.rst,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

This option is; only recommended if the program source cannot be changed or if the; program also relies on additional C89-specific behavior that cannot; be changed. All of this only applies to C code; the meaning of inline; in C++ is very different from its meaning in either GNU89 or C99. ""missing"" vector __builtin functions. The Intel and AMD manuals document a number ""<*mmintrin.h>""; header files, which define a standardized API for accessing vector operations; on X86 CPUs. These functions have names like _mm_xor_ps and; _mm256_addsub_pd. Compilers have leeway to implement these functions; however they want. Since Clang supports an excellent set of native vector operations,; the Clang headers implement these interfaces in terms of the native vector; operations. In contrast, GCC implements these functions mostly as a 1-to-1 mapping to; builtin function calls, like __builtin_ia32_paddw128. These builtin; functions are an internal implementation detail of GCC, and are not portable to; the Intel compiler, the Microsoft compiler, or Clang. If you get build errors; mentioning these, the fix is simple: switch to the *mmintrin.h functions.; The same issue occurs for NEON and Altivec for the ARM and PowerPC; architectures respectively. For these, make sure to use the <arm_neon.h>; and <altivec.h> headers.; For x86 architectures this script should help with; the manual migration process. It will rewrite your source files in place to; use the APIs instead of builtin function calls. Just call it like this:. builtins.py *.c *.h. and it will rewrite all of the .c and .h files in the current directory to; use the API calls instead of calls like __builtin_ia32_paddw128. Lvalue casts. Old versions of GCC permit casting the left-hand side of an assignment to a; different type.

Modifiability," severity is used for; diagnostics indicating the program is never acceptable under any circumstances.; When an error is emitted, the AST for the input code may not be fully built.; The ``EXTENSION`` and ``EXTWARN`` severities are used for extensions to the; language that Clang accepts. This means that Clang fully understands and can; represent them in the AST, but we produce diagnostics to tell the user their; code is non-portable. The difference is that the former are ignored by; default, and the later warn by default. The ``WARNING`` severity is used for; constructs that are valid in the currently selected source language but that; are dubious in some way. The ``REMARK`` severity provides generic information; about the compilation that is not necessarily related to any dubious code. The; ``NOTE`` level is used to staple more information onto previous diagnostics. These *severities* are mapped into a smaller set (the ``Diagnostic::Level``; enum, {``Ignored``, ``Note``, ``Remark``, ``Warning``, ``Error``, ``Fatal``}) of; output; *levels* by the diagnostics subsystem based on various configuration options.; Clang internally supports a fully fine grained mapping mechanism that allows; you to map almost any diagnostic to the output level that you want. The only; diagnostics that cannot be mapped are ``NOTE``\ s, which always follow the; severity of the previously emitted diagnostic and ``ERROR``\ s, which can only; be mapped to ``Fatal`` (it is not possible to turn an error into a warning, for; example). Diagnostic mappings are used in many ways. For example, if the user specifies; ``-pedantic``, ``EXTENSION`` maps to ``Warning``, if they specify; ``-pedantic-errors``, it turns into ``Error``. This is used to implement; options like ``-Wunused_macros``, ``-Wundef`` etc. Mapping to ``Fatal`` should only be used for diagnostics that are considered so; severe that error recovery won't be able to recover sensibly from them (thus; spewing a ton of bogus errors).

Modifiability," simultaneous PDFs being considered) and binned likelihoods (adding further; complexity). In this example, the `RooNLLVarNew::translate()` function generates code to; compute the Negative Log likelihood (NLL). We can see that the intermediate; result variable `resName` is added to the context so that it can be accessed; and used in the generated code. This variable is made available globally; (using `addToGlobalScope()`). If a weight sum is needed, then it creates a loop, and `weightSumName` is; accumulated with the weight variable. Otherwise, if there are multiple; simultaneous PDFs, then it adds a term to the result that scales with the; logarithm of the count of simultaneous PDFs. The rest of the function body; (including the loop scope with NLL computation) has omitted from this example; to keep it brief. Helper functions:. - `makeValidVarName()` helps get a valid name from the name of the respective; RooFit class. It then helps save it to the variable that represents the result; of this class (the squashed code/ C++ function that will be created). - `addToGlobalScope()` helps declare and initialize the results variable, so; that it can be available globally (throughout the function body). For local; variables, the `addToCodeBody()` function can be used to keep the variables in; the respective scope (for example, within a loop). - `beginLoop()` helps build the start and the end of a For loop for your; class. Simply place this function in the scope and place the contents of the; `For` loop below this statement. The code squashing task will automatically; build a loop around the statements that follow it. There's no need to worry; about the index of these loops, because they get propagated. For example, if; you want to iterate over a vector of RooFit objects using a loop, you don't; have to think about indexing them properly because the `beginLoop()` function; takes care of that.

Modifiability," slightly more complicated example of the simple; bootstrapping scenario. Apple Clang is built using a 2-stage build. The stage1 compiler is a host-only compiler with some options set. The stage1; compiler is a balance of optimization vs build time because it is a throwaway.; The stage2 compiler is the fully optimized compiler intended to ship to users. Setting up these compilers requires a lot of options. To simplify the; configuration the Apple Clang build settings are contained in CMake Cache files.; You can build an Apple Clang compiler using the following commands:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/Apple-stage1.cmake <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage2-distribution. This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option.

This rule avoids having to define how to execute a matched location list; entry operation expression on the same stack as the call when there are; multiple matches. But it allows the call to obtain the location; description for a variable or formal parameter which may use a location; list expression. An alternative is to treat the case when D has a ``DW_AT_location``; attribute that is encoded as a ``loclist`` or ``loclistsptr``, and the; specified location list expression E' matches a single location list; entry with operation expression E, the same as the ``exprloc`` case and; evaluate on the same stack.

Modifiability," std::vector is exception-safe, and some implementations have pessimizations; that copy elements when SmallVector would move them. #. SmallVector understands ``std::is_trivially_copyable<Type>`` and uses realloc aggressively. #. Many LLVM APIs take a SmallVectorImpl as an out parameter (see the note; below). #. SmallVector with N equal to 0 is smaller than std::vector on 64-bit; platforms, since it uses ``unsigned`` (instead of ``void*``) for its size; and capacity. .. note::. Prefer to use ``ArrayRef<T>`` or ``SmallVectorImpl<T>`` as a parameter type. It's rarely appropriate to use ``SmallVector<T, N>`` as a parameter type.; If an API only reads from the vector, it should use :ref:`ArrayRef; <dss_arrayref>`. Even if an API updates the vector the ""small size"" is; unlikely to be relevant; such an API should use the ``SmallVectorImpl<T>``; class, which is the ""vector header"" (and methods) without the elements; allocated after it. Note that ``SmallVector<T, N>`` inherits from; ``SmallVectorImpl<T>`` so the conversion is implicit and costs nothing.

Modifiability," step is to identify refactoring candidates through; static analysis. For example, in the following code snippet the pointer `c` is an output; parameter:. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; }. void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c->name = ...;; } else {; c->name = ...;; }; }; ```. We would like to refactor this code into:. ```c++; Customer GetCustomer() {; Customer c;; c.account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c.name = ...;; } else {; c.name = ...;; }; return c;; }; ```. However, in the function below the parameter `c` is not an output parameter; because its field `name` is not overwritten on every path through the function. ```c++; void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c->name = ...;; }; }; ```. The code also cannot read the value of the parameter before overwriting it:. ```c++; void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; use(c->account_id);; c->name = ...;; c->account_id = ...;; }; ```. Functions that escape the pointer also block the refactoring:. ```c++; Customer* kGlobalCustomer;. void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->name = ...;; c->account_id = ...;; kGlobalCustomer = c;; }; ```. To identify a candidate function for refactoring, we need to do the following:. * Find a function with a non-const pointer or reference parameter. * Find the definition of that function. * Prove that the function completely overwrites the pointee on all paths; before returning. * Prove that the function reads the pointee only after overwriting it. * Prove that the function does not persist the pointer in a data structure; that is live after the function returns. There are also requirements that all usage sites of the candidate function must; satisfy, for example, that function arguments do not alias, that users are not; taking the address of the function, and so on.

They can be named (``%X``) or; unnamed (``%52``). :Syntax:. ::. %X = type opaque; %52 = type opaque. :Examples:. +--------------+-------------------+; | ``opaque`` | An opaque type. |; +--------------+-------------------+. .. _constants:. Constants; =========. LLVM has several different basic types of constants. This section; describes them all and their syntax. Simple Constants; ----------------. **Boolean constants**; The two strings '``true``' and '``false``' are both valid constants; of the ``i1`` type.; **Integer constants**; Standard integers (such as '4') are constants of the :ref:`integer; <t_integer>` type. They can be either decimal or; hexadecimal. Decimal integers can be prefixed with - to represent; negative integers, e.g. '``-1234``'. Hexadecimal integers must be; prefixed with either u or s to indicate whether they are unsigned; or signed respectively. e.g '``u0x8000``' gives 32768, whilst; '``s0x8000``' gives -32768. Note that hexadecimal integers are sign extended from the number; of active bits, i.e. the bit width minus the number of leading; zeros. So '``s0x0001``' of type '``i16``' will be -1, not 1.; **Floating-point constants**; Floating-point constants use standard decimal notation (e.g.; 123.421), exponential notation (e.g. 1.23421e+2), or a more precise; hexadecimal notation (see below). The assembler requires the exact; decimal value of a floating-point constant. For example, the; assembler accepts 1.25 but rejects 1.3 because 1.3 is a repeating; decimal in binary. Floating-point constants must have a; :ref:`floating-point <t_floating>` type.; **Null pointer constants**; The identifier '``null``' is recognized as a null pointer constant; and must be of :ref:`pointer type <t_pointer>`.; **Token constants**; The identifier '``none``' is recognized as an empty token constant; and must be of :ref:`token type <t_token>`. The one non-intuitive notation for constants is the hexadecimal form of; floating-point constants.

The total number of rows; read from the file is returned. ## Trees in Analysis. The methods `TTree::Draw`, `TTree::MakeClass` and; `TTree::MakeSelector` are available for data analysis using trees. The; **`TTree::Draw`** method is a powerful yet simple way to look and draw the; trees contents. It enables you to plot a variable (a leaf) with just one; line of code. However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look; at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your; analysis. For these cases, you can use `TTree::MakeClass`. It creates a; class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand; it to do the logic of your analysis. The `TTree::MakeSelector` is the recommended method for ROOT data; analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel; processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several; processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor.; With `MakeClass` the user has control over the event loop, with; `MakeSelector `the tree is in control of the event loop. ## Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw. We will use the tree in `cernstaff.root` that was made by the macro in; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/staff.C`. First, open the file and lists its contents. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f (""cernstaff.root""); root[] f.ls(); TFile** cernstaff.root; TFile* cernstaff.root; KEY: TTree T;1 staff data from ascii file; ```. We can see the **`TTree `**""`T`"" in the file. We will use it to; experiment with the **`TTree::Draw`** method, so let's create a pointer to it:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TTree *MyTree = T; ```. Cling allows us to get simply the object by using it. Here we define a; pointer to a **`TTree`** object and assign it the value of ""`T`"", the; **`TTree`** in the file.

Modifiability," the PowerPC target). Note that these two naming schemes are hardcoded into ``llvm-config``. Using; any other naming scheme will confuse ``llvm-config`` and produce a lot of; (seemingly unrelated) linker errors when linking ``llc``. To make your target actually do something, you need to implement a subclass of; ``TargetMachine``. This implementation should typically be in the file; ``lib/Target/DummyTargetMachine.cpp``, but any file in the ``lib/Target``; directory will be built and should work. To use LLVM's target independent code; generator, you should do what all current machine backends do: create a; subclass of ``LLVMTargetMachine``. (To create a target from scratch, create a; subclass of ``TargetMachine``.). To get LLVM to actually build and link your target, you need to run ``cmake``; with ``-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=Dummy``. This will build your; target without needing to add it to the list of all the targets. Once your target is stable, you can add it to the ``LLVM_ALL_TARGETS`` variable; located in the main ``CMakeLists.txt``. Target Machine; ==============. ``LLVMTargetMachine`` is designed as a base class for targets implemented with; the LLVM target-independent code generator. The ``LLVMTargetMachine`` class; should be specialized by a concrete target class that implements the various; virtual methods. ``LLVMTargetMachine`` is defined as a subclass of; ``TargetMachine`` in ``include/llvm/Target/TargetMachine.h``. The; ``TargetMachine`` class implementation (``TargetMachine.cpp``) also processes; numerous command-line options. To create a concrete target-specific subclass of ``LLVMTargetMachine``, start; by copying an existing ``TargetMachine`` class and header. You should name the; files that you create to reflect your specific target. For instance, for the; SPARC target, name the files ``SparcTargetMachine.h`` and; ``SparcTargetMachine.cpp``.

The histogram classes inherit from the attribute classes:; **`TAttLine`**, **`TAttFill`**, **`TAttMarker`** and **`TAttText`**.; See the description of these classes for the list of options. ### Setting Tick Marks on the Axis. The **`TPad`**`::SetTicks()` method specifies the type of tick; marks on the axis. Let `tx=gPad->GetTickx()` and; `ty=gPad->GetTicky()`. - `tx` = 1; tick marks on top side are drawn (inside); - `tx` = 2; tick marks and labels on top side are drawn; - `ty` = 1; tick marks on right side are drawn (inside); - `ty` = 2; tick marks and labels on right side are drawn; - `tx=ty=0` by default only the left Y axis and X bottom axis are; drawn. Use **`TPad`**`::SetTicks(tx,ty)` to set these options. See also; the methods of **`TAxis`** that set specific axis attributes. If; multiple color-filled histograms are drawn on the same pad, the fill; area may hide the axis tick marks.

Note: Calling FlushBaskets too often (either directly of via AutoSave(""FlushBaskets"")) can lead to unnecessary fragmentation of the ROOT file,; since it write the baskets to disk (and a new basket will be started at the next fill) whether or not the content was close to filling the basket or not.

Modifiability," the X-axis; and Y-axis are relevant. See the class **` TAxis`** for a description; of all the access methods. The bin edges are always stored internally; in double precision. You can examine the actual edges / limits of the histogram bins by; accessing the axis parameters, like in the example below:. ``` {.cpp}; const Int_t XBINS = 5; const Int_t YBINS = 5;; Double_t xEdges[XBINS + 1] = {0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0};; Double_t yEdges[YBINS + 1] = {-1.0, -0.4, -0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0};. TH2* h = new TH2D(""h2"", ""h2"", XBINS, xEdges, YBINS, yEdges);; TAxis* xAxis = h->GetXaxis(); TAxis* yAxis = h->GetYaxis();. cout << ""Third bin on Y-dimension: "" << endl; // corresponds to; // [-0.2, 0.5]; cout << ""\tLower edge: "" << yAxis->GetBinLowEdge(3) << endl;; cout << ""\tCenter: "" << yAxis->GetBinCenter(3) << endl;; cout << ""\tUpper edge: "" << yAxis->GetBinUpEdge(3) << endl;; ```. ## Bin Numbering. All histogram types support fixed or variable bin sizes. 2-D; histograms may have fixed size bins along X and variable size bins; along Y or vice-versa. The functions to fill, manipulate, draw, or; access histograms are identical in both cases. ### Convention. For all histogram types: `nbins` , `xlow` , `xup`. Bin\# 0 contains the underflow. Bin\# 1 contains the first bin with low-edge ( `xlow` INCLUDED). The second to last bin (bin\# `nbins`) contains the upper-edge; (`xup` EXCLUDED). The Last bin (bin\# `nbins+1)` contains the overflow. In case of 2-D or 3-D histograms, a ""global bin"" number is defined.; For example, assuming a 3-D histogram `h` with `binx`, `biny`, `binz`,; the function returns a global/linear bin number. ``` {.cpp}; Int_t bin = h->GetBin(binx, biny, binz);; ```. This global bin is useful to access the bin information independently; of the dimension. ### Re-binning; \index{histogram!rebin}.

One significant consequence is that now when an object is stored in a split branch; the rule is associtated with the branch of the last of the rule's sources rather; than the last of the object's data member. - Properly support TStreamerInfo written by ROOT v4.00. - Fix the ordering of the keys in a TFile being written; in particular fixing the result of GetKey and FindKey which were no longer returning the lastest cycle for a TFile being written since v5.34/11. ## Networking Libraries. ### HTTP Server. ##### Command Interface; One can now register an arbitrary command to the server, which become visible in the web browser. Then, when the item is clicked by the user, the command ends-up in a gROOT->ProcessLineSync() call. ##### Custom Properties ; Custom properties can be configured for any item in the server. For example, one could configure an icon for each item visible in the browser. Or one could 'hide' any item from the user (but keep access with normal http requests). With such properties one could specify which item is drawn when web page is loaded, or configure monitoring. See tutorials/http/httpcontrol.C macro for more details. ##### Method Calls; Implement exe.json requests to be able to execute any method of registered objects. This request is used to provide remote TTree::Draw() functionality. ##### Misc; Correctly set 'Cache-Control' headers when replying to http requests.; Better support of STL containers when converting objects into json with TBufferJSON class. ## JavaScript ROOT. - Several files can now be loaded simultaneously; - Use d3.time.scale to display time scales; - Implemented drag and drop to superimpose histograms or graphs; - Allow selection of drawing option via context menu; - Better support of touch devices; - Provi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md:9640,config,configured,9640,README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,1,['config'],['configured']

TS is the smaller of the generic type bit size and S scaled by 8 (the byte; size). If TS is smaller than the generic type bit size then T is an unsigned; integral type of bit size TS, otherwise T is the generic type.

Modifiability," the destination context. If it happens to be equivalent then; we skip the copy. The informal definition of structural equivalency is the following:; Two nodes are **structurally equivalent** if they are. - builtin types and refer to the same type, e.g. ``int`` and ``int`` are; structurally equivalent,; - function types and all their parameters have structurally equivalent types,; - record types and all their fields in order of their definition have the same; identifier names and structurally equivalent types,; - variable or function declarations and they have the same identifier name and; their types are structurally equivalent. In C, two types are structurally equivalent if they are *compatible types*. For; a formal definition of *compatible types*, please refer to 6.2.7/1 in the C11; standard. However, there is no definition for *compatible types* in the C++; standard. Still, we extend the definition of structural equivalency to; templates and their instantiations similarly: besides checking the previously; mentioned properties, we have to check for equivalent template; parameters/arguments, etc. The structural equivalent check can be and is used independently from the; ASTImporter, e.g. the ``clang::Sema`` class uses it also. The equivalence of nodes may depend on the equivalency of other pairs of nodes.; Thus, the check is implemented as a parallel graph traversal. We traverse; through the nodes of both graphs at the same time. The actual implementation is; similar to breadth-first-search. Let's say we start the traverse with the <A,B>; pair of nodes. Whenever the traversal reaches a pair <X,Y> then the following; statements are true:. - A and X are nodes from the same ASTContext.; - B and Y are nodes from the same ASTContext.; - A and B may or may not be from the same ASTContext.; - if A == X and B == Y (pointer equivalency) then (there is a cycle during the; traverse). - A and B are structurally equivalent if and only if. - All dependent nodes on the path fro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:92572,extend,extend,92572,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['extend'],['extend']
Modifiability," the effects of parameter limits may be found in; the last chapter. ## M strategy ##. At many places in the analysis of the $\mbox{FCN}$ (the user; provided function), M must decide whether to be ""safe"" and waste a few; function calls in order to know where it is, or to be ""fast"" and attempt; to get the requested results with the fewest possible calls at a certain; risk of not obtaining the precision desired by the user. In order to; allow the user to influence these decisions, there is a M class; MnStrategy (see [api:strategy]) which the user can use to put different; settings. In the current release, this MnStrategy can be instantiated; with three different minimization quality levels for low (0), medium (1); and high (2) quality. Default settings for iteration cycles and; tolerances are initialized then. The default setting is set for medium; quality. Value 0 (low) indicates to M that it should economize function; calls; it is intended for cases where there are many variable parameters; and/or the function takes a long time to calculate and/or the user is; not interested in very precise values for parameter errors. On the other; hand, value 2 (high) indicates that M is allowed to waste function calls; in order to be sure that all values are precise; it is intended for; cases where the function is evaluated in a relatively short time and/or; where the parameter errors must be calculated reliably. In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$.

Current Status; ==============. Clang/LLVM; ----------; .. _compiler:. The 3.9 release of clang includes ThinLTO support. However, ThinLTO; is under active development, and new features, improvements and bugfixes; are being added for the next release. For the latest ThinLTO support,; `build a recent version of clang and LLVM; <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>`_. Linkers; -------; .. _linkers:; .. _linker:. ThinLTO is currently supported for the following linkers:. - **gold (via the gold-plugin)**:; Similar to monolithic LTO, this requires using; a `gold linker configured with plugins enabled; <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_.; - **ld64**:; Starting with `Xcode 8 <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_.; - **lld**:; Starting with r284050 for ELF, r298942 for COFF. Usage; =====. Basic; -----. To utilize ThinLTO, simply add the -flto=thin option to compile and link. E.g. .. code-block:: console. % clang -flto=thin -O2 file1.c file2.c -c; % clang -flto=thin -O2 file1.o file2.o -o a.out. When using lld-link, the -flto option need only be added to the compile step:. .. code-block:: console. % clang-cl -flto=thin -O2 -c file1.c file2.c; % lld-link /out:a.exe file1.obj file2.obj. As mentioned earlier, by default the linkers will launch the ThinLTO backend; threads in parallel, passing the resulting native object files back to the; linker for the final native link. As such, the usage model is the same as; non-LTO. With gold, if you see an error during the link of the form:. .. code-block:: console. /usr/bin/ld: error",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThinLTO.rst:2143,plugin,plugin,2143,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThinLTO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThinLTO.rst,3,"['config', 'plugin']","['configured', 'plugin', 'plugins']"
Modifiability," the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``. For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2.

This information is used by the device compilation stage to determine which; symbols need to be exported from the device. We use the ``omp_offload.info``; metadata node to pass this information device compilation stage. Accessing Entries on the Device; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Accessing the entries in the device is done using the address field in the; :ref:`offload entry<table-tgt_offload_entry_structure>`. The runtime will set; the address to the pointer associated with the device image during runtime; initialization. This is used to call the corresponding kernel function when; entering a ``#pragma omp target`` region. For variables, the runtime maintains a; table mapping host pointers to device pointers. Global variables inside a; ``#pragma omp target declare`` directive are first initialized to the host's; address. Once the device address is initialized we insert it into the table to; map the host address to the device address. Debugging Information; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. We generate structures to hold debugging information that is passed to; ``libomptarget``. This allows the front-end to generate information the runtime; library uses for more informative error messages.

However, in the case of; ``bar.cpp`` we use the constructor with number ``(2)``, which does not; explicitly initialize the ``a`` member, so the default ``InitListExpr`` is; needed and thus instantiated. When we merge the AST of ``foo.cpp`` and; ``bar.cpp`` we must create an AST node for the class template instantiation of; ``X<char>`` which has all the required nodes. Therefore, when we find an; existing ``ClassTemplateSpecializationDecl`` then we merge the fields of the; ``ClassTemplateSpecializationDecl`` in the ""from"" context in a way that the; ``InitListExpr`` is copied if not existent yet.

For example, when calling ``x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-clang-g++``,; the driver will first attempt to use the configuration file named::. x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-clang++.cfg. If this file is not found, it will attempt to use the name found; in the executable instead::. x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-clang-g++.cfg. Note that options such as ``--driver-mode=``, ``--target=``, ``-m32`` affect; the search algorithm. For example, the aforementioned executable called with; ``-m32`` argument will instead search for::. i386-pc-linux-gnu-clang++.cfg. If none of the aforementioned files are found, the driver will instead search; for separate driver and target configuration files and attempt to load both.; The former is named ``<driver>.cfg`` while the latter is named; ``<triple>.cfg``. Similarly to the previous variants, the canonical driver name; will be preferred, and the compiler will fall back to the actual name. For example, ``x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-clang-g++`` will attempt to load two; configuration files named respectively::. clang++.cfg; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.cfg. with fallback to trying::. clang-g++.cfg; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.cfg.

Modifiability," the phi nodes when lowering; assignments to mutable variables?"". The issue here is that LLVM; *requires* that its IR be in SSA form: there is no ""non-ssa"" mode for; it. However, SSA construction requires non-trivial algorithms and data; structures, so it is inconvenient and wasteful for every front-end to; have to reproduce this logic. Memory in LLVM; ==============. The 'trick' here is that while LLVM does require all register values to; be in SSA form, it does not require (or permit) memory objects to be in; SSA form. In the example above, note that the loads from G and H are; direct accesses to G and H: they are not renamed or versioned. This; differs from some other compiler systems, which do try to version memory; objects. In LLVM, instead of encoding dataflow analysis of memory into; the LLVM IR, it is handled with `Analysis; Passes <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ which are computed on demand. With this in mind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator. Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that space. Stack variables; work the same way, except that instead of being declared with global; variable definitions, they are declared with the `LLVM alloca; instruction <../../LangRef.html#alloca-instruction>`_:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @example() {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; ...; %tmp = load i32, i32* %X ; load the stack value %X from the stack.; %tmp2 = add i32 %tmp, 1 ; increment ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:4133,variab,variable,4133,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability," the program or; not. Blocks using automatic (stack) memory are objects and may be; messaged, although they may not be assigned into ``__weak`` locations; if garbage collection is enabled. Within a Block literal expression within a method definition; references to instance variables are also imported into the lexical; scope of the compound statement. These variables are implicitly; qualified as references from self, and so self is imported as a const; copy. The net effect is that instance variables can be mutated. The :block-term:`Block_copy` operator retains all objects held in; variables of automatic storage referenced within the Block expression; (or form strong references if running under garbage collection).; Object variables of ``__block`` storage type are assumed to hold; normal pointers with no provision for retain and release messages. Foundation defines (and supplies) ``-copy`` and ``-release`` methods for; Blocks. In the Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages, we allow the; ``__weak`` specifier for ``__block`` variables of object type. If; garbage collection is not enabled, this qualifier causes these; variables to be kept without retain messages being sent. This; knowingly leads to dangling pointers if the Block (or a copy) outlives; the lifetime of this object. In garbage collected environments, the ``__weak`` variable is set to; nil when the object it references is collected, as long as the; ``__block`` variable resides in the heap (either by default or via; ``Block_copy()``). The initial Apple implementation does in fact; start ``__block`` variables on the stack and migrate them to the heap; only as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation. It is a runtime error to attempt to assign a reference to a; stack-based Block into any storage marked ``__weak``, including; ``__weak`` ``__block`` variables. C++ Extensions; ==============. Block literal expressions within functions are extended to allow const; use of C++ objects, pointers, or references held in ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst:10171,variab,variables,10171,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability," the same name to a method (remember: method = member function; of a class) in the child class (**`TArrow`**) as in the parent; (**`TLine`**) does not give any problem. This is called **overriding**; a method. Draw in **`TArrow`** overrides Draw in **`TLine`**. There is; no possible ambiguity since, when one calls the `Draw()` method; this; applies to an object whose type is known. Suppose we have an object; `l` of type **`TLine`** and an object `a` of type **`TArrow`**. When; you want to draw the line, you do:. ``` {.cpp}; l.Draw();; ```. `Draw()` from **`TLine`** is called. If you do:. ``` {.cpp}; a.Draw();; ```. `Draw()` from **`TArrow`** is called and the arrow `a` is drawn. ### Data Encapsulation. We have seen previously the keyword ""`public`"". This keyword means; that every name declared public is seen by the outside world. This is; opposed to ""`private`"" that means only the class where the name was; declared private could see this name. For example, suppose we declare; in **`TArrow`** the variable `ArrowHeadSize` private. ``` {.cpp}; private:; int ArrowHeadSize;; ```. Then, only the methods (i.e. member functions) of **`TArrow`** will be; able to access this variable. Nobody else will see it. Even the; classes that we could derive from **`TArrow`** will not see it. On the; other hand, if we declare the method `Draw()` as public, everybody will; be able to see it and use it. You see that the character public or; private does not depend of the type of argument. It can be a data; member, a member function, or even a class. For example, in the case; of **`TArrow`**, the base class **`TLine`** is declared as public:. ``` {.cpp}; class TArrow : public TLine { ...; ```. This means that all methods of **`TArrow`** will be able to access all; methods of **`TLine`**, but this will be also true for anybody in the; outside world. Of course, this is true if **`TLine`** accepts the; outside world to see its methods/data members.

Modifiability," they are not needed. As an example, suppose that the user has defined the following; parameters:. - Parameter 0, constant. - Parameter 1, freely variable. - Parameter 2, variable with limits. - Parameter 3, constant. - Parameter 4, freely variable. Then the internal parameter list would be as follows:. - Internal parameter 0 = external parameter 1. - Internal parameter 1 = external parameter 2, transformed; appropriately. - Internal parameter 2 = external parameter 4. In the above example, M considers that the number of external parameters; is 5, and the number of internal parameters is 3. This is the number; which determines, for example, the size of the error matrix of the; parameters, since only variable parameters have errors. An important feature of M is that parameters are allowed to change types; during the M minimization and analysis of a $\mbox{FCN}$ function.; Several applications in M have methods available to make variable; parameters fixed and vice-versa; to impose, change, or remove limits; from variable parameters; and even to define completely new parameters; at any time during a run. In addition, some M applications (notably the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis) cause one or more variable parameters; to be temporarily fixed during the calculation. Therefore, the; correspondence between external and internal parameter lists is in; general a dynamic one, and the number of internal parameters is not; necessarily constant. For more details about parameter interaction see [api:parameters]. ### The transformation for parameters with limits ###. [intro:limits]. For variable parameters with double sided limits $a$ (lower) and $b$; (upper), M uses the following transformation:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \arcsin; \left( 2\: \frac{ P_{\mathrm{ext}}-a}{ b-a} - 1 \right) \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a + \frac{ b - a}{ 2}; \left( \sin P_{\mathrm{int}} + 1 \right) \end{aligned}$$. so that the internal value $P_{\mathrm{int}}$ can take on any value,; while",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:7504,variab,variable,7504,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,2,['variab'],['variable']

Variables for Building Libraries; --------------------------------. ``LIBRARYNAME``. This variable contains the base name of the library that will be built. For; example, to build a library named ``libsample.a``, ``LIBRARYNAME`` should; be set to ``sample``. ``BUILD_ARCHIVE``. By default, a library is a ``.o`` file that is linked directly into a; program. To build an archive (also known as a static library), set the; ``BUILD_ARCHIVE`` variable. ``SHARED_LIBRARY``. If ``SHARED_LIBRARY`` is defined in your Makefile, a shared (or dynamic); library will be built. Variables for Building Programs; -------------------------------. ``TOOLNAME``. This variable contains the name of the program that will be built. For; example, to build an executable named ``sample``, ``TOOLNAME`` should be set; to ``sample``. ``USEDLIBS``. This variable holds a space separated list of libraries that should be; linked into the program. These libraries must be libraries that come from; your **lib** directory. The libraries must be specified without their; ``lib`` prefix. For example, to link ``libsample.a``, you would set; ``USEDLIBS`` to ``sample.a``. Note that this works only for statically linked libraries. ``LLVMLIBS``. This variable holds a space separated list of libraries that should be; linked into the program. These libraries must be LLVM libraries. The; libraries must be specified without their ``lib`` prefix. For example, to; link with a driver that performs an IR transformation you might set; ``LLVMLIBS`` to this minimal set of libraries ``LLVMSupport.a LLVMCore.a; LLVMBitReader.a LLVMAsmParser.a LLVMAnalysis.a LLVMTransformUtils.a; LLVMScalarOpts.a LLVMTarget.a``.

The import() method now supports a new argument RenameAllVariablesExcept(const char* suffix, const char keepList) which; will rename all variables of the imported function by extended them with a supplied suffix,; except for a given list of variables, which are not renamed.; A new utility function importFromFile() has been added, which is similar to import, except that it take a string; specifier for the object to be imported rather than a reference. The string is expected to be of the form ; fileName:workspaceName:objectName and simplifies import of objects from other workspaces on file. The importFromFile; accepts all arguments accepted by the standard import() method.; Generic objects (inheriting from TObject) can now also be stored in the workspace under an alias name, rather; under their own name, which simplifies management of objects of types like TMatrixD that do not have a settable name. ws.import(matrix,""cov_matrix"") ;.

Modifiability," thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:. Multi-distribution configurations; ---------------------------------. The ``install-distribution`` target described above is for building a single; distribution. LLVM's build system also supports building multiple distributions,; which can be used to e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and; another for libraries (to enable development). These are configured by setting; the *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS* variable to hold a list of all distribution names; (which conventionally start with an uppercase letter, e.g. ""Development""), and; then setting the *LLVM_<distribution>_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* variable to the; list of targets for that distribution.

Modifiability," this document to implement compatible exception; handling. SEH filter expressions; -----------------------. The SEH personality functions also use funclets to implement filter expressions,; which allow executing arbitrary user code to decide which exceptions to catch.; Filter expressions should not be confused with the ``filter`` clause of the LLVM; ``landingpad`` instruction. Typically filter expressions are used to determine; if the exception came from a particular DLL or code region, or if code faulted; while accessing a particular memory address range. LLVM does not currently have; IR to represent filter expressions because it is difficult to represent their; control dependencies. Filter expressions run during the first phase of EH,; before cleanups run, making it very difficult to build a faithful control flow; graph. For now, the new EH instructions cannot represent SEH filter; expressions, and frontends must outline them ahead of time. Local variables of; the parent function can be escaped and accessed using the ``llvm.localescape``; and ``llvm.localrecover`` intrinsics. New exception handling instructions; ------------------------------------. The primary design goal of the new EH instructions is to support funclet; generation while preserving information about the CFG so that SSA formation; still works. As a secondary goal, they are designed to be generic across MSVC; and Itanium C++ exceptions. They make very few assumptions about the data; required by the personality, so long as it uses the familiar core EH actions:; catch, cleanup, and terminate. However, the new instructions are hard to modify; without knowing details of the EH personality. While they can be used to; represent Itanium EH, the landingpad model is strictly better for optimization; purposes. The following new instructions are considered ""exception handling pads"", in that; they must be the first non-phi instruction of a basic block that may be the; unwind destination of an EH flow edge:; `",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:24743,variab,variables,24743,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Support of POST HTTP requests. For example, ROOT objects can be send with POST request and used as arguments of; objects method execution in exe.bin and exe.json requests. Request and response HTTP headers are now directly accessible in THttpCallArg class. When command is registered with THttpServer::RegisterCommand() method,; one could configure additional arguments which should be submitted when; command is executed with cmd.json requests. Introduce restriction rules for objects access with THttpServer::Restrict() method.; Up to now general read-only flag was applied - either; everything read-only or everything is fully accessible.; Now one could restrict access to different parts of; objects hierarchy or even fully 'hide' them from the client.; Restriction based on user account name, which is applied; when htdigest authentication is configured.; One also able to allow execution of selected methods. Implement multi.bin and multi.json requests.; One could request many items with single HTTP request.; Let optimize communication between server and client. With *SNIFF* tag in ClassDef() comments one could expose different properties,; which than exposed by the TRootSniffer to the client with h.json requests.; Such possibility ease implementation of client-side code for custom classes. Allow to bind http port with loopback address.; This restrict access to http server only from localhost.; One could either specify 'loopback' option in constructor:; new THttpServer(""http:8080?loopback""); or in clear text specify IP address to which http socket should be bind:; new THttpServer(""http:127.0.0.1:8080""); If host has several network interfaces, one could select one for binding:; new THttpServer(""http:192.168.1.17:8080""). ### TNetXNGFileStager; Fixed ROOT-7703.

Modifiability," this, but an elegant and efficient way is; to use `Operator-Precedence; Parsing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser>`_.; This parsing technique uses the precedence of binary operators to guide; recursion. To start with, we need a table of precedences:. .. code-block:: c++. /// BinopPrecedence - This holds the precedence for each binary operator that is; /// defined.; static std::map<char, int> BinopPrecedence;. /// GetTokPrecedence - Get the precedence of the pending binary operator token.; static int GetTokPrecedence() {; if (!isascii(CurTok)); return -1;. // Make sure it's a declared binop.; int TokPrec = BinopPrecedence[CurTok];; if (TokPrec <= 0) return -1;; return TokPrec;; }. int main() {; // Install standard binary operators.; // 1 is lowest precedence.; BinopPrecedence['<'] = 10;; BinopPrecedence['+'] = 20;; BinopPrecedence['-'] = 20;; BinopPrecedence['*'] = 40; // highest.; ...; }. For the basic form of Kaleidoscope, we will only support 4 binary; operators (this can obviously be extended by you, our brave and intrepid; reader). The ``GetTokPrecedence`` function returns the precedence for; the current token, or -1 if the token is not a binary operator. Having a; map makes it easy to add new operators and makes it clear that the; algorithm doesn't depend on the specific operators involved, but it; would be easy enough to eliminate the map and do the comparisons in the; ``GetTokPrecedence`` function. (Or just use a fixed-size array). With the helper above defined, we can now start parsing binary; expressions. The basic idea of operator precedence parsing is to break; down an expression with potentially ambiguous binary operators into; pieces. Consider, for example, the expression ""a+b+(c+d)\*e\*f+g"".; Operator precedence parsing considers this as a stream of primary; expressions separated by binary operators. As such, it will first parse; the leading primary expression ""a"", then it will see the pairs [+, b]; [+, (c+d)] [\*, e] [\*, f] an",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst:13509,extend,extended,13509,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,1,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability," to Numeric Differentiation and works fine, since `; gamma_cdf()` doesn't have a lot of parameters. > In such cases, Numeric Differentiation fallback is only used for that; specific function. In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each of them). ### How do I test my new class while adding AD support?. Please look at the test classes that test the derivatives, evaluates,; fixtures, etc. (defined in 'roofit/roofitcore/test'). You can clone and adapt; these tests to your class as needed. For example:. > [roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx). > Tip: Tests like above can be referenced to see which parts of RooFit already; support AD. ### How do I control my compile time?.

To start ROOT you can type `root` at the system prompt. This starts up; Cling, the ROOT command line C/C++ interpreter, and it gives you the; ROOT prompt (`root[0]`). It is possible to launch ROOT with some command line options, as shown; below:. ```; % root -?; Usage: root [-l] [-b] [-n] [-q] [dir] [[file:]data.root]; [file1.C ... fileN.C]; Options:; -b : run in batch mode without graphics; -n : do not execute logon and logoff macros as specified in .rootrc; -q : exit after processing command line macro files; -l : do not show splash screen; -x : exit on exception; dir : if dir is a valid directory cd to it before executing. -? : print usage; -h : print usage; --help : print usage; -config : print ./configure options; ```. - -b ROOT session runs in batch mode, without graphics display.

Other contexts; implicitly push an address on the stack before evaluating an expression. For; example, the ``DW_AT_use_location`` attribute of the; ``DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type``. The expression belongs to a source language type; which may apply to objects allocated in different kinds of storage. Therefore,; it is desirable that the expression that uses the address can do so without; regard to what kind of storage it specifies, including the address space of a; memory location description. For example, a pointer to member value may want to; be applied to an object that may reside in any address space. The DWARF ``DW_OP_xderef*`` operations allow a value to be converted into an; address of a specified address space which is then read. But it provides no; way to create a memory location description for an address in the non-default; address space. For example, AMDGPU variables can be allocated in the local; address space at a fixed address. The ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-memory-location-description-operations`) operation is defined; to create a memory location description from an address and address space. If; can be used to specify the location of a variable that is allocated in a; specific address space. This allows the size of addresses in an address space to; be larger than the generic type. It also allows a consumer great implementation; freedom. It allows the implicit conversion back to a value to be limited only to; the default address space to maintain compatibility with DWARF Version 5. For; other address spaces the producer can use the new operations that explicitly; specify the address space. In contrast, if the ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` operation had been; defined to produce a value, and an implicit conversion to a memory location; description was defined, then it would be limited to the size of the generic; type (which m",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:19425,variab,variables,19425,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Blocks; ------. The implicit ``const`` capture variables created when evaluating a block; literal expression have the same ownership semantics as the local variables; they capture. The capture is performed by reading from the captured variable; and initializing the capture variable with that value; the capture variable is; destroyed when the block literal is, i.e. at the end of the enclosing scope. The :ref:`inference <arc.ownership.inference>` rules apply equally to; ``__block`` variables, which is a shift in semantics from non-ARC, where; ``__block`` variables did not implicitly retain during capture. ``__block`` variables of retainable object owner type are moved off the stack; by initializing the heap copy with the result of moving from the stack copy. With the exception of retains done as part of initializing a ``__strong``; parameter variable or reading a ``__weak`` variable, whenever these semantics; call for retaining a value of block-pointer type, it has the effect of a; ``Block_copy``. The optimizer may remove such copies when it sees that the; result is used only as an argument to a call. When a block pointer type is converted to a non-block pointer type (such as; ``id``), ``Block_copy`` is called.

Modifiability," to save a canvas into `file.xml` file; format instead of `file.root`. XML files do not have any advantages; compared to the normal ROOT files, except that the information in these; files can be edited via a normal editor. The main motivation for this; new format is to facilitate the communication with other non ROOT; applications. Currently writing and reading XML files is limited to ROOT; applications. It is our intention to develop a simple reader independent; of the ROOT libraries that could be used as an example for real; applications. The XML format should be used only for small data volumes, typically; histogram files, pictures, geometries, calibrations. The XML file is; built in memory before being dumped to disk. Like for normal ROOT files,; XML files use the same I/O mechanism exploiting the ROOT/Cling; dictionary. Any class having a dictionary can be saved in XML format.; This first implementation does not support subdirectories or trees. The shared library `libRXML.so` may be loaded dynamically via; `gSystem->Load(""libRXML"")`. This library is also automatically loaded by; the plug-in manager as soon a XML file is created. To create an XTM; file, simply specify a filename with an .xml extension when calling; **`TFile`**`::Open`. **`TFile`**`::Open` will recognize that you are trying to; open an XML file and return a **`TXMLFile`** object. When a XML file is; open in write mode, one can use the normal `TObject::Write` to write an; object in the file. ``` {.cpp}; // example of a session saving a histogram to a XML file; TFile *f = TFile::Open(""Example.xml"",""recreate"");; TH1F *h = new TH1F(""h"",""test"",1000,-2,2); h->FillRandom(""gaus"");; h->Write();; delete f;; // example of a session saving a histogram to a XML file; TFile *f = TFile::Open(""Example.xml"");; TH1F *h = (TH1F*)f->Get(""h"");; h->Draw();; ```.

Files included by ``@file`` directives in configuration files are resolved; relative to the including file. For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file. In cases where a configuration file is deployed alongside SDK contents, the; SDK directory can remain fully portable by using ``<CFGDIR>`` prefixed paths.; In this way, the user may only need to specify a root configuration file with; ``--config=`` to establish every aspect of the SDK with the compiler:. ::. --target=foo; -isystem <CFGDIR>/include; -L <CFGDIR>/lib; -T <CFGDIR>/ldscripts/link.ld.

Note that it is perfectly legal to index partially through a structure,; returning a pointer to an inner element. Because of this, the LLVM code; for the given testcase is equivalent to:. .. code-block:: llvm. define ptr @foo(ptr %s) {; %t1 = getelementptr %struct.ST, ptr %s, i32 1; %t2 = getelementptr %struct.ST, ptr %t1, i32 0, i32 2; %t3 = getelementptr %struct.RT, ptr %t2, i32 0, i32 1; %t4 = getelementptr [10 x [20 x i32]], ptr %t3, i32 0, i32 5; %t5 = getelementptr [20 x i32], ptr %t4, i32 0, i32 13; ret ptr %t5; }. The indices are first converted to offsets in the pointer's index type. If the; currently indexed type is a struct type, the struct offset corresponding to the; index is sign-extended or truncated to the pointer index type. Otherwise, the; index itself is sign-extended or truncated, and then multiplied by the type; allocation size (that is, the size rounded up to the ABI alignment) of the; currently indexed type.

The core of the minimization functionality and related tools (the kernel; of M ) should be clearly separated from the user, who is interfacing via; defined user interfaces (the API). ## Internal and external parameters ##. Each of the parameters to the $\mbox{FCN}$ is defined by the user as; belonging to one of the following types:. - Freely variable: allowed to take on any value. - Variable with double sided limits: allowed to vary only between two; limits specified by the user. - Variable with single sided limits: allowed to vary only between one; upper or one lower limit specified by the user and unlimited to the; other side. - Fixed: originally defined as variable, but now taking on only the; value the parameter had at the moment it was fixed, or a value later; assigned by the user. - Constant: taking on only one value as specified by the user.

Modifiability," use the ""alloca trick"". Once we have that, we'll add our new; operator, then extend Kaleidoscope to support new variable definitions. Adjusting Existing Variables for Mutation; =========================================. The symbol table in Kaleidoscope is managed at code generation time by; the '``NamedValues``' map. This map currently keeps track of the LLVM; ""Value\*"" that holds the double value for the named variable. In order; to support mutation, we need to change this slightly, so that; ``NamedValues`` holds the *memory location* of the variable in question.; Note that this change is a refactoring: it changes the structure of the; code, but does not (by itself) change the behavior of the compiler. All; of these changes are isolated in the Kaleidoscope code generator. At this point in Kaleidoscope's development, it only supports variables; for two things: incoming arguments to functions and the induction; variable of 'for' loops. For consistency, we'll allow mutation of these; variables in addition to other user-defined variables. This means that; these will both need memory locations. To start our transformation of Kaleidoscope, we'll change the; ``NamedValues`` map so that it maps to AllocaInst\* instead of Value\*. Once; we do this, the C++ compiler will tell us what parts of the code we need; to update:. .. code-block:: c++. static std::map<std::string, AllocaInst*> NamedValues;. Also, since we will need to create these allocas, we'll use a helper; function that ensures that the allocas are created in the entry block of; the function:. .. code-block:: c++. /// CreateEntryBlockAlloca - Create an alloca instruction in the entry block of; /// the function.

Modifiability," use the ``--coverage`` option, which; includes both of those other options.). At the time you compile the instrumented code, a ``.gcno`` data file will be; generated for each object file. These ``.gcno`` files contain half of the; coverage data. The other half of the data comes from ``.gcda`` files that are; generated when you run the instrumented program, with a separate ``.gcda``; file for each object file. Each time you run the program, the execution counts; are summed into any existing ``.gcda`` files, so be sure to remove any old; files if you do not want their contents to be included. By default, the ``.gcda`` files are written into the same directory as the; object files, but you can override that by setting the ``GCOV_PREFIX`` and; ``GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP`` environment variables. The ``GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP``; variable specifies a number of directory components to be removed from the; start of the absolute path to the object file directory. After stripping those; directories, the prefix from the ``GCOV_PREFIX`` variable is added. These; environment variables allow you to run the instrumented program on a machine; where the original object file directories are not accessible, but you will; then need to copy the ``.gcda`` files back to the object file directories; where :program:`llvm-cov gcov` expects to find them. Once you have generated the coverage data files, run :program:`llvm-cov gcov`; for each main source file where you want to examine the coverage results. This; should be run from the same directory where you previously ran the; compiler. The results for the specified source file are written to a file named; by appending a ``.gcov`` suffix.

Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`.

Modifiability," useful for modeling pointer values,; since we don't care about specific addresses but just want to give a unique; identifier to a memory location. ```c++; void ExampleOfSymbolicPointers(bool b) {; int x = 0; // x is {0}; int* ptr = &x; // x is {0} ptr is {&x}; if (b) {; *ptr = 42; // x is {42} ptr is {&x}; }; print(x); // x is {0; 42} ptr is {&x}; }; ```. ## Example: finding output parameters. Let's explore how data flow analysis can help with a problem that is hard to; solve with other tools in Clang. ### Problem description. Output parameters are function parameters of pointer or reference type whose; pointee is completely overwritten by the function, and not read before it is; overwritten. They are common in pre-C++11 code due to the absence of move; semantics. In modern C++ output parameters are non-idiomatic, and return values; are used instead. Imagine that we would like to refactor output parameters to return values to; modernize old code. The first step is to identify refactoring candidates through; static analysis. For example, in the following code snippet the pointer `c` is an output; parameter:. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; }. void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c->name = ...;; } else {; c->name = ...;; }; }; ```. We would like to refactor this code into:. ```c++; Customer GetCustomer() {; Customer c;; c.account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c.name = ...;; } else {; c.name = ...;; }; return c;; }; ```. However, in the function below the parameter `c` is not an output parameter; because its field `name` is not overwritten on every path through the function. ```c++; void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c->name = ...;; }; }; ```. The code also cannot read the value of the parameter before overwriting it:. ```c++; void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; use(c->account_id);; c->name = ...;; c->account_id = ...;; }; ```. Functions that escape the pointer also block the refactoring",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:14954,refactor,refactoring,14954,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

The `RooFit::TestStatistics` namespace contains a major refactoring of the `RooAbsTestStatistic`-`RooAbsOptTestStatistic`-`RooNLLVar` inheritance tree into:. 1. statistics-based classes on the one hand;; 2. calculation/evaluation/optimization based classes on the other hand. The main selling point of using `RooFit::TestStatistics` from a performance point of view is the implementation of the `RooFit::MultiProcess` based `LikelihoodGradientJob` calculator class.; To use it to perform a ""migrad"" fit (using Minuit2), one should create a `RooMinimizer` using a new constructor with a `RooAbsL` likelihood parameter as follows:. ```c++; using RooFit::TestStatistics::RooAbsL;; using RooFit::TestStatistics::buildLikelihood;.

For example, ``x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-clang-g++`` will attempt to load two; configuration files named respectively::. clang++.cfg; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.cfg. with fallback to trying::. clang-g++.cfg; x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.cfg. It is not an error if either of these files is not found. The configuration file consists of command-line options specified on one or; more lines. Lines composed of whitespace characters only are ignored as well as; lines in which the first non-blank character is ``#``. Long options may be split; between several lines by a trailing backslash. Here is example of a; configuration file:. ::. # Several options on line; -c --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. # Long option split between lines; -I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/../../../../\; include/c++/5.4.0. # other config files may be included; @linux.options. Files included by ``@file`` directives in configuration files are resolved; relative to the including file. For example, if a configuration file; ``~/.llvm/target.cfg`` contains the directive ``@os/linux.opts``, the file; ``linux.opts`` is searched for in the directory ``~/.llvm/os``. Another way to; include a file content is using the command line option ``--config=``. It works; similarly but the included file is searched for using the rules for configuration; files. To generate paths relative to the configuration file, the ``<CFGDIR>`` token may; be used. This will expand to the absolute path of the directory containing the; configuration file. In cases where a configuration file is deployed alongside SDK contents, the; SDK directory can remain fully portable by using ``<CFGDIR>`` prefixed paths.; In this way, the user may only need to specify a root configuration file with; ``--config=`` to establish every aspect of the SDK with the compiler:. ::. --target=foo; -isystem <CFGDIR>/include; -L <CFGDIR>/lib; -T <CFGDIR>/ldscripts/link.ld.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:34657,config,configuration,34657,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']

An example of the two-dimensional spectrum with the identified peaks is; shown in Figure 3.8. ![Two-dimensional spectrum with the identified peaks](figures/image072.png). We have also generalized the peak searching function similarly to one-dimensional data. The generalized peak searching function for two-dimensional spectra has the form of. ```{.cpp}; Int_t Search2General(float **source,; int sizex,; int sizey,; double sigma,; int threshold,; bool markov,; int aver_window);; ```. This function searches for peaks in the source spectrum. The number of found; peaks and their positions are written into the structure pointed by; `two_dim_peak` structure pointer. Function parameters:. - **`source`**: pointer to the vector of the source spectrum; - **`sizex`**: x length of the source spectrum; - **`sizey`**: y length of the source spectrum; - **`sigma`**: sigma of searched peaks; - **`threshold`**: threshold value for peaks selection; - **`markov`**: logical variable. If it is set to `true`, then the source spectrum is first replaced by the new spectrum calculated using Markov chains method; - **`aver_window`** averaging window of searched peaks (applies only for the Markov method).

Modifiability," very similar to; XML in some ways. Like XML, bitstream files contain tags, and nested; structures, and you can parse the file without having to understand the tags.; Unlike XML, the bitstream format is a binary encoding, and unlike XML it; provides a mechanism for the file to self-describe ""abbreviations"", which are; effectively size optimizations for the content. LLVM IR files may be optionally embedded into a `wrapper`_ structure, or in a; `native object file`_. Both of these mechanisms make it easy to embed extra; data along with LLVM IR files. This document first describes the LLVM bitstream format, describes the wrapper; format, then describes the record structure used by LLVM IR files. .. _bitstream container format:. Bitstream Format; ================. The bitstream format is literally a stream of bits, with a very simple; structure. This structure consists of the following concepts:. * A ""`magic number`_"" that identifies the contents of the stream. * Encoding `primitives`_ like variable bit-rate integers. * `Blocks`_, which define nested content. * `Data Records`_, which describe entities within the file. * Abbreviations, which specify compression optimizations for the file. Note that the :doc:`llvm-bcanalyzer <CommandGuide/llvm-bcanalyzer>` tool can be; used to dump and inspect arbitrary bitstreams, which is very useful for; understanding the encoding. .. _magic number:. Magic Numbers; -------------. The first four bytes of a bitstream are used as an application-specific magic; number. Generic bitcode tools may look at the first four bytes to determine; whether the stream is a known stream type. However, these tools should *not*; determine whether a bitstream is valid based on its magic number alone. New; application-specific bitstream formats are being developed all the time; tools; should not reject them just because they have a hitherto unseen magic number. .. _primitives:.

It's experimental, so expect problems. For example, when building with gcc,; manipulations in global variables in llvm will abort the build. Such checks can be disabled using environment variables. Check the address; sanitizer documentation or the link below for details. In clang, which allows to blacklist functions, the build will continue. See [core/sanitizer](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/core/sanitizer) for information. ### Optimization of ROOT header files. Many (but intentionally not all) unused includes were removed from ROOT header files. For instance, `#include ""TObjString.h""` and; `#include ""ThreadLocalStorage.h""` were removed from `TClass.h`.

Scudo further randomizes how; blocks are allocated in the Primary, can randomize how caches are assigned to; threads. Memory reclaiming; -----------------; Primary and Secondary allocators have different behaviors with regard to; reclaiming. While Secondary mapped allocations can be unmapped on deallocation,; it isn't the case for the Primary, which could lead to a steady growth of the; RSS of a process. To counteract this, if the underlying OS allows it, pages; that are covered by contiguous free memory blocks in the Primary can be; released: this generally means they won't count towards the RSS of a process and; be zero filled on subsequent accesses). This is done in the deallocation path,; and several options exist to tune this behavior. Usage; =====. Platform; --------; If using Fuchsia or an Android version greater than 11, your memory allocations; are already service by Scudo (note that Android Svelte configurations still use; jemalloc). Library; -------; The allocator static library can be built from the LLVM tree thanks to the; ``scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. The associated tests can be exercised thanks to; the ``check-scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. Linking the static library to your project can require the use of the; ``whole-archive`` linker flag (or equivalent), depending on your linker.; Additional flags might also be necessary. Your linked binary should now make use of the Scudo allocation and deallocation; functions. You may also build Scudo like this:. .. code:: console. cd $LLVM/compiler-rt/lib; clang++ -fPIC -std=c++17 -msse4.2 -O2 -pthread -shared \; -I scudo/standalone/include \; scudo/standalone/*.cpp \; -o $HOME/libscudo.so. and then use it with existing binaries as follows:. .. code:: console.

Modifiability," when there are; multiple matches. But it allows the call to obtain the location; description for a variable or formal parameter which may use a location; list expression. An alternative is to treat the case when D has a ``DW_AT_location``; attribute that is encoded as a ``loclist`` or ``loclistsptr``, and the; specified location list expression E' matches a single location list; entry with operation expression E, the same as the ``exprloc`` case and; evaluate on the same stack. But this is not attractive as if the attribute is for a variable that; happens to end with a non-singleton stack, it will not simply put a; location description on the stack. Presumably the intent of using; ``DW_OP_call*`` on a variable or formal parameter debugger information; entry is to push just one location description on the stack. That; location description may have more than one single location description. The previous rule for ``exprloc`` also has the same problem, as normally; a variable or formal parameter location expression may leave multiple; entries on the stack and only return the top entry. GDB implements ``DW_OP_call*`` by always executing E on the same stack.; If the location list has multiple matching entries, it simply picks the; first one and ignores the rest. This seems fundamentally at odds with; the desire to support multiple places for variables. So, it feels like ``DW_OP_call*`` should both support pushing a location; description on the stack for a variable or formal parameter, and also; support being able to execute an operation expression on the same stack.; Being able to specify a different operation expression for different; program locations seems a desirable feature to retain. A solution to that is to have a distinct ``DW_AT_LLVM_proc`` attribute; for the ``DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure`` debugging information entry.

On the other hand, it can; have the effect of leaving a lot of work for the developer of a novel; language. We try to mitigate this by providing built in collector strategy; descriptions that can work with many common collector designs and easy; extension points.

You can add others; using either the loadable plugin mechanism, or by patching your copy of LLVM.; It is the selected GC strategy which defines the exact nature of the code; generated to support GC. If none is found, the compiler will raise an error.

This array contains a list of; pointers to named global variables, functions and aliases which may optionally; have a pointer cast formed of bitcast or getelementptr. For example, a legal; use of it is:. .. code-block:: llvm. @X = global i8 4; @Y = global i32 123. @llvm.used = appending global [2 x ptr] [; ptr @X,; ptr @Y; ], section ""llvm.metadata"".

For the other collections,; see the class reference guide on the web and the test program; `$ROOTSYS/test/tcollex.cxx.`. ## Template Containers and STL. Some people dislike polymorphic containers because they are not truly; ""type safe"". In the end, the compiler leaves it the user to ensure that; the types are correct. This only leaves the other alternative: creating; a new class each time a new (container organization) / (contained; object) combination is needed. To say the least this could be very; tedious. Most people faced with this choice would, for each type of; container:. Define the class leaving a dummy name for the contained object type.; When a particular container was needed, copy the code and then do a; global search and replace for the contained class. C++ has a built in; template scheme that effectively does just this. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; template<class T>; class ArrayContainer {; private:; T *member[10];; ...; };; ```. This is an array container with a 10-element array of pointers to T, it; could hold up to 10 T objects. This array is flawed because it is static; and hard-coded, it should be dynamic. However, the important point is; that the template stat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:17993,polymorphi,polymorphic,17993,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,1,['polymorphi'],['polymorphic']

Here is a short demo:; ```python; import ROOT. with ROOT.TFile.Open(""my_file.root"", ""RECREATE"") as my_file:. # Populate the TFile with simple objects.; my_file.WriteObject(ROOT.std.string(""hello world""), ""my_string""); my_file.WriteObject(ROOT.vector[""int""]([1, 2, 3]), ""my vector""). print(my_file[""my_string""]) # new syntax; print(my_file.my_string) # old deprecated syntax. # With the dictionary syntax, you can also use names that don't qualify as; # a Python variable:; print(my_file[""my vector""]); # print(my_file.my vector) # the old syntax would not work here!; ```. The old pythonization with the `__getattr__` syntax still works, but emits a deprecation warning and will be removed from ROOT 6.34. ### Removal of Python 2 support. ROOT does no longer support Python 2. The minimum Python version necessary to use ROOT in a Python application is 3.8.; As a consequence, any reference to Python 2 in ROOT code was removed and certain configuration options are no longer; usable, e.g. * `root-config --python2-version`; * cmake -Dpyroot-python2. The cmake build system now looks for the standard `Python3` package and previously custom Python-related cmake variables; are now just the ones automatically produced by cmake (see https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html). ### More usage of the public cppyy API. Many implementation details of the ROOT pythonizations were moved from C++ functions to pure Python bindings using the; public cppyy API. This helps in the integration with the tool but also improves code efficiency and memory usage. ## Class Reference Guide. - Define missing doxygen groups.; - Fix a few typos in the `THStack` documentation.; - Small fixes in the `THistPainter` documentation.; - Improve the `TColor` documentation: use modern C++ in the examples.; - Make sure the python examples do not generate wrong namespaces in the documentation.; - The dataframe tutorials json sp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:22645,config,configuration,22645,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['config'],['configuration']
Modifiability," you have LLVM configured, you can build it by entering the *OBJ_ROOT*; directory and issuing the following command:. .. code-block:: console. % make. If the build fails, please `check here`_ to see if you are using a version of; GCC that is known not to compile LLVM. If you have multiple processors in your machine, you may wish to use some of the; parallel build options provided by GNU Make. For example, you could use the; command:. .. code-block:: console. % make -j2. There are several special targets which are useful when working with the LLVM; source code:. ``make clean``. Removes all files generated by the build. This includes object files,; generated C/C++ files, libraries, and executables. ``make install``. Installs LLVM header files, libraries, tools, and documentation in a hierarchy; under ``$PREFIX``, specified with ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, which; defaults to ``/usr/local``. ``make docs-llvm-html``. If configured with ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=On``, this will generate a directory; at ``OBJ_ROOT/docs/html`` which contains the HTML formatted documentation. Cross-Compiling LLVM; --------------------. It is possible to cross-compile LLVM itself. That is, you can create LLVM; executables and libraries to be hosted on a platform different from the platform; where they are built (a Canadian Cross build). To generate build files for; cross-compiling CMake provides a variable ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` which can; define compiler flags and variables used during the CMake test operations. The result of such a build is executables that are not runnable on the build; host but can be executed on the target. As an example the following CMake; invocation can generate build files targeting iOS. This will work on macOS; with the latest Xcode:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Ninja"" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=""armv7;armv7s;arm64""; -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<PATH_TO_LLVM>/cmake/platforms/iOS.cmake; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=Off -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=Off; -DLL",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst:30505,config,configured,30505,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,1,['config'],['configured']

This is unexpected, because one would expect that if two numbers are considered exactly equal, they would also be considered equal within any range.; Therefore, the behavior of `TMath::AreEqualAbs()` was changed to return always `true` if the `==` comparison would return `true`. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Changes in RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf. The TFormula-based RooFit classes `RooFormulaVar` and `RooGenericPdf` change a bit their behavior to be more consistent:. 1. No matter which variables you pass to the constructor, only the variables that the formula depends on are registered as value servers.; 2. Similarly, the `dependents()` method of RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf will only return the list of actual value servers. ### Removal of the RooGenFunction and RooMultiGenFunction classes. The `RooGenFunction` was only a lightweight adaptor that exports a RooAbsReal as a `ROOT::Math::IGenFunction`.; The same can be easily achieved with the generic `ROOT::Math::Functor1D`, so in the spirit of not duplicating interfaces, the `RooGenFunction` is removed in this release. Here is an example that shows how to replace it in the unlikely case you were using it:. ```C++; RooArgSet normSet{x}; // normalization set. // Old way 1: create a RooGenFunction:; RooGenFunction func1{pdf, x, {}, normSet};. // Old way 2: use `RooAbsReal::iGenFunction()`:; std::unique_ptr<ROOT::Math::IGenFunction> func2{; pdf.iGenFunction(x, normSet); };. // How to do it now:; RooFunctor functor{pdf, x, {}, normSet};; ROOT::Math::Functor1D func3{functor};; // Functor1D takes by reference, so the RooFunctor also needs to stay alive.; ```. For the same reason, the `RooMultiGenFunction` class that implements a multidimensional `ROOT::Math::IMultiGenFunction` is removed too.; It can easily be replaced by a `ROOT::Math::Functor`:. ```C++; RooFunctor functor{pdf, obse",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md:11704,adapt,adaptor,11704,README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,1,['adapt'],['adaptor']

It can be refactored to use `unique_ptr` like this:. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership2() {; auto pi = make_unique<int>();; Borrow(pi);; if (smth) {; pi = make_unique<int>();; Borrow(pi);; }; }; ```. In the following example, the raw pointer is used to access the heap object; after the ownership has been transferred. ```c++; void UniqueOwnership3() {; int *pi = new int; // pi is Defined; if (...) {; Borrow(pi);; delete pi; // pi is Compatible; } else {; vector<unique_ptr<int>> v = {std::unique_ptr(pi)}; // pi is Compatible; print(*pi);; use(v);; }; // pi is Compatible; }; ```.

Note that a location description is; defined over certain ranges of a program, i.e the location of a variable may; change over the course of the program. Register and memory location; descriptions describe the *concrete location* of a source variable (in the; sense that a debugger might modify its value), whereas *implicit locations*; describe merely the actual *value* of a source variable which might not exist; in registers or in memory (see ``DW_OP_stack_value``).

This is the signature of `TTree::Branch` to create a branch with a list; of variables:. ``` {.cpp}; TBranch* TTree::Branch(const char* name,void* address,; const char* leaflist,; Int_t bufsize = 32000); ```. The first parameter is the branch name. The second parameter is the; address from which to read the value. The third parameter is the leaf; list with the name and type of each leaf. In this example, each branch; has only one leaf. In the box below, the branch is named `px` and has; one floating point type leaf also called `px`. ``` {.cpp}; t1.Branch(""px"",&px,""px/F"");; ```. #### Filling the Tree. First we find some random values for the variables. We assign `px` and; `py` a Gaussian with mean = 0 and sigma = 1 by calling; `gRandom->Rannor(px,py)`, and calculate` pz`. Then we call the; `TTree::Fill()` method. The call `t1.Fill()` fills all branches in the; tree because we have already organized the tree into branches and told; each branch where to get the value from. After this script is executed; we have a ROOT file called `tree1.root` with a tree called `t1`. There; is a possibility to fill branches one by one using the method; `TBranch::Fill()`. In this case you do not need to call `TTree::Fill()`; method. The entries can be set by `TTree::SetEntries(Double_t n)`.; Calling this method makes sense only if the number of existing entries; is null. ### Viewing the Tree. ![The tree1.root file and its tree in the browser and a leaf histogram](pictures/030000FC.png).

Modifiability,"# A Little C++; \index{C++}. This chapter introduces you to some useful insights into C++, to allow; you to use some of the most advanced features in ROOT. It is in no case a; full course in C++. ## Classes, Methods and Constructors. C++ extends C with the notion of a class. If you're used to structures; in C, a class is a `struct` that is a group of related variables,; which is extended with functions and routines specific to this; structure (class). What is the interest? Consider a `struct` that is defined this way:. ``` {.cpp}; struct Line {; float x1;; float y1;; float x2;; float y2;; }; ```. This structure represents a line to be drawn in a graphical window.; `(x1,y1)` are the coordinates of the first point, `(x2,y2)` the; coordinates of the second point. In the standard C, if you want to; draw effectively such a line, you first have to define a structure and; initialize the points (you can try this):. ``` {.cpp}; Line firstline;; firstline.x1 = 0.2;; firstline.y1 = 0.2;; firstline.x2 = 0.8;; firstline.y2 = 0.9;; ```. This defines a line going from the point `(0.2,0.2)` to the point; `(0.8,0.9)`. To draw this line, you will have to write a function, say; `LineDraw(Line l)` and call it with your object as argument:. ``` {.cpp}; LineDraw(firstline);; ```. In C++, we would not do that. We would instead define a class like this:. ``` {.cpp}; class TLine {; Double_t x1;; Double_t y1;; Double_t x2;; Double_t y2;; TLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);; void Draw();; }; ```. Here we added two functions, that we will call methods or member; functions, to the **`TLine`** class. The first method is used for; initializing the line objects we would build. It is called a; constructor. The second one is the `Draw` method itself. Therefore, to; build and draw a line, we have to do:. ``` {.cpp}; TLine l(0.2,0.2,0.8,0.9);; l.Draw();; ```. The first line builds the object `l` by calling its constructor. The; second line calls the **`TLine`**`::Draw()` method of this object.

Modifiability,"# Appendix A: Install and Build ROOT; \index{install ROOT}. ## License. ROOT is made available under the LGPL v2.1 license. For full details see; the file LICENSE in the ROOT distribution. ## Installing ROOT. To install ROOT you will need to go to the ROOT website at:; <https://root.cern/install/>. You have a choice to download the binaries or the source. The source is; quicker to transfer since it is only 31 MB, but you will need to compile; and link it. The binaries range from 50 MB to 100 MB depending on the; target platform. ## Choosing a Version. The ROOT developers follow the principle of ""release early and release; often"", however a very large portion of a user base requires a stable; product therefore generally three versions of the system is available; for download - new, old and pro:. - The *new* version evolves quickly, with weekly or bi-weekly; releases. Use this to get access to the latest and greatest, but it; may not be stable. By trying out the new version you can help us; converge quickly to a stable version that can then become the new; pro version. If you are a new user we would advice you to try the; new version. - The *pro* (production) version is a version we feel comfortable with; to exposing to a large audience for serious work. The change rate of; this version is much lower than for the new version, it is about 3; to 6 months. - The *old* version is the previous pro version that people might need; for some time before switching the new pro version. The old change; rate is the same as for pro. ## Installing Precompiled Binaries. The binaries are available for downloading from; <https://root.cern/install/>. Once downloaded; you need to unzip and de-tar the file. For example, if you have; downloaded ROOT v5.30 for Linux-SLC5:. ``` {.cpp}; % gunzip root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar.gz; % tar xvf root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar; ```.

Modifiability,"# C++ Modules in ROOT. Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:685,config,configure,685,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['config'],['configure']
Modifiability,"# Collection Classes. Collections are a key feature of the ROOT system. Many, if not most, of; the applications you write will use collections. If you have used; parameterized C++ collections or polymorphic collections before, some of; this material will be review. However, much of this chapter covers; aspects of collections specific to the ROOT system. When you have read; this chapter, you will know. - How to create instances of collections. - The difference between lists, arrays, hash tables, maps, etc. - How to add and remove elements of a collection. - How to search a collection for a specific element. - How to access and modify collection elements. - How to iterate over a collection to access collection elements. - How to manage memory for collections and collection elements. - How collection elements are tested for equality (`IsEqual(`)). - How collection elements are compared (`Compare())` in case of sorted; collections. - How collection elements are hashed (`Hash()`) in hash tables. ## Understanding Collections. A collection is a group of related objects. You will find it easier to; manage a large number of items as a collection. For example, a diagram; editor might manage a collection of points and lines. A set of widgets; for a graphical user interface can be placed in a collection. A; geometrical model can be described by collections of shapes, materials; and rotation matrices. Collections can themselves be placed in; collections. Collections act as flexible alternatives to traditional; data structures of computers science such as arrays, lists and trees. ### General Characteristics. The ROOT collections are polymorphic containers that hold pointers to; `TObjects`, so:. - They can only hold objects that inherit from **`TObject`**. - They return pointers to `TObjects`, that have to be cast back to the; correct subclass. Collections are dynamic; they can grow in size as required.

Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions.

Modifiability,"# Debug Info Assignment Tracking. Assignment Tracking is an alternative technique for tracking variable location; debug info through optimisations in LLVM. It provides accurate variable; locations for assignments where a local variable (or a field of one) is the; LHS. In rare and complicated circumstances indirect assignments might be; optimized away without being tracked, but otherwise we make our best effort to; track all variable locations. The core idea is to track more information about source assignments in order; and preserve enough information to be able to defer decisions about whether to; use non-memory locations (register, constant) or memory locations until after; middle end optimisations have run. This is in opposition to using; `llvm.dbg.declare` and `llvm.dbg.value`, which is to make the decision for most; variables early on, which can result in suboptimal variable locations that may; be either incorrect or incomplete. A secondary goal of assignment tracking is to cause minimal additional work for; LLVM pass writers, and minimal disruption to LLVM in general. ## Status and usage. **Status**: Experimental work in progress. Enabling is strongly advised against; except for development and testing. **Enable in Clang**: `-Xclang -fexperimental-assignment-tracking`. That causes Clang to get LLVM to run the pass `declare-to-assign`. The pass; converts conventional debug intrinsics to assignment tracking metadata and sets; the module flag `debug-info-assignment-tracking` to the value `i1 true`. To; check whether assignment tracking is enabled for a module call; `isAssignmentTrackingEnabled(const Module &M)` (from `llvm/IR/DebugInfo.h`). ## Design and implementation. ### Assignment markers: `llvm.dbg.assign`. `llvm.dbg.value`, a conventional debug intrinsic, marks out a position in the; IR where a variable takes a particular value. Similarly, Assignment Tracking; marks out the position of assignments with a new intrinsic called; `llvm.dbg.assign`.

We continue by; using the command line, and explaining the coding conventions, global; variables and the environment setup. If you have not installed ROOT,; you can do so by following the instructions in the appendix, or on the; ROOT web site: <http://root.cern.ch/root/Availability.html>. ## Setting the Environment Variables. Before you can run ROOT you need to set the environment variable; `ROOTSYS` and change your path to include `root/bin` and library path; variables to include `root/lib`. Please note: the syntax is for; `bash`, if you are running `tcsh` you will have to use `setenv`; instead of `export`. 1. Define the variable \$ROOTSYS to the directory where you unpacked; the ROOT:. ```; $ export ROOTSYS=$HOME/root; ```. 2. Add ROOTSYS/bin to your PATH:. ```; $ export PATH=$PATH:$ROOTSYS/bin; ```. 3. Setting the Library Path. On HP-UX, before executing the interactive module, you must set the; library path:. ```; $ export SHLIB_PATH=$SHLIB_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib; ```. On AIX, before executing the interactive module, you must set the; library path:. ```; $ [ -z ""$LIBPATH"" ] && export LIBPATH=/lib:/usr/lib; $ export LIBPATH=$LIBPATH:$ROOTSYS/lib; ```. On Linux, Solaris, Alpha OSF and SGI, before executing the interactive; module, you must set the library path:. ```; $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib; ```. On Solaris, in case your LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is empty, you should set; it:. ```; $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib:/usr/dt/lib; ```.

Modifiability,"# Graphs. A graph is a graphics object made of two arrays X and Y, holding the; x,y coordinates of `n` points. There are several graph classes; they; are **`TGraph`**, **`TGraphErrors`**, **`TGraphAsymmErrors`**, and; **`TMultiGraph`**. ## TGraph. The **`TGraph`** class supports the general case with non-equidistant; points, and the special case with equidistant points. Graphs are; created with the **`TGraph`** constructor. First, we define the arrays; of coordinates and then create the graph. The coordinates can be; arrays of doubles or floats. ``` {.cpp}; Int_t n = 20;; Double_t x[n], y[n];; for (Int_t i=0; i<n; i++) {; x[i] = i*0.1;; y[i] = 10*sin(x[i]+0.2);; }; TGraph *gr1 = new TGraph (n, x, y);; ```. An alternative constructor takes only the number of points `n`. It is; expected that the coordinates will be set later. ``` {.cpp}; TGraph *gr2 = new TGraph(n);; ```. The default constructor can also be used. Further calls to; `SetPoint()` will extend the internal vectors. ``` {.cpp}; TGraph *gr3 = new TGraph();; ```. ### Graph Draw Options. The various drawing options for a graph are explained in; `TGraph::PaintGraph`. They are:. - ""`L`"" A simple poly-line between every points is drawn. - ""`F`"" A fill area is drawn. - ""`F1`"" Idem as ""`F`"" but fill area is no more repartee around; X=0 or Y=0. - ""`F2`"" draw a fill area poly line connecting the center of bins. - ""`A`"" Axis are drawn around the graph. - ""`C`"" A smooth curve is drawn. - ""`*`"" A star is plotted at each point. - ""`P`"" The current marker of the graph is plotted at each point. - ""`B`"" A bar chart is drawn at each point. - ""`[]` "" Only the end vertical/horizontal lines of the error bars; are drawn. This option only applies to the; **`TGraphAsymmErrors`**. - ""`1`"" `ylow` `=` `rwymin`. The options are not case sensitive and they can be concatenated in; most cases.

Modifiability,"# Histograms #. Histograms play a fundamental role in any type of physics analysis, not; only to visualise measurements but being a powerful form of data; reduction. ROOT offers many classes that represent histograms, all; inheriting from the `TH1` class. We will focus in this chapter on uni-; and bi- dimensional histograms the bin contents of which are represented by; floating point numbers [^4], the `TH1F` and `TH2F` classes respectively. ## Your First Histogram ##. Let's suppose you want to measure the counts of a Geiger detector located in; proximity of a radioactive source in a given time interval. This would; give you an idea of the activity of your source. The count distribution; in this case is a Poisson distribution. Let's see how operatively you; can fill and draw a histogram with the following example macro. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro5.C; ```. Which gives you the following plot (Figure [5.1](#f51)):. [f51]: figures/poisson.png ""f51""; <a name=""f51""></a>. ![The result of a counting (pseudo) experiment. Only bins corresponding; to integer values are filled given the discrete nature of the poissonian; distribution. \label{f51}][f51]. Using histograms is rather simple. The main differences with respect to; graphs that emerge from the example are:. - line *5*: The histograms have a name and a title right from the; start, no predefined number of entries but a number of bins and a; lower-upper range. - line *15*: An entry is stored in the histogram through the; `TH1F::Fill` method. - line *18* and *21*: The histogram can be drawn also normalised, ROOT; automatically takes cares of the necessary rescaling. - line *24* to *30*: This small snippet shows how easy it is to access; the moments and associated errors of a histogram. ## Add and Divide Histograms ##.

Modifiability,"# Instruction referencing for debug info. This document explains how LLVM uses value tracking, or instruction; referencing, to determine variable locations for debug info in the code; generation stage of compilation. This content is aimed at those working on code; generation targets and optimisation passes. It may also be of interest to anyone; curious about low-level debug info handling. # Problem statement. At the end of compilation, LLVM must produce a DWARF location list (or similar); describing what register or stack location a variable can be found in, for each; instruction in that variable's lexical scope. We could track the virtual; register that the variable resides in through compilation, however this is; vulnerable to register optimisations during regalloc, and instruction; movements. # Solution: instruction referencing. Rather than identify the virtual register that a variable value resides in,; instead in instruction referencing mode, LLVM refers to the machine instruction; and operand position that the value is defined in. Consider the LLVM IR way of; referring to instruction values:. ```llvm; %2 = add i32 %0, %1; call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %2,; ```. In LLVM IR, the IR Value is synonymous with the instruction that computes the; value, to the extent that in memory a Value is a pointer to the computing; instruction. Instruction referencing implements this relationship in the; codegen backend of LLVM, after instruction selection. Consider the X86 assembly; below and instruction referencing debug info, corresponding to the earlier; LLVM IR:. ```text; %2:gr32 = ADD32rr %0, %1, implicit-def $eflags, debug-instr-number 1; DBG_INSTR_REF 1, 0, !123, !456, debug-location !789; ```. While the function remains in SSA form, virtual register `%2` is sufficient to; identify the value computed by the instruction -- however the function; eventually leaves SSA form, and register optimisations will obscure which; register the desired value is in.

The Parallel ROOT Facility, PROOF, is an extension of ROOT allowing; transparent analysis of large sets of ROOT files in parallel on remote; computer clusters or multi-core computers. The main design goals for the; PROOF system are:. *Transparency* : there should be as little difference as possible; between a local ROOT based analysis session and a remote parallel PROOF; session, both being interactive and giving the same results. *Scalability* : the basic architecture should not put any implicit; limitations on the number of computers that can be used in parallel. *Adaptability* : the system should be able to adapt itself to variations; in the remote environment (changing load on the cluster nodes, network; interruptions, etc.). Being an extension of the ROOT system, PROOF is designed to work on; objects in ROOT data stores, though, for the time being, it mainly; addresses the case of **`TTree`** based object collections. PROOF is primarily meant as an interactive alternative to batch systems; for Central Analysis Facilities and departmental workgroups (Tier-2's).; However, thanks to a multi-tier architecture allowing multiple levels of; masters, it can be easily adapted to wide range virtual clusters; distributed over geographically separated domains and heterogeneous; machines (GRIDs).

Modifiability,"# Preface {.unnumbered}. In late 1994, we decided to learn; and investigate Object Oriented programming and C++ to better judge; the suitability of these relatively new techniques for scientific; programming. We knew that there is no better way to learn a new; programming environment than to use it to write a program that can; solve a real problem. After a few weeks, we had our first; histogramming package in C++. A few weeks later we had a rewrite of; the same package using the, at that time, very new template features; of C++. Again, a few weeks later we had another rewrite of the package; without templates since we could only compile the version with; templates on one single platform using a specific compiler. Finally,; after about four months we had a histogramming package that was faster; and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based HBOOK; histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new; technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born; ROOT. Since its first public release at the end of 1995, ROOT has; enjoyed an ever-increasing popularity. Currently it is being used in; all major High Energy and Nuclear Physics laboratories around the; world to monitor, to store and to analyse data. In the other sciences; as well as the medical and financial industries, many people are using; ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several thousand; people. In 1997, Eric Raymond analysed in his paper ""The Cathedral and; the Bazaar"" the development method that makes Linux such a success.; The essence of that method is: ""release early, release often and; listen to your customers"". This is precisely how ROOT is being; developed. Over the last five years, many of our ""customers"" became; co-developers. Here we would like to thank our main co-developers and; contributors:. **Masaharu Goto** wrote the C++ interpreter CINT that was an; essential part of ROOT before ROOT 6.

Modifiability,"# Python Interface; \index{Python}. Python is a popular, open-source, dynamic programming language with an; interactive interpreter. Its interoperability with other programming; languages, both for extending Python as well as embedding it, is; excellent and many existing third-party applications and libraries have; therefore so-called ""Python bindings."" PyROOT provides Python bindings; for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice; versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of; user-level objects from one interpreter to the other. PyROOT enables; access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python; bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from; the python interpreter. ## PyROOT Overview. The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming,; including high performance and distributed parallel code (see; <http://www.scipy.org>). It is the second most popular scripting; language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a ""glue language"":; practically every library and application these days comes with Python; bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated). `PyROOT`, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT; class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it; allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus; the ""glue-ing"" of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or; applications that provide Python bindings. Further, `PyROOT` can be; loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary); access to Python classes. The best way to understand the benefits of; `PyROOT` is through a few examples. ### Glue-ing Applications. The `PyQt` library, see <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt>,; provides Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI framework (; <http://www.trolltech.com>).

Modifiability,"# Threads. A thread is an independent flow of control that operates within the same; address space as other independent flows of controls within a process.; In most UNIX systems, thread and process characteristics are grouped; into a single entity called a process. Sometimes, threads are called; ""lightweight processes''. Note: This introduction is adapted from the AIX 4.3 Programmer's Manual. ## Threads and Processes. In traditional single-threaded process systems, a process has a set of; properties. In multi-threaded systems, these properties are divided; between processes and threads. ### Process Properties. A process in a multi-threaded system is the changeable entity. It must; be considered as an execution frame. It has all traditional process; attributes, such as:. - Process ID, process group ID, user ID, and group ID. - Environment. - Working directory. A process also provides a common address space and common system; resources:. - File descriptors. - Signal actions. - Shared libraries. - Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes,; semaphores, or shared memory). ### Thread Properties. A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that; are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include; the following properties:. - Stack. - Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority). - Set of pending and blocked signals. - Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, `errno`. In; multi-threaded systems, `errno` is no longer a global variable, but; usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread.

Modifiability,"# Trees. ## Why Should You Use a Tree?. In the ""Input/Output"" chapter, we saw how objects can be saved in ROOT; files. In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects,; ROOT has designed the **`TTree`** and **`TNtuple`** classes specifically; for that purpose. The **`TTree`** class is optimized to reduce disk; space and enhance access speed. A **`TNtuple`** is a **`TTree`** that is; limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a **`TTree`** on the other; hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to; all the simple types. When using a **`TTree`**, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and; the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and; leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is; important to realize that each object is not written individually, but; rather collected and written a bunch at a time. This is where the **`TTree`** takes advantage of compression and will; produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written; individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the; **`TTree`** contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects; can be compressed. The **`TTree`** reduces the header of each object, but it still contains; the class name. Using compression, the class name of each same-class; object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression; algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using; a **`TTree`** and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes; compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned; off, you will not see these large savings. The **`TTree`** is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a; hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from; any other branch. Now, assume that `Px` and `Py` are data members of the; event, and we would like to compute `Px2 + Py2` for every event; and histogram the result.

Modifiability,"# Web-based display. In this chapter discussed how web-based display can be created in the ROOT. ## Basics. Idea of web displays is implementation of user interface, which can run remotely; or locally in the web-browsers, fully decoupled from the application code.; For the communication between application and browser websockets are used. ## Creating web-window. **`ROOT::RWebWindow`** class is represent window instance, which can be displayed in the browser. ```{.cpp}. auto win = ROOT::RWebWindow::Create();. // set HTML page which is showed when window displayed; win->SetDefaultPage(""file:page.html""); // set. // allow unlimitted user connections to the window (default only 1); win->SetConnLimit(0);. // configure predefined geometry; win->SetGeometry(300, 300);. ```. ## Communication. To receive data from the browser, data callback should be assigned.; Callback is invoked when data received from the client or when connection is established.; Normally lambda function is used:. ```{.cpp}. win->SetDataCallBack([](unsigned connid, const std::string &msg) {. printf(""Msg:%s from connection:%u\n"", msg.c_str(), connid);. });. ```.

Modifiability,"# rootreadspeed. `rootreadspeed` is a tool used to help identify bottlenecks in root analysis programs; by providing an idea of what throughput you can expect when reading ROOT files in; certain configurations. It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files,; how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread. ## Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:. Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually; saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total; number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data).; Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree.; Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including; decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. ## Interpreting results:. ### There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. - The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis,; ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time.; The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code (or the framework's),; parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible (for example with; [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html); and [EnableImplicitMT](https://root.cern/doc/master/namespaceROOT.html#a06f2b8b216b615e5abbc872c9feff40f)); or switch to a machine with a more performant CPU.; - The 'Real Time' is significantly higher than 'CPU Time / number of threads'*.; If the real time is higher than the CPU time per core it implies the reading of data is the; bottleneck, as the CPU cores are wasting time waiting for data to arrive from your disk/drive; or network connection in order to decompress it.; The best way to dec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:195,config,configurations,195,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['config'],['configurations']

If you call `TTree::SetBranchAddress` with NumPy array or `array.array` inputs, ROOT will now check if the array type matches with the column type.; If it doesn't, `SetBranchAddress()` will return a negative status code and print an error.; Take for example this code snippet:; ```python; arr = array.array(typecode, ""d""); status = t.SetBranchAddress(""name"", arr); print(""Status = %s"" % (status, )); ```; If the branch type is also `double` (like the type of the array indicated by `""d""`), the call to `SetBranchAddress()` would succeed with status code zero.; If the type doesn't match, you now get a clear error instead of garbage values.; ```txt; Error in <TTree::SetBranchAddress>: The pointer type given ""Double_t"" (8) does not correspond to the type needed ""Float_t"" (5) by the branch: a; Status = -2; ```. ### Deprecation of `TPython::Eval()`. The `TPython::Eval()` method is deprecated and scheduled for removal in ROOT 6.36.; Its implementation was fragile, and the same functionality can be achieved with `TPython::Exec()`, using a C++ variable that is known to the ROOT interpreter for crossing over from Python to C++.

Modifiability,"## Configuration for the address sanitizer.; When built with `-Dasan=ON`, build flags for address sanitizer are added to ROOT's build setup. In this directory, an additional library is created; that holds default sanitizer configs for ROOT executables. It e.g. contains suppressions for leak sanitizer, which automatically runs with address; sanitizer. When asan starts up, it checks if somebody defined the symbols in `SanitizerConfig.cxx`. In the standard asan runtime, these; functions are weak symbols, i.e. one can just override them with the desired configuration. That's what's happening here. This can be achieved in two ways:; 1. `LD_PRELOAD`: A micro library `libROOTSanitizerConfig.<dylib|so>` is created with the setup in this folder, and can be found in `<builddir>/lib/`.; Loading it with `LD_PRELOAD` will bring ROOT's default sanitiser config into any non-sanitised executable, e.g. python.; 2. ROOT executables will get the config automatically, using a static version of the config library, `libROOTStaticSanitizerConfig.a`.; All ROOT executables statically link against it, so they start up without reporting lots of unfixable memory leaks (e.g. llvm). #### Small linker magic to get the config symbols into ROOT's executables; When linking a ROOT executable, the setup functions from the sanitiser config library might get ignored, because they are not used in any of our executables.; In `cmake/modules/SetUp{Linux|MacOS}.cmake`, the functions are therefore marked as ""undefined"" for the linker, so it starts copying; them into all ROOT executables.; This way, root.exe, cling, ... can start up with a sane default config. ### Use your own address/leak sanitizer configuration; The default configurations can be overridden using the environment variables `ASAN_OPTIONS` and `LSAN_OPTIONS`.

Also it is possible to zoom a 2D histogram with a shaded rectangle. ### Saving Files; - When saving files from a canvas, the default file type is now .pdf instead of .ps, since pdf is probably becoming more popular than ps.; - In the ""File Save Dialog"", there is now a default file name and its extension (if a specific one is selected), and the name is highlighted, so when the user types something, only the file name is changed.; - The default file type can be changed with a new `Canvas.SaveAsDefaultType` option in `etc/system.rootrc` (default being pdf). ### ROOT browser and pad editor; - The Pad Editor is now embedded in the left tab of the browser instead of inside the canvas itself, so the layout of the canvas remains untouched when opening the editor.

Refer to it if you want more details. This tutorial will cover:; * Classes; * Defs; * Basic types; * `let` in various forms; * Class template arguments. ## What is TableGen?. TableGen is a language used in LLVM to automate the generation of certain types of code. Usually repetitive code that has a common structure. TableGen is used to generate ""records"" that are then processed by a ""backend"" into domain specific code. The compiler for TableGen is the binary `llvm-tblgen`. This contains the logic to convert TableGen source into records that can then be passed to a TableGen backend. TableGen allows you to define Classes and Defs (which are instances of classes) but it doesn't encode what to do with that structure. That's what the backend does. The backend converts this structure into something useful, for example C++ code. These backends are included in the `llvm-tblgen` binary and you can choose which one to run using a command line option. If you don't choose a backend you get a dump of the structure, and that is what this notebook will be showing. This tutorial will focus on the language itself only. The only thing you need to know now is that in addition to `llvm-tblgen` you will see other `*-tblgen` like `clang-tblgen`. The difference between them is the backends they include. The default output from `llvm-tblgen` looks like this:. ```tablegen; %config cellreset on. // Empty source file; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; ------------- Defs -----------------. **Note:** `%config` is not a TableGen command but a ""magic"" command to the Jupyter kernel for this notebook. By default new cells include the content of previously run cells, but for this notebook we mostly want each to be isolated. On occasion we will use the `%noreset` magic to override this.

Compared to the current support of S3 in ROOT (basically the class; TAS3File), the modifications include the improvements below:. - add support for using HTTPS : you can use different schemas for; specifying the underlying transport protocol to use ""s3:"",; ""s3http:"", ""s3https:"" [""s3"" uses HTTPS].

Variable values are identified by a pair of; instruction number and operand number.

Instruction numbers are directly attached to machine instructions with an; optional ``debug-instr-number`` attachment, before the optional; ``debug-location`` attachment. The value defined in ``$rbp`` in the code; above would be identified by the pair ``<1, 0>``. The 3rd operand of the ``DBG_INSTR_REF`` above records the instruction; and operand number ``<1, 0>``, identifying the value defined by the ``MOV64ri``.; The first two operands to ``DBG_INSTR_REF`` are identical to ``DBG_VALUE_LIST``,; and the ``DBG_INSTR_REF`` s position records where the variable takes on the; designated value in the same way.

Modifiability,"'<'] = 10;; BinopPrecedence['+'] = 20;; BinopPrecedence['-'] = 20;. Now that the parser knows the precedence of the binary operator, it; takes care of all the parsing and AST generation. We just need to; implement codegen for the assignment operator. This looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *BinaryExprAST::codegen() {; // Special case '=' because we don't want to emit the LHS as an expression.; if (Op == '=') {; // This assume we're building without RTTI because LLVM builds that way by; // default. If you build LLVM with RTTI this can be changed to a; // dynamic_cast for automatic error checking.; VariableExprAST *LHSE = static_cast<VariableExprAST*>(LHS.get());; if (!LHSE); return LogErrorV(""destination of '=' must be a variable"");. Unlike the rest of the binary operators, our assignment operator doesn't; follow the ""emit LHS, emit RHS, do computation"" model. As such, it is; handled as a special case before the other binary operators are handled.; The other strange thing is that it requires the LHS to be a variable. It; is invalid to have ""(x+1) = expr"" - only things like ""x = expr"" are; allowed. .. code-block:: c++. // Codegen the RHS.; Value *Val = RHS->codegen();; if (!Val); return nullptr;. // Look up the name.; Value *Variable = NamedValues[LHSE->getName()];; if (!Variable); return LogErrorV(""Unknown variable name"");. Builder->CreateStore(Val, Variable);; return Val;; }; ... Once we have the variable, codegen'ing the assignment is; straightforward: we emit the RHS of the assignment, create a store, and; return the computed value. Returning a value allows for chained; assignments like ""X = (Y = Z)"". Now that we have an assignment operator, we can mutate loop variables; and arguments. For example, we can now run code like this:. ::. # Function to print a double.; extern printd(x);. # Define ':' for sequencing: as a low-precedence operator that ignores operands; # and just returns the RHS.; def binary : 1 (x y) y;. def test(x); printd(x) :; x = 4 :; printd(x);",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:21540,variab,variable,21540,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"'``--``' marker. When the user specifies '``--``' on the; command line, it is telling the program that all options after the '``--``'; should be treated as positional arguments, not options. Thus, we can use it; like this:. ::. $ spiffygrep -- -foo test.txt; ...output... Determining absolute position with getPosition(); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes an option can affect or modify the meaning of another option. For; example, consider ``gcc``'s ``-x LANG`` option. This tells ``gcc`` to ignore the; suffix of subsequent positional arguments and force the file to be interpreted; as if it contained source code in language ``LANG``. In order to handle this; properly, you need to know the absolute position of each argument, especially; those in lists, so their interaction(s) can be applied correctly. This is also; useful for options like ``-llibname`` which is actually a positional argument; that starts with a dash. So, generally, the problem is that you have two ``cl::list`` variables that; interact in some way. To ensure the correct interaction, you can use the; ``cl::list::getPosition(optnum)`` method. This method returns the absolute; position (as found on the command line) of the ``optnum`` item in the; ``cl::list``. The idiom for usage is like this:. .. code-block:: c++. static cl::list<std::string> Files(cl::Positional, cl::OneOrMore);; static cl::list<std::string> Libraries(""l"");. int main(int argc, char**argv) {; // ...; std::vector<std::string>::iterator fileIt = Files.begin();; std::vector<std::string>::iterator libIt = Libraries.begin();; unsigned libPos = 0, filePos = 0;; while ( 1 ) {; if ( libIt != Libraries.end() ); libPos = Libraries.getPosition( libIt - Libraries.begin() );; else; libPos = 0;; if ( fileIt != Files.end() ); filePos = Files.getPosition( fileIt - Files.begin() );; else; filePos = 0;. if ( filePos != 0 && (libPos == 0 || filePos < libPos) ) {; // Source File Is next; ++fileIt;; }; else if ( libPos != 0 && (filePos ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:29374,variab,variables,29374,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

For example `y:x>>pf` where `pf `is an existing; **`TProfile`** histogram. #### Tree Information. Once we have drawn a tree, we can get information about the tree. These; are the methods used to get information from a drawn tree **`TTree`**:. - `GetSelectedRows`: Returns the number of entries accepted by the; selection expression. In case where no selection was specified, it; returns the number of entries processed. - `GetV1`: Returns a pointer to the float array of the first variable. - `GetV2`: Returns a pointer to the float array of second variable. - `GetV3`: Returns a pointer to the float array of third variable. - `GetW`: Returns a pointer to the float array of Weights where the; weight equals the result of the selection expression. To read the drawn values of `fNtrack` into an array, and loop through; the entries follow the lines below. First, open the file and draw the; `fNtrack` variable:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root""); root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack""); ```. Then declare a pointer to a float and use the GetV1 method to retrieve; the first dimension of the tree. In this example we only drew one; dimension (`fNtrack`) if we had drawn two, we could use GetV2 to get the; second one. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Float_t *a; root[] a = T->GetV1(); ```. Loop through the first 10 entries and print the values of `fNtrack`:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++); root[] cout << a[i] << "" "" << endl // need an endl to see the values; 594 597 606 595 604 610 604 602 603 596; ```. By default, `TTree::Draw` creates these arrays with `fEstimate` words; where `fEstimate` can be set via `TTree::SetEstimate`.

Implement the Log option for `CANDLE` plots as requested; [here](https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20225&p=87006#p87006). ### TTeXDump. From Dmitry Kalinkin (via github): Fix file corruption in `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker`; The current implementation of `TTeXDump` uses `TVirtualPS::PrintFast` based methods; to output TeX markup with automatic line-wraps. Yet these methods are optimized for; PostScript format where there are a lot of space characters that are used for newline; placement. Current `TTeXDump::DrawPolyMarker` would often produce a long contiguous lines; that trigger a forceful linewrap that can happen in the middle of real number constant; (ignored by latex) or even in the middle of latex command (producing incorrect file).; One solution would be to rewrite TTeXDump using only `PrintRaw` (that you can't mix; with `PrintStr/PrintFast/WriteReal`). The other would be to fix `PrintFast` to not; introduce forced newline. The third option is less intrusive and just adds additional; spaces to provide clues for the proper line wrapping (this is the one implemented in; this change). ### TLatex. Make sure the line width used to draw `#sqrt` is always >= 1. When a global text alignment was set the `TLatex`characters `#minus`, `#plus`,; `#mp`, `#hbar`, and `#backslash` were mis-aligned. The following macro demonstrate; the problem:. ``` {.cpp}; {; gStyle->SetTextAlign(22);; TLatex t(.5,.5,""#minus100 #mp100 #plus100 #hbar #backslash"");; t.Draw();; }; ```. The angle of a `TLatex` object was set to 0 if the `GetYsize` method was called. ### TColor. New palette `kViridis`. It was presented at SciPy2015 by Stéfan van der Walt and; Nathaniel Smith.

Refactoring Action Rules; ------------------------. An individual refactoring action is responsible for creating the set of; grouped refactoring action rules that represent one refactoring operation.; Although the rules in one action may have a number of different implementations,; they should strive to produce a similar result. It should be easy for users to; identify which refactoring action produced the result regardless of which; refactoring action rule was used. The distinction between actions and rules enables the creation of actions; that define a set of different rules that produce similar results. For example,; the ""add missing switch cases"" refactoring operation typically adds missing; cases to one switch at a time. However, it could be useful to have a; refactoring that works on all switches that operate on a particular enum, as; one could then automatically update all of them after adding a new enum; constant. To achieve that, we can create two different rules that will use one; ``clang-refactor`` subcommand. The first rule will describe a local operation; that's initiated when the user selects a single switch. The second rule will; describe a global operation that works across translation units and is initiated; when the user provides the name of the enum to clang-refactor (or the user could; select the enum declaration instead). The clang-refactor tool will then analyze; the selection and other options passed to the refactoring action, and will pick; the most appropriate rule for the given selection and other options. Rule Types; ^^^^^^^^^^. Clang's refactoring engine supports several different refactoring rules:. - ``SourceChangeRefactoringRule`` produces source replacements that are applied; to the source files.

By default, a histogram axis is drawn with its numeric bin labels. One; can specify alphanumeric labels instead. ### Option 1: SetBinLabel. To set an alphanumeric bin label call:. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis::SetBinLabel(bin,label);; ```. This can always be done before or after filling. Bin labels will be; automatically drawn with the histogram. ![Histograms with alphanumeric bin labels](pictures/0600003B.png). See example in `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/hist/hlabels1.C` , `hlabels2.C`. ### Option 2: Fill. You can also call a `Fill()` function with one of the arguments being; a string:. ``` {.cpp}; hist1->Fill(somename,weigth);; hist2->Fill(x,somename,weight);; hist2->Fill(somename,y,weight);; hist2->Fill(somenamex,somenamey,weight);; ```. ### Option 3: TTree::Draw. You can use a char\* variable type to histogram strings with; **`TTree`**`::Draw()`. ``` {.cpp}; // here ""Nation"" and ""Division"" are two char* branches of a Tree; tree.Draw(""Nation::Division"", """", ""text"");; ```. ![Using a \*char variable type in TTree::Draw](pictures/0200003C.png). There is an example in `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/cernstaff.C.`. If a variable is defined as `char*` it is drawn as a string by default.; You change that and draw the value of `char[0]` as an integer by; adding an arithmetic operation to the expression as shown below. ``` {.cpp}; // draw the integer value of MyChar[0] where ""MyChar"" is char[5]; tree.Draw(""MyChar + 0"");; ```. ### Sort Options. When using the options 2 or 3 above, the labels are automatically; added to the list (**`THashList`**) of labels for a given axis.

Orthogonal transforms can be successfully used for the; processing of nuclear spectra. They can be used to remove high; frequency noise, to increase signal-to-background ratio as well as to; enhance low intensity components [14]. We have implemented also the; function for the calculation of the commonly used orthogonal transforms:. - Haar; - Walsh; - Cos; - Sin; - Fourier; - Hartley. Between these transform one can define so called generalized mixed; transforms that are also implemented in the transform function:. - Fourier-Haar; - Fourier-Walsh; - Walsh-Haar; - Cos-Walsh; - Cos-Haar; - Sin-Walsh; - Sin-Haar. The suitability of the application of appropriate transform depends on; the character of the data, i.e., on the shape of dominant components; contained in the data. The form of the transform function is as follows:. ```{.cpp}; char *Transform1(const float *source,; float *dest,; int size,; int type,; int direction,; int degree);; ```.

Tests are identified by the test suite they are contained within, and the; relative path inside that suite.

Modifiability,"),; friendship means unrestricted access to the friends data. In this way it; is much like adding another branch to the tree without taking the risk; of damaging it. To add a friend to the list, you can use the; `TTree::AddFriend` method. The **`TTree`** (`tree`) below has two; friends (`ft1` and `ft2`) and now has access to the variables; `a,b,c,i,j,k,l` and `m`. ![](pictures/02000101.jpg). The `AddFriend` method has two parameters, the first is the tree name; and the second is the name of the ROOT file where the friend tree is; saved. `AddFriend` automatically opens the friend file. If no file name; is given, the tree called `ft1` is assumed to be in the same file as the; original tree. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""ft1"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. If the friend tree has the same name as the original tree, you can give; it an alias in the context of the friendship:. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""tree1 = tree"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. Once the tree has friends, we can use `TTree::Draw` as if the friend's; variables were in the original tree. To specify which tree to use in the; `Draw` method, use the syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; <treeName>.<branchname>.<varname>; ```. If the `variablename` is enough to identify uniquely the variable, you; can leave out the tree and/or branch name. For example, these commands generate a 3-d scatter plot of variable; ""`var`"" in the **`TTree`** `tree` versus variable `v1 in `TTree ft1`; versus variable `v2` in **`TTree`** `ft2`. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""ft1"",""friendfile1.root"");; tree.AddFriend(""ft2"",""friendfile2.root"");; tree.Draw(""var:ft1.v1:ft2.v2"");; ```. ![](pictures/02000102.jpg)The picture illustrates the access of the tree; and its friends with a `Draw` command.

Modifiability,"). Also, the ability to define new; variables is a useful thing regardless of whether you will be mutating; them. Here's a motivating example that shows how we could use these:. ::. # Define ':' for sequencing: as a low-precedence operator that ignores operands; # and just returns the RHS.; def binary : 1 (x y) y;. # Recursive fib, we could do this before.; def fib(x); if (x < 3) then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. # Iterative fib.; def fibi(x); var a = 1, b = 1, c in; (for i = 3, i < x in; c = a + b :; a = b :; b = c) :; b;. # Call it.; fibi(10);. In order to mutate variables, we have to change our existing variables; to use the ""alloca trick"". Once we have that, we'll add our new; operator, then extend Kaleidoscope to support new variable definitions. Adjusting Existing Variables for Mutation; =========================================. The symbol table in Kaleidoscope is managed at code generation time by; the '``NamedValues``' map. This map currently keeps track of the LLVM; ""Value\*"" that holds the double value for the named variable. In order; to support mutation, we need to change this slightly, so that; ``NamedValues`` holds the *memory location* of the variable in question.; Note that this change is a refactoring: it changes the structure of the; code, but does not (by itself) change the behavior of the compiler. All; of these changes are isolated in the Kaleidoscope code generator. At this point in Kaleidoscope's development, it only supports variables; for two things: incoming arguments to functions and the induction; variable of 'for' loops. For consistency, we'll allow mutation of these; variables in addition to other user-defined variables. This means that; these will both need memory locations. To start our transformation of Kaleidoscope, we'll change the; ``NamedValues`` map so that it maps to AllocaInst\* instead of Value\*. Once; we do this, the C++ compiler will tell us what parts of the code we need; to update:. .. code-block:: c++. static std::map",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:11759,variab,variable,11759,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"). Command line; options default to being optional, so if we would like to require that the user; always specify an input filename, we would add the `cl::Required`_ flag, and we; could eliminate the `cl::init`_ modifier, like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> InputFilename(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input file>""), cl::Required);. Again, the CommandLine library does not require the options to be specified in; any particular order, so the above declaration is equivalent to:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> InputFilename(cl::Positional, cl::Required, cl::desc(""<input file>""));. By simply adding the `cl::Required`_ flag, the CommandLine library will; automatically issue an error if the argument is not specified, which shifts all; of the command line option verification code out of your application into the; library. This is just one example of how using flags can alter the default; behaviour of the library, on a per-option basis. By adding one of the; declarations above, the ``-help`` option synopsis is now extended to:. ::. USAGE: compiler [options] <input file>. OPTIONS:; -h - Alias for -help; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); -o <filename> - Specify output filename. ... indicating that an input filename is expected. Boolean Arguments; -----------------. In addition to input and output filenames, we would like the compiler example to; support three boolean flags: ""``-f``"" to force writing binary output to a; terminal, ""``--quiet``"" to enable quiet mode, and ""``-q``"" for backwards; compatibility with some of our users. We can support these by declaring options; of boolean type like this:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<bool> Force (""f"", cl::desc(""Enable binary output on terminals""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet (""quiet"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet2(""q"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""), cl::Hidden);.

If you want your pass to be easily dumpable, you should implement the virtual; print method:. The ``print`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. .. code-block:: c++. virtual void print(llvm::raw_ostream &O, const Module *M) const;. The ``print`` method must be implemented by ""analyses"" in order to print a; human readable version of the analysis results. This is useful for debugging; an analysis itself, as well as for other people to figure out how an analysis; works. Use the opt ``-analyze`` argument to invoke this method. The ``llvm::raw_ostream`` parameter specifies the stream to write the results; on, and the ``Module`` parameter gives a pointer to the top level module of the; program that has been analyzed. Note however that this pointer may be ``NULL``; in certain circumstances (such as calling the ``Pass::dump()`` from a; debugger), so it should only be used to enhance debug output, it should not be; depended on. .. _writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction:. Specifying interactions between passes; --------------------------------------. One of the main responsibilities of the ``PassManager`` is to make sure that; passes interact with each other correctly. Because ``PassManager`` tries to; :ref:`optimize the execution of passes <writing-an-llvm-pass-passmanager>` it; must know how the passes interact with each other and what dependencies exist; between the various passes. To track this, each pass can declare the set of; passes that are required to be executed before the current pass, and the passes; which are invalidated by the current pass. Typically this functionality is used to require that analysis results are; computed before your pass is run. Running arbitrary transformation passes can; invalidate the computed analysis results, which is what the invalidation set; specifies.

References to variables are also quite simple using LLVM. In the simple; version of Kaleidoscope, we assume that the variable has already been; emitted somewhere and its value is available. In practice, the only; values that can be in the ``NamedValues`` map are function arguments.; This code simply checks to see that the specified name is in the map (if; not, an unknown variable is being referenced) and returns the value for; it. In future chapters, we'll add support for `loop induction; variables <LangImpl05.html#for-loop-expression>`_ in the symbol table, and for `local; variables <LangImpl07.html#user-defined-local-variables>`_. .. code-block:: c++.

The first and primary purpose of this document is to serve as a complete; technical specification of Automatic Reference Counting. Given a core; Objective-C compiler and runtime, it should be possible to write a compiler and; runtime which implements these new semantics. The secondary purpose is to act as a rationale for why ARC was designed in this; way. This should remain tightly focused on the technical design and should not; stray into marketing speculation. .. _arc.meta.background:. Background; ----------. This document assumes a basic familiarity with C. :arc-term:`Blocks` are a C language extension for creating anonymous functions.; Users interact with and transfer block objects using :arc-term:`block; pointers`, which are represented like a normal pointer. A block may capture; values from local variables; when this occurs, memory must be dynamically; allocated. The initial allocation is done on the stack, but the runtime; provides a ``Block_copy`` function which, given a block pointer, either copies; the underlying block object to the heap, setting its reference count to 1 and; returning the new block pointer, or (if the block object is already on the; heap) increases its reference count by 1. The paired function is; ``Block_release``, which decreases the reference count by 1 and destroys the; object if the count reaches zero and is on the heap. Objective-C is a set of language extensions, significant enough to be; considered a different language. It is a strict superset of C. The extensions; can also be imposed on C++, producing a language called Objective-C++. The; primary feature is a single-inheritance object system; we briefly describe the; modern dialect.

Here we have now all the required input ingredients for the fit, the data and the function to fit.; Depending on these we have now several different way to perform the fit, using the corresponding methods of the; `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class and depending on the type of input data. #### Available fit methods. * **Least-square fit**: `Fitter::LeastSquare(const BinData & )` or `Fitter::Fit(const Bindata &)`. It requires the user to pass a `BinData` object. It should be used when the data values follow a; Gaussian distribution. This fit method is implemented using the class `ROOT::Fit::Chi2FCN`.; * **Binned Likelihood fit** : `Fitter::LikelihoodFit(const Bindata & )`. The user needs to pass a `BinData` object. It should be used when the data values follow a Poisson or a multinomial; distribution. The Poisson case (extended fit) is the default and in this case the function normalization is also fit to the data. The Multi-nominal case can be selected by passing the optional; *extended* boolean flag as *false*. This method is implemented by the class `ROOT::Fit:::PoissonLikelihoodFCN`.; * **Un-Binned likelihood fit**: `Fitter::LikelihoodFit(const UnBindata &)`. The user needs to pass an `UnBinData` object. By default the fit is not extended (i.e. the normalization is not fitted to the; data). As above the user can select an extended likelihood fit by passing the optional; *extended* boolean flag as *true*. This method is implemented using the class `LogLikelihoodFCN`; * **Linear Fit**: A linear fit can be selected (no iterative minimization is needed in this case, but using linear algebra algorithms from the *Matrix* library), if the model function is linear in the; parameters. #### Customised Fit methods. Above we described the pre-defined methods used for fitting.

For example, this selection will add 1 to the histogram if x is less; than y and the square root of z is less than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""x<y && sqrt(z)>3.2""; ```. On the other hand, this selection will add `x+y` to the histogram if the; square root of z is larger than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""(x+y)*(sqrt(z)>3.2)""; ```. The `Draw` method has its own parser, and it only looks in the current; tree for variables. This means that any variable used in the selection; must be defined in the tree. You cannot use an arbitrary global variable; in the `TTree::Draw` method. ### Using TCut Objects in TTree::Draw. The `TTree::Draw` method also accepts **`TCutG`** objects. A; **`TCut`** is a specialized string object used for **`TTree`**; selections. A **`TCut`** object has a name and a title. It does not have; any data members in addition to what it inherits from **`TNamed`**. It; only adds a set of operators to do logical string concatenation. For; example, assume:. ``` {.cpp}; TCut cut1 = ""x<1""; TCut cut2 = ""y>2""; ```. then. ``` {.cpp}; cut1 && cut2; //result is the string ""(x<1)&&(y>2)""; ```. Operators =, +=, +, \*, !, &&, || are overloaded, here are some; examples:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCut c1 = ""x < 1""; root[] TCut c2 = ""y < 0""; root[] TCut c3 = c1 && c2; root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 || ""x>0""); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 && c2); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", ""(x + y)"" * (c1 && c2)); ```. ### Accessing the Histogram in Batch Mode.

The second contains a pointer to metadata that should be; associated with the pointer, and **must** be a constant or global value; address. If your target collector uses tags, use a null pointer for metadata. A compiler which performs manual SSA construction **must** ensure that SSA; values representing GC references are stored in to the alloca passed to the; respective ``gcroot`` before every call site and reloaded after every call.; A compiler which uses mem2reg to raise imperative code using ``alloca`` into; SSA form need only add a call to ``@llvm.gcroot`` for those variables which; are pointers into the GC heap. It is also important to mark intermediate values with ``llvm.gcroot``. For; example, consider ``h(f(), g())``. Beware leaking the result of ``f()`` in the; case that ``g()`` triggers a collection. Note, that stack variables must be; initialized and marked with ``llvm.gcroot`` in function's prologue.

Modifiability,"*** Once you have set a convenient global visualization option; and level, what you need is just call the `Draw()` method of your; interesting volume. You can do this either by interacting with the; expanded tree of volumes in a ROOT browser (where the context menu of; any volume is available), either by getting a pointer to it (e.g. by; name): `gGeoManager->GetVolume(""vol_name"")->Draw();`. ### Visualization Settings and Attributes. Supposing you now understand the basic things to do for drawing the; geometry or parts of it, you still might be not happy and wishing to; have more control on it. We will describe below how you can fine-tune some; settings. Since the corresponding attributes are flags belonging to; volume and node objects, you can change them at any time (even when the; picture is already drawn) and see immediately the result. #### Colors and Line Styles. We have already described how to change the line colors for volumes. In; fact, volume objects inherit from TAttLine class so the line style or; width can also be changed:. ``` {.cpp}; myVolume->SetLineColor(kRed);; myVolume->SetLineWith(2);; myVolume->SetLineStyle(kDotted);; ```. When drawing in solid mode, the color of the drawn volume corresponds to; the line color. #### Visibility Settings. The way geometry is build forces the definition of several volumes that; does not represent real objects, but just virtual containers used for; grouping and positioning volumes together. One would not want to see; them in the picture. Since every volume is by default visible, one has; to do this sort of tuning by its own:. ``` {.cpp}; myVolumeContainer->SetVisibility(kFALSE);; ```. As described before, the drawing package supports two main global; options: 1 (default) - only final volume leaves; 0 - all volumes down; the drawn one appear on the screen. The global visible level put a; limitation on the maximum applied depth. Combined with visibility; settings per volume, these can tune quite well what should appear",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:141627,inherit,inherit,141627,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['inherit'],['inherit']
Modifiability,"**pages** that contain all the data belonging to an entry range.; The data set is partitioned in clusters.; A typical cluster size is tens to hundreds of megabytes. ### Column. A column is a storage backed vector of a number of **elements** of a simple type.; Column elements have a fixed bit-length that depends on the column type.; Some column types allow setting the bit lengths within specific limits (e.g. for floats with truncated mantissa). ### Envelope. An envelope is a data block with RNTuple meta-data, such as the header and the footer. ### Field. A field describes a serialized C++ type.; A field can have a hierarchy of subfields representing a composed C++ type (e.g., a vector of integers).; A field has zero, one, or multiple **columns** attached to it.; The columns contain the data related to the field but not to its subfields, which have their own columns. ### Frame. A frame is a byte range with metadata information in an **envelope**.; A frame starts with its size and thus can be extended in a forward-compatible way. ### Locator. A locator is a generalized way to identify a byte range in the RNTuple container.; For a file container, for instance, a locator consists of an offset and a size. ### Page. A page is segment of a column.; Columns are partitioned in pages.; A page is a unit of compression.; Typical page sizes are of the order of tens to hundreds of kilobytes. ### Indications of size. In this document, the `length` of something (e.g., a page) refers to its size in bytes in memory, uncompressed.; The `size` of something refers to the size in bytes on disk, possibly compressed. ## Notes on Backward and Forward Compatibility.

If any of these is; missing or neglected, the External tests won't work. * *--with-externals*. * *--with-externals=<directory>*. This tells LLVM where to find any external tests. They are expected to; be in specifically named subdirectories of <``directory``>. If; ``directory`` is left unspecified, ``configure`` uses the default value; ``/home/vadve/shared/benchmarks/speccpu2000/benchspec``. Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst:2957,variab,variable,2957,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"*. Apple Clang Builds (A More Complex Bootstrap); =============================================. Apple's Clang builds are a slightly more complicated example of the simple; bootstrapping scenario. Apple Clang is built using a 2-stage build. The stage1 compiler is a host-only compiler with some options set. The stage1; compiler is a balance of optimization vs build time because it is a throwaway.; The stage2 compiler is the fully optimized compiler intended to ship to users. Setting up these compilers requires a lot of options. To simplify the; configuration the Apple Clang build settings are contained in CMake Cache files.; You can build an Apple Clang compiler using the following commands:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/Apple-stage1.cmake <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage2-distribution. This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst:4304,config,configuration,4304,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AdvancedBuilds.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']

The tool would simplify the code to:. ```c++; void Example() {; f();; g();; }; ```. We can solve this problem with a classic constant propagation lattice combined; with symbolic evaluation. ## Example: finding inefficient usages of associative containers. Real-world code often accidentally performs repeated lookups in associative; containers:. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; xs[42]->name = ""..."";; xs[42]->title = ""..."";; ```. To find the above inefficiency we can use the available expressions analysis to; understand that `m[42]` is evaluated twice. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; Employee &e = xs[42];; e->name = ""..."";; e->title = ""..."";; ```. We can also track the `m.contains()` check in the flow condition to find; redundant checks, like in the example below. ```c++; std::map<int, Employee> xs;; if (!xs.contains(42)) {; xs.insert({42, someEmployee});; }; ```. ## Example: refactoring types that implicitly convert to each other. Refactoring one strong type to another is difficult, but the compiler can help:; once you refactor one reference to the type, the compiler will flag other places; where this information flows with type mismatch errors. Unfortunately this; strategy does not work when you are refactoring types that implicitly convert to; each other, for example, replacing `int32_t` with `int64_t`. Imagine that we want to change user IDs from 32 to 64-bit integers. In other; words, we need to find all integers tainted with user IDs. We can use data flow; analysis to implement taint analysis. ```c++; void UseUser(int32_t user_id) {; int32_t id = user_id;; // Variable `id` is tainted with a user ID.; ...; }; ```. Taint analysis is very well suited to this problem because the program rarely; branches on user IDs, and almost certainly does not perform any computation; (like arithmetic).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:29452,refactor,refactoring,29452,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,3,['refactor'],"['refactor', 'refactoring']"

So we partition. At the point at which you partition, again,; experience has shown us there is no point in partitioning to more than; one variable. It simply generates more IR, and optimizations still; have to query something to disambiguate further anyway. As a result, LLVM partitions to one variable. Precision in practice; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In practice, there are implementation details in LLVM that also affect the; results' precision provided by ``MemorySSA``. For example, AliasAnalysis has various; caps, or restrictions on looking through phis which can affect what ``MemorySSA``; can infer.

The; estimated cluster size for the TTree and this factor is used to give the cache; size. If option is set to zero auto cache creation is disabled and the default; cache size is the historical one (equivalent to factor 1.0). If set to; non zero auto cache creation is enabled and both auto created and; default sized caches will use the configured factor: 0.0 no automatic cache; and greater than 0.0 to enable cache.

When the register allocator runs, debugging instructions do not directly refer; to any virtual registers, and thus there is no need for expensive location; maintenance during regalloc (i.e. `LiveDebugVariables`). Debug instructions are; unlinked from the function, then linked back in after register allocation; completes. The exception is `PHI` instructions: these become implicit definitions at; control flow merges once regalloc finishes, and any debug numbers attached to; `PHI` instructions are lost. To circumvent this, debug numbers of `PHI`s are; recorded at the start of register allocation (`phi-node-elimination`), then; `DBG_PHI` instructions are inserted after regalloc finishes. This requires some; maintenance of which register a variable is located in during regalloc, but at; single positions (block entry points) rather than ranges of instructions.

Both get compiled down to an 'i32' value and the; information about what it came from is lost. The more general issue; here, is that the LLVM type system uses ""structural equivalence"" instead; of ""name equivalence"". Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does.

Modifiability,", which CMake refers to using the following variable expansions:; CMAKE_${LANGUAGE}_FLAGS and CMAKE_${LANGUAGE}_FLAGS_${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}. Other Types; -----------. Variables that are cached or specified on the command line can have types; associated with them. The variable's type is used by CMake's UI tool to display; the right input field. A variable's type generally doesn't impact evaluation,; however CMake does have special handling for some variables such as PATH.; You can read more about the special handling in `CMake's set documentation; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/command/set.html#set-cache-entry>`_. Scope; -----. CMake inherently has a directory-based scoping. Setting a variable in a; CMakeLists file, will set the variable for that file, and all subdirectories.; Variables set in a CMake module that is included in a CMakeLists file will be; set in the scope they are included from, and all subdirectories. When a variable that is already set is set again in a subdirectory it overrides; the value in that scope and any deeper subdirectories. The CMake set command provides two scope-related options. PARENT_SCOPE sets a; variable into the parent scope, and not the current scope. The CACHE option sets; the variable in the CMakeCache, which results in it being set in all scopes. The; CACHE option will not set a variable that already exists in the CACHE unless the; FORCE option is specified. In addition to directory-based scope, CMake functions also have their own scope.; This means variables set inside functions do not bleed into the parent scope.; This is not true of macros, and it is for this reason LLVM prefers functions; over macros whenever reasonable. .. note::; Unlike C-based languages, CMake's loop and control flow blocks do not have; their own scopes.

If the script is not run in batch mode, it displays the; tree in the browser and tree viewer. To study the example scripts, you; can either execute the main script, or load the script and execute a; specific function. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; // execute the function that writes, reads, shows the tree; root[] x tree1.C; // use ACLiC to build shared library, check syntax, execute; root[] x tree1.C++; // Load the script and select a function to execute; root[] L tree1.C; root[] tree1w(); root[] tree1r(); ```. ## Example 1: A Tree with Simple Variables. This example shows how to write, view, and read a tree with several; simple (integers and floating-point) variables. ### Writing the Tree. Below is the function that writes the tree (`tree1w`). First, the; variables are defined (`px, py, pz,` `random` and `ev`). Then we add a; branch for each of the variables to the tree, by calling the; `TTree::Branch` method for each variable. ``` {.cpp}; void tree1w(){. // create a tree file tree1.root - create the file, the Tree and; // a few branches; TFile f(""tree1.root"",""recreate"");; TTree t1(""t1"",""a simple Tree with simple variables"");; Float_t px, py, pz;; Double_t random;; Int_t ev;; t1.Branch(""px"",&px,""px/F"");; t1.Branch(""py"",&py,""py/F"");; t1.Branch(""pz"",&pz,""pz/F"");; t1.Branch(""ev"",&ev,""ev/I"");. // fill the tree; for (Int_t i=0; i<10000; i++) {; gRandom->Rannor(px,py);; pz = px*px + py*py;; random = gRandom->Rndm();; ev = i;; t1.Fill();; }; // save the Tree heade; the file will be automatically closed; // when going out of the function scope; t1.Write();; }; ```. #### Creating Branches with A single Variable. This is the signature of `TTree::Branch` to create a branch with a list; of variables:. ``` {.cpp}; TBranch* TTree::Branch(const char* name,void* address,; const char* leaflist,; Int_t bufsize = 32000); ```.

Modifiability,", you; would need to add parentheses like this ``{{([[:xdigit:]]{8})}}`` to avoid; confusion with FileCheck's closing double-brace. FileCheck String Substitution Blocks; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. It is often useful to match a pattern and then verify that it occurs again; later in the file. For codegen tests, this can be useful to allow any; register, but verify that that register is used consistently later. To do; this, :program:`FileCheck` supports string substitution blocks that allow; string variables to be defined and substituted into patterns. Here is a simple; example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: test5:; ; CHECK: notw	[[REGISTER:%[a-z]+]]; ; CHECK: andw	{{.*}}[[REGISTER]]. The first check line matches a regex ``%[a-z]+`` and captures it into the; string variable ``REGISTER``. The second line verifies that whatever is in; ``REGISTER`` occurs later in the file after an ""``andw``"". :program:`FileCheck`; string substitution blocks are always contained in ``[[ ]]`` pairs, and string; variable names can be formed with the regex ``[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*``. If a; colon follows the name, then it is a definition of the variable; otherwise, it; is a substitution. :program:`FileCheck` variables can be defined multiple times, and substitutions; always get the latest value. Variables can also be substituted later on the; same line they were defined on. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: op [[REG:r[0-9]+]], [[REG]]. Can be useful if you want the operands of ``op`` to be the same register,; and don't care exactly which register it is. If ``--enable-var-scope`` is in effect, variables with names that; start with ``$`` are considered to be global. All others variables are; local. All local variables get undefined at the beginning of each; CHECK-LABEL block. Global variables are not affected by CHECK-LABEL.; This makes it easier to ensure that individual tests are not affected; by variables set in preceding tests.

The script opens the; ASCII file, creates a ROOT file and a **`TTree`**. Then it creates; branches with the `TTree::Branch` method. The first parameter of the; `Branch` method is the branch name. The second parameter is the address; from which the first leaf is to be read. Once the branches are defined, the script; reads the data from the ASCII file into C variables and; fills the `tree`. The ASCII file is closed, and the ROOT file is written; to disk saving the `tree`. Remember, trees (and histograms) are created in; the current directory, which is the file in our example. Hence a; `f->Write() `saves the tree. ## Show an Entry with TTree::Show. An easy way to access one entry of a tree is the use the `TTree::Show`; method. For example to look at the 10th entry in the `cernstaff.root` tree:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""cernstaff.root""); root[] T->Show(10); ======> EVENT:10; Category = 361; Flag = 15; Age = 51; Service = 29; Children = 0; Grade = 7; Step = 13; Hrweek = 40; Cost = 7599; Division = PS; Nation = FR; ```. ## Print the Tree Structure with TTree::Print.

You have the same flexibility to add, insert or remove entries. As with; list boxes you can retrieve the information for currently selected item; via `GetSelected` or `GetSelectedEntry` methods. The first one returns; the entry ID, the second - the current entry pointer; (**`TGLBEntry *`**). ### Sliders. A slider is a scale with an indicator (slider) that you can drag to; choose a value from a predefined range. It may be oriented horizontally; or vertically. In both cases it provides an excellent indication of; where a value exists within a range of values. ![](pictures/0200021B.jpg). The class **`TGHSlider`** represents the horizontal slider;; **`TGVSlider`** - the vertical one. Both inherit from the base class; **`TGSlider`** that creates the main slider parameters: the range of; values within a value can be selected; the indicator type; the tick mark; scale. Using its methods `SetRange`, `SetPosition` and `SetScale` you; can set these parameters. To retrieve the set slider value you can call; `GetPosition` method. Next sample code creates a horizontal slider `hslider` with a tick mark; of type `kSlider1`. Its width is 150 pixels, and its scale is placed; down (`kScaleDownRight`). The last parameter in the **`TGHSlider`**; constructor is the slider ID. It will be used for event processing. The; methods `SetRange` and `SetPosition` set the range and the current tick; mark position of the slider. ``` {.cpp}; hslider = new TGHSlider(parent,150,kSlider1|kScaleDownRight,sID);; hslider->SetRange(0,50);; hslider->SetPosition(39);; ```. Slider values can be set by using the mouse to drag the slider across; the scale until the desired value is reached. Another way is to click in; the slider trough instead of dragging. #### Double Slider.

This affects some early C++11 code, including Boost's popular shared_ptr; up to version 1.47.0. The fix for Boost's shared_ptr is; available here. Objective-C++ compatibility. Implicit downcasts. Due to a bug in its implementation, GCC allows implicit downcasts; of Objective-C pointers (from a base class to a derived class) when; calling functions. Such code is inherently unsafe, since the object; might not actually be an instance of the derived class, and is; rejected by Clang. For example, given this code:. @interface Base @end; @interface Derived : Base @end. void f(Derived *p);; void g(Base *p) {; f(p);; }. Clang produces the following error:. downcast.mm:6:3: error: no matching function for call to 'f'; f(p);; ^; downcast.mm:4:6: note: candidate function not viable: cannot convert from; superclass 'Base *' to subclass 'Derived *' for 1st argument; void f(Derived *p);; ^. If the downcast is actually correct (e.g., because the code has; already checked that the object has the appropriate type), add an; explicit cast:. f((Derived *)base);. Using class as a property name. In C and Objective-C, class is a normal identifier and; can be used to name fields, ivars, methods, and so on. In; C++, class is a keyword. For compatibility with existing; code, Clang permits class to be used as part of a method; selector in Objective-C++, but this does not extend to any other part; of the language. In particular, it is impossible to use property dot; syntax in Objective-C++ with the property name class, so; the following code will fail to parse:. @interface I {; int cls;; }; + (int)class;; @end. @implementation I; - (int) Meth { return I.class; }; @end.

Around 16000 bytes if; you have less than 100 branches and 4000 bytes if you have more than 500; branches. These numbers are recommended for computers with memory size; ranging from 32MB to 256MB. If you have more memory, you should specify; larger buffer sizes. However, in this case, do not forget that your file; might be used on another machine with a smaller memory configuration. #### Performance Considerations when Splitting a Branch. A split branch is faster to read, but slightly slower to write. The; reading is quicker because variables of the same type are stored; consecutively and the type does not have to be read each time. It is; slower to write because of the large number of buffers as described; above. See "". Performance Benchmarks"" for performance impact of split and non-split; mode. #### Rules for Splitting. When splitting a branch, variables of different types are handled; differently. Here are the rules that apply when splitting a branch. - If a data member is a basic type, it becomes one branch of class; **`TBranchElement`**. - A data member can be an array of basic types. In this case, one; single branch is created for the array. - A data member can be a pointer to an array of basic types. The; length can vary, and must be specified in the comment field of the; data member in the class definition. See ""Input/Output"". - Pointer data member are not split, except for pointers to a; **`TClonesArray`**. The **`TClonesArray`** (pointed to) is split if; the split level is greater than two. When the split level is one,; the **`TClonesArray`** is not split. - If a data member is a pointer to an object, a special branch is; created. The branch will be filled by calling the class `Streamer`; function to serialize the object into the branch buffer. - If a data member is an object, the data members of this object are; split into branche",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:26877,variab,variables,26877,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

The RooMCStudy class has been extended to accept the Constrain() argument as well in its constructor.; If specified it will do two things: 1) it will pass the constrain argument to the fitting pass of; the toy study and 2) it will modify the generation step into a two-step procedure: for each toy; in the study it will first sample a value of each constrained parameter from the joint constraints; p.d.f and it will then generate the observables for that experiment with the thus obtained parameter values.; In this mode of operation the parameter values for each toy may thus be different.

All global and static variables should be included,; including those scoped within functions and classes. For example using the; following code:. .. code-block:: c. static int var = 0;. void f (); {; static int var = 0;; }. Both of the static ``var`` variables would be included in the table.

Next example shows you how to change `kVerticalFrame` option to; `kHorizontalFrame`:. ``` {.cpp}; frame->ChangeOptions((frame->GetOptions()& ~kVerticalFrame) |; kHorizontalFrame);; ```. The class **`TGCompositeFrame`** is the base class of all composite; widgets as a menu bar, a list box, a combo box, etc. It subclasses; **`TGFrame`** and has in addition a layout manager and a list of child; frames/widgets. There are two steps to do the design using a composite; frame widget. First you put all widgets you need within this frame and; assign them desired properties using `AddFrame(),` then you lay them out; by the `Layout()` method according to the assigned layout manager. The; method `AddFrame()` creates an instance of **`TGFrameElement`** class; for every child widget of a composite frame. This class has three public; data members: the child pointer, its layout hints, and a status variable; showing if the child is visible or hidden. If no hints are specified,; the default layout hints are used. Because the layout is very important; part of any design we include a special section about layout management; and layout hints. You can set a layout manager for the composite frame via:. ``` {.cpp}; compFrame->SetLayoutManager(TGLayoutManager *l);; ```. The child widgets cannot be added to different composite frames. Any child frame can be removed from the parent list by:. ``` {.cpp}; compFrame->RemoveFrame(TGFrame *f);; ```. You can hide or show a child frame of a composite frame using the; methods: `HideFrame(TGFrame *f)` or `ShowFrame(TGFrame *f).` You should; call, for example `HideFrame(TGFrame *f),` only after the frames have; been laid out and the sub windows of the composite frame have been; mapped via method `MapSubwindows(),` i.e. ``` {.cpp}; frame->AddFrame(hFrame1,fLayout1);; frame->AddFrame(hFrame2,fLayout2);; frame->Resize(frame->GetDef",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md:29430,variab,variable,29430,documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/WritingGUI.md,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"------------------------------------------------------------------------. The number of registers and the cost of memory operations is much higher for; AMDGPU than a typical CPU. The compiler attempts to optimize whole variables and; arrays into registers. Currently DWARF only allows ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` and related operations; to work with a global memory location. To support AMDGPU optimized code it is; required to generalize DWARF to allow any location description to be used. This; allows registers, or composite location descriptions that may be a mixture of; memory, registers, or even implicit values. See ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-general-location-description-operations`. 2.8 General Support for Address Spaces; --------------------------------------. AMDGPU needs to be able to describe addresses that are in different kinds of; memory. Optimized code may need to describe a variable that resides in pieces; that are in different kinds of storage which may include parts of registers,; memory that is in a mixture of memory kinds, implicit values, or be undefined. DWARF has the concept of segment addresses. However, the segment cannot be; specified within a DWARF expression, which is only able to specify the offset; portion of a segment address. The segment index is only provided by the entity; that specifies the DWARF expression. Therefore, the segment index is a property; that can only be put on complete objects, such as a variable. That makes it only; suitable for describing an entity (such as variable or subprogram code) that is; in a single kind of memory. AMDGPU uses multiple address spaces. For example, a variable may be allocated in; a register that is partially spilled to the call stack which is in the private; address space, and partially spilled to the local address space. DWARF mentions; address spaces, for example as an argument to the ``DW_OP_xderef*`` operations.; A new section that defines address spaces is added (se",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:16983,variab,variable,16983,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

If the only purpose; of the loop is to compute the exit value of some derived expression, this; transformation will make the loop dead.

In each case, GCC will be invoked to compile the input. Assembler; ---------. Clang can either use LLVM's integrated assembler or an external system-specific; tool (for instance, the GNU Assembler on GNU OSes) to produce machine code from; assembly.; By default, Clang uses LLVM's integrated assembler on all targets where it is; supported. If you wish to use the system assembler instead, use the; ``-fno-integrated-as`` option. Linker; ------. Clang can be configured to use one of several different linkers:. * GNU ld; * GNU gold; * LLVM's `lld <https://lld.llvm.org>`_; * MSVC's link.exe. Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold. The default linker varies between targets, and can be overridden via the; ``-fuse-ld=<linker name>`` flag. Runtime libraries; =================. A number of different runtime libraries are required to provide different; layers of support for C family programs. Clang will implicitly link an; appropriate implementation of each runtime library, selected based on; target defaults or explicitly selected by the ``--rtlib=`` and ``--stdlib=``; flags. The set of implicitly-linked libraries depend on the language mode. As a; consequence, you should use ``clang++`` when linking C++ programs in order; to ensure the C++ runtimes are provided. .. note::.

Modifiability,"----------------------------===//. Mar 25, 2009 - Initial Revision. Most ABIs specify that functions which return small integers do so in a; specific integer GPR. This is an efficient way to go, but raises the question:; if the returned value is smaller than the register, what do the high bits hold?. There are three (interesting) possible answers: undefined, zero extended, or; sign extended. The number of bits in question depends on the data-type that; the front-end is referencing (typically i1/i8/i16/i32). Knowing the answer to this is important for two reasons: 1) we want to be able; to implement the ABI correctly. If we need to sign extend the result according; to the ABI, we really really do need to do this to preserve correctness. 2); this information is often useful for optimization purposes, and we want the; mid-level optimizers to be able to process this (e.g. eliminate redundant; extensions). For example, lets pretend that X86 requires the caller to properly extend the; result of a return (I'm not sure this is the case, but the argument doesn't; depend on this). Given this, we should compile this:. int a();; short b() { return a(); }. into:. _b:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	L_a$stub; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	cwtl; 	ret. An optimization example is that we should be able to eliminate the explicit; sign extension in this example:. short y();; int z() {; return ((int)y() << 16) >> 16;; }. _z:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	_y; 	;; movswl %ax, %eax -> not needed because eax is already sext'd; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	ret. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // What we have right now.; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//.

Instruction selection creates a MIR function from an IR function, and just as; it transforms ``intermediate`` instructions into machine instructions, so must; ``intermediate`` variable locations become machine variable locations.; Within IR, variable locations are always identified by a Value, but in MIR; there can be different types of variable locations. In addition, some IR; locations become unavailable, for example if the operation of multiple IR; instructions are combined into one machine instruction (such as; multiply-and-accumulate) then intermediate Values are lost. To track variable; locations through instruction selection, they are first separated into; locations that do not depend on code generation (constants, stack locations,; allocated virtual registers) and those that do. For those that do, debug; metadata is attached to SDNodes in SelectionDAGs. After instruction selection; has occurred and a MIR function is created, if the SDNode associated with debug; metadata is allocated a virtual register, that virtual register is used as the; variable location. If the SDNode is folded into a machine instruction or; otherwise transformed into a non-register, the variable location becomes; unavailable. Locations that are unavailable are treated as if they have been optimized out:; in IR the location would be assigned ``undef`` by a debug intrinsic, and in MIR; the equivalent location is used. After MIR locations are assigned to each variable, machine pseudo-instructions; corresponding to each ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic are inserted. There are two; forms of this type of instruction.

Modifiability,"------------------. Quick answer: there are no superfluous indices. This question arises most often when the GEP instruction is applied to a global; variable which is always a pointer type. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. %MyStruct = external global { ptr, i32 }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { ptr, i32 }, ptr %MyStruct, i64 0, i32 1. The GEP above yields a ``ptr`` by indexing the ``i32`` typed field of the; structure ``%MyStruct``. When people first look at it, they wonder why the ``i64; 0`` index is needed. However, a closer inspection of how globals and GEPs work; reveals the need. Becoming aware of the following facts will dispel the; confusion:. #. The type of ``%MyStruct`` is *not* ``{ ptr, i32 }`` but rather ``ptr``.; That is, ``%MyStruct`` is a pointer (to a structure), not a structure itself. #. Point #1 is evidenced by noticing the type of the second operand of the GEP; instruction (``%MyStruct``) which is ``ptr``. #. The first index, ``i64 0`` is required to step over the global variable; ``%MyStruct``. Since the second argument to the GEP instruction must always; be a value of pointer type, the first index steps through that pointer. A; value of 0 means 0 elements offset from that pointer. #. The second index, ``i32 1`` selects the second field of the structure (the; ``i32``). What is dereferenced by GEP?; ----------------------------. Quick answer: nothing. The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't access; memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for. GEP is; only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer.

Modifiability,"----------------. A ``defvar`` statement defines a global variable. Its value can be used; throughout the statements that follow the definition. .. productionlist::; Defvar: ""defvar"" `TokIdentifier` ""="" `Value` "";"". The identifier on the left of the ``=`` is defined to be a global variable; whose value is given by the value expression on the right of the ``=``. The; type of the variable is automatically inferred. Once a variable has been defined, it cannot be set to another value. Variables defined in a top-level ``foreach`` go out of scope at the end of; each loop iteration, so their value in one iteration is not available in; the next iteration. The following ``defvar`` will not work::. defvar i = !add(i, 1);. Variables can also be defined with ``defvar`` in a record body. See; `Defvar in a Record Body`_ for more details. ``foreach`` --- iterate over a sequence of statements; -----------------------------------------------------. The ``foreach`` statement iterates over a series of statements, varying a; variable over a sequence of values. .. productionlist::; Foreach: ""foreach"" `ForeachIterator` ""in"" ""{"" `Statement`* ""}""; :| ""foreach"" `ForeachIterator` ""in"" `Statement`; ForeachIterator: `TokIdentifier` ""="" (""{"" `RangeList` ""}"" | `RangePiece` | `Value`). The body of the ``foreach`` is a series of statements in braces or a; single statement with no braces. The statements are re-evaluated once for; each value in the range list, range piece, or single value. On each; iteration, the :token:`TokIdentifier` variable is set to the value and can; be used in the statements. The statement list establishes an inner scope. Variables local to a; ``foreach`` go out of scope at the end of each loop iteration, so their; values do not carry over from one iteration to the next. Foreach loops may; be nested. .. Note that the productions involving RangeList and RangePiece have precedence; over the more generic value parsing based on the first token. .. code-block:: text. foreach i = [0",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst:45771,variab,variable,45771,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

When the flag ImplicitCode is true then it means that the Instruction has been; added by the front-end but doesn't correspond to source code written by the user. For example. .. code-block:: c++. if (MyBoolean) {; MyObject MO;; ...; }. At the end of the scope the MyObject's destructor is called but it isn't written; explicitly.

Modifiability,"---------. Functions and Macros look very similar in how they are used, but there is one; fundamental difference between the two. Functions have their own scope, and; macros don't. This means variables set in macros will bleed out into the calling; scope. That makes macros suitable for defining very small bits of functionality; only. The other difference between CMake functions and macros is how arguments are; passed. Arguments to macros are not set as variables, instead dereferences to; the parameters are resolved across the macro before executing it. This can; result in some unexpected behavior if using unreferenced variables. For example:. .. code-block:: cmake. macro(print_list my_list); foreach(var IN LISTS my_list); message(""${var}""); endforeach(); endmacro(). set(my_list a b c d); set(my_list_of_numbers 1 2 3 4); print_list(my_list_of_numbers); # prints:; # a; # b; # c; # d. Generally speaking this issue is uncommon because it requires using; non-dereferenced variables with names that overlap in the parent scope, but it; is important to be aware of because it can lead to subtle bugs. LLVM Project Wrappers; =====================. LLVM projects provide lots of wrappers around critical CMake built-in commands.; We use these wrappers to provide consistent behaviors across LLVM components; and to reduce code duplication. We generally (but not always) follow the convention that commands prefaced with; ``llvm_`` are intended to be used only as building blocks for other commands.; Wrapper commands that are intended for direct use are generally named following; with the project in the middle of the command name (i.e. ``add_llvm_executable``; is the wrapper for ``add_executable``). The LLVM ``add_*`` wrapper functions are; all defined in ``AddLLVM.cmake`` which is installed as part of the LLVM; distribution. It can be included and used by any LLVM sub-project that requires; LLVM. .. note::. Not all LLVM projects require LLVM for all use cases.

Modifiability,"---------. Sometimes, when writing new passes, or trying to track down bugs, it; is useful to be able to control whether certain things in your pass; happen or not. For example, there are times the minimization tooling; can only easily give you large testcases. You would like to narrow; your bug down to a specific transformation happening or not happening,; automatically, using bisection. This is where debug counters help.; They provide a framework for making parts of your code only execute a; certain number of times. The ``llvm/Support/DebugCounter.h`` (`doxygen; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/DebugCounter_8h_source.html>`__) file; provides a class named ``DebugCounter`` that can be used to create; command line counter options that control execution of parts of your code. Define your DebugCounter like this:. .. code-block:: c++. DEBUG_COUNTER(DeleteAnInstruction, ""passname-delete-instruction"",; 		""Controls which instructions get delete"");. The ``DEBUG_COUNTER`` macro defines a static variable, whose name; is specified by the first argument. The name of the counter; (which is used on the command line) is specified by the second; argument, and the description used in the help is specified by the; third argument. Whatever code you want that control, use ``DebugCounter::shouldExecute`` to control it. .. code-block:: c++. if (DebugCounter::shouldExecute(DeleteAnInstruction)); I->eraseFromParent();. That's all you have to do. Now, using opt, you can control when this code triggers using; the '``--debug-counter``' option. There are two counters provided, ``skip`` and ``count``.; ``skip`` is the number of times to skip execution of the codepath. ``count`` is the number; of times, once we are done skipping, to execute the codepath. .. code-block:: none. $ opt --debug-counter=passname-delete-instruction-skip=1,passname-delete-instruction-count=2 -passname.

Modifiability,"--------. Clang supports ARC-style weak and unsafe references in Objective-C even; outside of ARC mode. Weak references must be explicitly enabled with; the ``-fobjc-weak`` option; use ``__has_feature((objc_arc_weak))``; to test whether they are enabled. Unsafe references are enabled; unconditionally. ARC-style weak and unsafe references cannot be used; when Objective-C garbage collection is enabled. Except as noted below, the language rules for the ``__weak`` and; ``__unsafe_unretained`` qualifiers (and the ``weak`` and; ``unsafe_unretained`` property attributes) are just as laid out; in the :doc:`ARC specification <AutomaticReferenceCounting>`.; In particular, note that some classes do not support forming weak; references to their instances, and note that special care must be; taken when storing weak references in memory where initialization; and deinitialization are outside the responsibility of the compiler; (such as in ``malloc``-ed memory). Loading from a ``__weak`` variable always implicitly retains the; loaded value. In non-ARC modes, this retain is normally balanced; by an implicit autorelease. This autorelease can be suppressed; by performing the load in the receiver position of a ``-retain``; message send (e.g. ``[weakReference retain]``); note that this performs; only a single retain (the retain done when primitively loading from; the weak reference). For the most part, ``__unsafe_unretained`` in non-ARC modes is just the; default behavior of variables and therefore is not needed. However,; it does have an effect on the semantics of block captures: normally,; copying a block which captures an Objective-C object or block pointer; causes the captured pointer to be retained or copied, respectively,; but that behavior is suppressed when the captured variable is qualified; with ``__unsafe_unretained``.

If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features.

Modifiability,"-----. TableGen source files contain two primary items: *abstract records* and; *concrete records*. In this and other TableGen documents, abstract records; are called *classes.* (These classes are different from C++ classes and do; not map onto them.) In addition, concrete records are usually just called; records, although sometimes the term *record* refers to both classes and; concrete records. The distinction should be clear in context. Classes and concrete records have a unique *name*, either chosen by; the programmer or generated by TableGen. Associated with that name; is a list of *fields* with values and an optional list of *parent classes*; (sometimes called base or super classes). The fields are the primary data that; backends will process. Note that TableGen assigns no meanings to fields; the; meanings are entirely up to the backends and the programs that incorporate; the output of those backends. .. note::. The term ""parent class"" can refer to a class that is a parent of another; class, and also to a class from which a concrete record inherits. This; nonstandard use of the term arises because TableGen treats classes and; concrete records similarly. A backend processes some subset of the concrete records built by the; TableGen parser and emits the output files. These files are usually C++; ``.inc`` files that are included by the programs that require the data in; those records. However, a backend can produce any type of output files. For; example, it could produce a data file containing messages tagged with; identifiers and substitution parameters. In a complex use case such as the; LLVM code generator, there can be many concrete records and some of them can; have an unexpectedly large number of fields, resulting in large output files.

Parameter attributes are considered to be part; of the function, not of the function type, so functions with different; parameter attributes can have the same function type. Parameter attributes are simple keywords that follow the type specified.; If multiple parameter attributes are needed, they are space separated.; For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. declare i32 @printf(ptr noalias nocapture, ...); declare i32 @atoi(i8 zeroext); declare signext i8 @returns_signed_char(). Note that any attributes for the function result (``nonnull``,; ``signext``) come before the result type. Currently, only the following parameter attributes are defined:. ``zeroext``; This indicates to the code generator that the parameter or return; value should be zero-extended to the extent required by the target's; ABI by the caller (for a parameter) or the callee (for a return value).; ``signext``; This indicates to the code generator that the parameter or return; value should be sign-extended to the extent required by the target's; ABI (which is usually 32-bits) by the caller (for a parameter) or; the callee (for a return value).; ``inreg``; This indicates that this parameter or return value should be treated; in a special target-dependent fashion while emitting code for; a function call or return (usually, by putting it in a register as; opposed to memory, though some targets use it to distinguish between; two different kinds of registers). Use of this attribute is; target-specific.; ``byval(<ty>)``; This indicates that the pointer parameter should really be passed by; value to the function. The attribute implies that a hidden copy of; the pointee is made between the caller and the callee, so the callee; is unable to modify the value in the caller.

Pick the first in this section that will do what you want. .. _dss_arrayref:. llvm/ADT/ArrayRef.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``llvm::ArrayRef`` class is the preferred class to use in an interface that; accepts a sequential list of elements in memory and just reads from them. By; taking an ``ArrayRef``, the API can be passed a fixed size array, an; ``std::vector``, an ``llvm::SmallVector`` and anything else that is contiguous; in memory. .. _dss_fixedarrays:. Fixed Size Arrays; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Fixed size arrays are very simple and very fast. They are good if you know; exactly how many elements you have, or you have a (low) upper bound on how many; you have. .. _dss_heaparrays:. Heap Allocated Arrays; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Heap allocated arrays (``new[]`` + ``delete[]``) are also simple. They are good; if the number of elements is variable, if you know how many elements you will; need before the array is allocated, and if the array is usually large (if not,; consider a :ref:`SmallVector <dss_smallvector>`). The cost of a heap allocated; array is the cost of the new/delete (aka malloc/free). Also note that if you; are allocating an array of a type with a constructor, the constructor and; destructors will be run for every element in the array (re-sizable vectors only; construct those elements actually used). .. _dss_tinyptrvector:. llvm/ADT/TinyPtrVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``TinyPtrVector<Type>`` is a highly specialized collection class that is; optimized to avoid allocation in the case when a vector has zero or one; elements. It has two major restrictions: 1) it can only hold values of pointer; type, and 2) it cannot hold a null pointer.

Modifiability,"-Goals; ---------. ``MemorySSA`` is meant to reason about the relation between memory; operations, and enable quicker querying.; It isn't meant to be the single source of truth for all potential memory-related; optimizations. Specifically, care must be taken when trying to use ``MemorySSA``; to reason about atomic or volatile operations, as in:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 @foo(ptr %a) {; entry:; br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.end. if.then:; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); %0 = load volatile i8, ptr %a; br label %if.end. if.end:; %av = phi i8 [0, %entry], [%0, %if.then]; ret i8 %av; }. Going solely by ``MemorySSA``'s analysis, hoisting the ``load`` to ``entry`` may; seem legal. Because it's a volatile load, though, it's not. Design tradeoffs; ----------------. Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory). First, because alias analysis results conflict with each other, and; each result may be what an analysis wants (IE; TBAA may say no-alias, and something else may say must-alias), it is; not possible to partition the memory the way every optimization wants.; Second, some alias analysis results are not transitive (IE A noalias B,; and B noalias C, does not mean A noalias C), so it is not possible to; come up with a precise partitioning in all cases without variables to; represent every pair of possible aliases. Thus, partitioning; precisely may require introducing at least N^2 new virtual variables,; phi nodes, etc. Each of these variables may be clobbered at multiple def sites. To give an example, if you were to split up struct fields into; individual variables, all aliasing operations that may-def multiple struct; fields, will may-def more than one of them",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:16718,variab,variables,16718,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,3,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

LLVM debugging information has been carefully designed to make it possible for; the optimizer to optimize the program and debugging information without; necessarily having to know anything about debugging information. In; particular, the use of metadata avoids duplicated debugging information from; the beginning, and the global dead code elimination pass automatically deletes; debugging information for a function if it decides to delete the function. To do this, most of the debugging information (descriptors for types,; variables, functions, source files, etc) is inserted by the language front-end; in the form of LLVM metadata. Debug information is designed to be agnostic about the target debugger and; debugging information representation (e.g. DWARF/Stabs/etc). It uses a generic; pass to decode the information that represents variables, types, functions,; namespaces, etc: this allows for arbitrary source-language semantics and; type-systems to be used, as long as there is a module written for the target; debugger to interpret the information. To provide basic functionality, the LLVM debugger does have to make some; assumptions about the source-level language being debugged, though it keeps; these to a minimum. The only common features that the LLVM debugger assumes; exist are `source files <LangRef.html#difile>`_, and `program objects; <LangRef.html#diglobalvariable>`_. These abstract objects are used by a; debugger to form stack traces, show information about local variables, etc. This section of the documentation fir",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:6827,variab,variables,6827,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"-exporting symbols from several other JITDylibs. .. _Laziness:. Laziness; ========. Laziness in ORC is provided by a utility called ""lazy reexports"". A lazy; reexport is similar to a regular reexport or alias: It provides a new name for; an existing symbol. Unlike regular reexports however, lookups of lazy reexports; do not trigger immediate materialization of the reexported symbol. Instead, they; only trigger materialization of a function stub. This function stub is; initialized to point at a *lazy call-through*, which provides reentry into the; JIT. If the stub is called at runtime then the lazy call-through will look up; the reexported symbol (triggering materialization for it if necessary), update; the stub (to call directly to the reexported symbol on subsequent calls), and; then return via the reexported symbol. By re-using the existing symbol lookup; mechanism, lazy reexports inherit the same concurrency guarantees: calls to lazy; reexports can be made from multiple threads concurrently, and the reexported; symbol can be any state of compilation (uncompiled, already in the process of; being compiled, or already compiled) and the call will succeed. This allows; laziness to be safely mixed with features like remote compilation, concurrent; compilation, concurrent JIT'd code, and speculative compilation. There is one other key difference between regular reexports and lazy reexports; that some clients must be aware of: The address of a lazy reexport will be; *different* from the address of the reexported symbol (whereas a regular; reexport is guaranteed to have the same address as the reexported symbol).; Clients who care about pointer equality will generally want to use the address; of the reexport as the canonical address of the reexported symbol. This will; allow the address to be taken without forcing materialization of the reexport. Usage example:.

This step uses traditional prepass; scheduling techniques. After all of these steps are complete, the SelectionDAG is destroyed and the; rest of the code generation passes are run. One of the most common ways to debug these steps is using ``-debug-only=isel``,; which prints out the DAG, along with other information like debug info,; after each of these steps. Alternatively, ``-debug-only=isel-dump`` shows only; the DAG dumps, but the results can be filtered by function names using; ``-filter-print-funcs=<function names>``. One great way to visualize what is going on here is to take advantage of a few; LLC command line options. The following options pop up a window displaying the; SelectionDAG at specific times (if you only get errors printed to the console; while using this, you probably `need to configure your; system <ProgrammersManual.html#viewing-graphs-while-debugging-code>`_ to add support for it). * ``-view-dag-combine1-dags`` displays the DAG after being built, before the; first optimization pass. * ``-view-legalize-dags`` displays the DAG before Legalization. * ``-view-dag-combine2-dags`` displays the DAG before the second optimization; pass. * ``-view-isel-dags`` displays the DAG before the Select phase. * ``-view-sched-dags`` displays the DAG before Scheduling.

Modifiability,"-inlining; ------------. This option controls which C++ member functions may be inlined. ``-analyzer-config c++-inlining=[none | methods | constructors | destructors]``. Each of these modes implies that all the previous member function kinds will be; inlined as well; it doesn't make sense to inline destructors without inlining; constructors, for example. The default c++-inlining mode is 'destructors', meaning that all member; functions with visible definitions will be considered for inlining. In some; cases the analyzer may still choose not to inline the function. Note that under 'constructors', constructors for types with non-trivial; destructors will not be inlined. Additionally, no C++ member functions will be; inlined under -analyzer-config ipa=none or -analyzer-config ipa=basic-inlining,; regardless of the setting of the c++-inlining mode. c++-template-inlining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This option controls whether C++ templated functions may be inlined. ``-analyzer-config c++-template-inlining=[true | false]``. Currently, template functions are considered for inlining by default. The motivation behind this option is that very generic code can be a source; of false positives, either by considering paths that the caller considers; impossible (by some unstated precondition), or by inlining some but not all; of a deep implementation of a function. c++-stdlib-inlining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This option controls whether functions from the C++ standard library, including; methods of the container classes in the Standard Template Library, should be; considered for inlining. ``-analyzer-config c++-stdlib-inlining=[true | false]``. Currently, C++ standard library functions are considered for inlining by; default.

SparseMultiSet adds multiset behavior to SparseSet, while retaining SparseSet's; desirable attributes. Like SparseSet, it typically uses a lot of memory, but; provides operations that are almost as fast as a vector. Typical keys are; physical registers, virtual registers, or numbered basic blocks. SparseMultiSet is useful for algorithms that need very fast; clear/find/insert/erase of the entire collection, and iteration over sets of; elements sharing a key. It is often a more efficient choice than using composite; data structures (e.g. vector-of-vectors, map-of-vectors). It is not intended for; building composite data structures. .. _dss_FoldingSet:. llvm/ADT/FoldingSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. FoldingSet is an aggregate class that is really good at uniquing; expensive-to-create or polymorphic objects. It is a combination of a chained; hash table with intrusive links (uniqued objects are required to inherit from; FoldingSetNode) that uses :ref:`SmallVector <dss_smallvector>` as part of its ID; process. Consider a case where you want to implement a ""getOrCreateFoo"" method for a; complex object (for example, a node in the code generator). The client has a; description of **what** it wants to generate (it knows the opcode and all the; operands), but we don't want to 'new' a node, then try inserting it into a set; only to find out it already exists, at which point we would have to delete it; and return the node that already exists. To support this style of client, FoldingSet perform a query with a; FoldingSetNodeID (which wraps SmallVector) that can be used to describe the; element that we want to query for. The query either returns the element; matching the ID or it returns an opaque ID that indicates where insertion should; take place. Construction of the ID usually does not require heap traffic. Because FoldingSet uses intrusive links, it can support polymorphic objects in; the set (",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:81947,inherit,inherit,81947,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['inherit'],['inherit']

This example is a simplified version of `$ROOTSYS/test/MainEvent.cxx`; and where Event objects are saved in a tree. The full definition of; `Event` is in `$ROOTSYS/test`/`Event.h`. To execute this macro, you will; need the library `$ROOTSYS/test/libEvent.so`. If it does not exist you; can build the test directory applications by following the instruction; in the `$ROOTSYS/test/README` file. In this example we will show. - the difference in splitting or not splitting a branch; - how to read selected branches of the tree,; - how to print a selected entry. ### The Event Class. `Event` is a descendent of **`TObject`**. As such it inherits the data; members of **`TObject`** and its methods such as `Dump()` and; `Inspect() `and` Write()`. In addition, because it inherits from; **`TObject`** it can be a member of a collection. To summarize, the; advantages of inheriting from a **`TObject`** are:. - Inherit the `Write`, `Inspect`, and `Dump` methods; - Enables a class to be a member of a ROOT collection; - Enables RTTI. Below is the list of the `Event` data members. It contains a character; array, several integers, a floating-point number, and an `EventHeader`; object. The `EventHeader` class is described in the following paragraph.; `Event` also has two pointers, one to a **`TClonesArray`** of tracks and; one to a histogram. The string ""`->`"" in the comment field of the; members `*fTracks` and `*fH` instructs the automatic `Streamer` to; assume that the objects `*fTracks` and `*fH` are never null pointers and; that `fTracks->Streamer` can be used instead of the more time consuming; form `R__b << fTracks`. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; EventHeader fEvtHdr;; TClonesArray *fTracks; //->; TH1F *fH; //->; Int_t fMeasures[10",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:58861,inherit,inheriting,58861,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['inherit'],['inheriting']

But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during build time, not configure time. Also, finding the libraries for your target are not as easy; as for your host machine. There aren't many cross-libraries available; as packages to most OS's, so you'll have to either cross-compile them; from source, or download the package for your target platform,; extract the libraries and headers, put them in specific directories; and add ``-I`` and ``-L`` pointing to them. Also, some libraries have different dependencies on different targets,; so configuration tools to find dependencies in the host can get the; list wrong for the target platform. This means that the configuration; of your build can get things wrong when setting their own library; paths, and you'll have to augment it via additional flags (configure,; Make, CMake, etc). Multilibs; ---------. When you want to cross-compile to more than one configuration, for; example hard-float-ARM and soft-float-ARM, you'll have to have multiple; copies of your libraries and (possibly) headers.

Atomic instructions (:ref:`cmpxchg <i_cmpxchg>`,; :ref:`atomicrmw <i_atomicrmw>`, :ref:`fence <i_fence>`,; :ref:`atomic load <i_load>`, and :ref:`atomic store <i_store>`) take; ordering parameters that determine which other atomic instructions on; the same address they *synchronize with*. These semantics implement; the Java or C++ memory models; if these descriptions aren't precise; enough, check those specs (see spec references in the; :doc:`atomics guide <Atomics>`). :ref:`fence <i_fence>` instructions; treat these orderings somewhat differently since they don't take an; address. See that instruction's documentation for details. For a simpler introduction to the ordering constraints, see the; :doc:`Atomics`. ``unordered``; The set of values that can be read is governed by the happens-before; partial order. A value cannot be read unless some operation wrote; it. This is intended to provide a guarantee strong enough to model; Java's non-volatile shared variables. This ordering cannot be; specified for read-modify-write operations; it is not strong enough; to make them atomic in any interesting way.; ``monotonic``; In addition to the guarantees of ``unordered``, there is a single; total order for modifications by ``monotonic`` operations on each; address. All modification orders must be compatible with the; happens-before order. There is no guarantee that the modification; orders can be combined to a global total order for the whole program; (and this often will not be possible). The read in an atomic; read-modify-write operation (:ref:`cmpxchg <i_cmpxchg>` and; :ref:`atomicrmw <i_atomicrmw>`) reads the value in the modification; order immediately before the value it writes. If one atomic read; happens before another atomic read of the same address, the later; read must see the same value or a later value in the address's; modification order.

We will now always use; the --enable-explicitlink ./configure option which will cause a shared lib; or executable to be linked with all its dependent libraries. The OSX linker; is quite good and processing this extended set of libraries for each link; does cost only 3s extra time for all 100+ shared libs (13s instead of 10s).; Not much for the extra security. In addition we went back to the default; linker option ""-undefined error"", so you will get an error if symbols; are unresolved. Shared libs are also linked with the option; ""-Wl,-dead_strip_dylibs"" which tells the linker to remove any shared lib; which is not used to resolve any symbols (this should; solve the long standing issue of ACliC linking all previously created; shared libs even when not needed). Linux. Make --enable-explictlink the default on linux too (was already the case for:; macosx, freebsd, openbsd, aix and win32). This adds some extra time to; the link stage, which can be recuperated by using the newer, much faster,; gold linker. In addition we added the linker option ""-Wl,--no-undefined"",; so you will get an error if symbols are unresolved.; Explicit linking is required by newer distributions, like Ubuntu 11.10,; that require all dependent shared libs to be specified when linking.

Both a GCC-compatible compiler driver (clang) and an; MSVC-compatible compiler driver (clang-cl.exe) are provided. You; can get and build the source today. Features and Goals. Some of the goals for the project include the following:; End-User Features:. Fast compiles and low memory use; Expressive diagnostics (examples); GCC & MSVC compatibility. Utility and; Applications:. Modular library based architecture; Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code generation,; etc.); Allow tight integration with IDEs; Use the LLVM 'Apache 2'; License. Internal Design and; Implementation:. A real-world, production quality compiler; A simple and hackable code base; A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++; Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants. Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of; Clang. To get a true sense of what it is all about, see the Features section, which breaks; each of these down and explains them in more detail. Why?. Development of the new front-end was started out of a need; for a compiler that allows better diagnostics, better integration with; IDEs, a license that is compatible with commercial products, and a; nimble compiler that is easy to develop and maintain. All of these were; motivations for starting work on a new front-end that could; meet these needs. Current Status.

Clang has support of C, objC, objC++ and we are looking forward to having more use-cases and extend our tool in that direction.; Cling has internal commands, which can change its behavior at runtime. Those commands usually start with dot (.):; .I <path> - Adds an include path;; .x <filename> - #include-s the filename; and calls function called filename(); ; .L <libname> - Loads libname or #include-s the libname if libname is file;; .@ - Cancels the multiline input;; .printAST - (DEBUG ONLY) Turns on the printing of the compiler's abstract syntax tree (AST);; .dynamicExtensions - Turns on cling's dynamic extensions. This in turn enables the dynamic lookup and the late resolving of the identifier. With that option cling tries to heal the compile-time failed lookups at runtime;. Details; Command line.

Modifiability,". Core. The ROOT source directory has been drastically reorganized and simplified.; Each source directory containing the code for a single library or plugin,; were all in the same top level directory, without logical grouping.; This made it difficult to see which libraries were related and belonged; together. In the new structure we've added a set of meta directories; that are used to group the sources of related libraries, and that also; reflects the ROOT team work package structure.; Note, the name and number of libraries has not been changed.; This new structure also facilitates the maintaining of the release notes; and other documentation items per meta package. On Linux, MacOS X and Windows, there is no need anymore to define the; environment variable ROOTSYS. Internally ROOTSYS is set depending on the; location of the ROOT libraries. ROOTSYS was never needed when ROOT was; configured using --prefix. On MacOS X when configure'ing with --enable-rpath (and not specifying; --prefix) the installation does not need (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set; anymore. The installation is completely relocatable. The (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH; is determined relative to the location of the root executable.

See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines. Different tools have; different ways of loading dynamic pass plugins. For example, ``opt; -load-pass-plugin=path/to/plugin.so`` loads a pass plugin into ``opt``. For; information on writing a pass plugin, see :doc:`WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass`. Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached. The analysis manager only provides analysis results for the same IR type as; what the pass runs on. For example, a function pass ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:6628,plugin,plugin,6628,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,2,['plugin'],['plugin']

As an author of a multilib configuration, it should be possible to design the; configuration in such a way that it is likely to work well with future Clang; versions. For example, if a future version of Clang is likely to add support; for newer versions of an architecture and the architecture is known to be; designed for backwards compatibility then it should be possible to express; compatibility for such architecture versions in the multilib configuration. Not GNU spec files; ------------------. The GNU spec files standard is large and complex and there's little desire to; import that complexity to LLVM. It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver. While compatibility; with GNU would bring benefits, the cost in this case is deemed too high. Avoid re-inventing feature detection in the configuration; ---------------------------------------------------------. A large amount of logic in the Clang driver is dedicated to inferring which; architectural features are available based on the given command line options.; It is neither desirable nor practical to repeat such logic in each multilib; configuration. Instead the configuration should be able to benefit from the; heavy lifting Clang already does to detect features. Low maintenance; ---------------. Multilib is a relatively small feature in the scheme of things so supporting it; should accordingly take little time. Where possible this should be achieved by; implementing it in terms of existing features in the LLVM codebase. Minimal additional API surface; ------------------------------. The greater the API surface, the greater the difficulty of keeping it stable.; Where possible the additional API surface should be kept small by defining it; in relation to existing APIs.

The GC strategy used with such a collector; should replace the intrinsic calls with the corresponding ``load`` or; ``store`` instruction if they are used. One known deficiency with the current design is that the barrier intrinsics do; not include the size or alignment of the underlying operation performed.

ROOT I/O now support the LZMA compression algorithm to compress data in; addition to the ZLIB compression algorithm.; LZMA compression typically results in smaller files, but takes more; CPU time to compress data. To use the new feature, the external XZ; package must be installed when ROOT is configured and built:. Download 5.0.3 from here tukaani.org; and make sure to configure with fPIC:; ./configure CFLAGS='-fPIC'. Then the client C++ code must call routines to explicitly request LZMA; compression.

Fix schema evolution problem in TTree::Draw by extending support in; TStreamerInfo::ReadValueAux to 'converted' numerical types, (; see issue in ROOT forum). When reading more than one TStreamerInfo for the same versioned; class, we now use the highest possible class version as the current; version of the class. Practically, we update the class version; when reading new (higher versioned) StreamerInfo until the Class; is actually used (i.e. TClass::GetClassVersion is call directly; or indirectly). In particular, if a file has several StreamerInfos for the same; versioned class, we will use the highest version number as the; 'current' class version (as opposed to the lowest until now). For backward compatibility TStreamerInfo::BuildCheck compares the checksum of; the on-file StreamerInfo not only to the current value of the class checksum; but also to the checksum calculated using the older algorithms.

In addition, any instruction that writes to a stack spill; should have a `MachineMemoryOperand` attached, so that `LiveDebugValues` can; recognise that a slot has been clobbered. ## Target-specific optimisation instrumentation. Optimisations come in two flavours: those that mutate a `MachineInstr` to make; it do something different, and those that create a new instruction to replace; the operation of the old. The former _must_ be instrumented -- the relevant question is whether any; register def in any operand will produce a different value, as a result of the; mutation. If the answer is yes, then there is a risk that a `DBG_INSTR_REF`; instruction referring to that operand will end up assigning the different; value to a variable, presenting the debugging developer with an unexpected; variable value. In such scenarios, call `MachineInstr::dropDebugNumber()` on the; mutated instruction to erase its instruction number. Any `DBG_INSTR_REF`; referring to it will produce an empty variable location instead, that appears; as ""optimised out"" in the debugger. For the latter flavour of optimisation, to increase coverage you should record; an instruction number substitution: a mapping from the old instruction number /; operand pair to new instruction number / operand pair. Consider if we replace; a three-address add instruction with a two-address add:. ```text; %2:gr32 = ADD32rr %0, %1, debug-instr-number 1; ```. becomes. ```text; %2:gr32 = ADD32rr %0(tied-def 0), %1, debug-instr-number 2; ```. With a substitution from ""instruction number 1 operand 0"" to ""instruction number; 2 operand 0"" recorded in the `MachineFunction`. In `LiveDebugValues`,; `DBG_INSTR_REF`s will be mapped through the substitution table to find the most; recent instruction number / operand number of the value it refers to. Use `MachineFunction::substituteDebugValuesForInst` to automatically produce; substitutions between an old and new instruction.

To make this possible new TVirtualPadPainter,; TPadPainter, TGLPadPainter classes were introduced; and painting operations inside TPad class were modified to; use TVirtualPadPainter instead of TVirtualX.; TVirtualPadPainter is an abstract base class, interface for; drawing 2D primitives and pixmap management. TPadPainter is; a default, non-GL implementation, based on TVirtualX; (gVirtualX). TGLPadPainter is a GL; implementation. Currently, TGLPadPainter does not support; off-screen rendering (support for frame-buffer objects is planned). Current limitations:. The glpad can be saved only as PS now.; Several sub-pads with complex 3d geometry can be slow due to lack; of off-screen rendering which would allow for caching of resulting images. Future directions:. Use frame-buffer objects for off-screen rendering.; Support ""Save as"" png, jpg, pdf, etc.; With GLEW and GL-shading-language, use of hardware anti-aliasing and; shaders is possible. Prototype visualization of 5-dimensional distributions:. New option for TTree::Draw - ""gl5d"", for the case you have 5 and; more dimensional dataset.; Set of iso-surfaces created, 4-th dimension is used to select iso-level.; ""gl5d"" is now very similar to ""gliso"" option, but instead of; filling TH3 o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/graf3d/doc/v524/index.html:389,config,configure,389,graf3d/doc/v524/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/graf3d/doc/v524/index.html,2,['config'],['configure']

Modifiability,". RooFit Package. RooFit 3.50 has undergone a substantial amount of core engineering to improve computational efficiency; and improve algorithmic likelihood optimizations. The expected increases in execution speed range from; roughly 20% (for problems that were already implemented in a close-to optimal form) to more than 2000%; for certain type of problems. Below is a summary of the changes made. All of these changes are; transparent to end-use cases ; ; ; New implementation of RooFit data types. The implementation of data stored in RooDataSet and RooDataHist; was historically handled by ROOT TTrees (though class RooTreeDataStore). The default storage type; has now been changed to class RooVectorDataStore which stores the information in STL arrays. Existing; datasets based on trees can be read in transparently, and are converted to vector form in the ; persistent-to-transient conversion (the datafile is not modified in this operation); ; The vector store has two important advantages: 1) faster data access (raw data access times are 70 times ; faster than for TTrees), 2) ability to rewrite columns on the fly. The first advantage is important; for the existing constant-term precalculation optimization in roofit likelihoods as these are now; also stored in vectors rather than trees. The faster access speed of vectors make that the constant; term optimization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase. This is particulatly noticeable in pdfs with; many constant expressions from pdfs that were moderately fast to begin with (e.g. RooHistPdf).; The second advantages allows new types of algorithmic likelihood optimization in RooFit detailed below. New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals).

Modifiability,". RooFit; New infrastructure for toy MC studies. A new class RooStudyManager has been added that is intended; to replace the present RooMCStudy framework for toy MC; studies on the time scale of ROOT release 5.26. The present RooMCStudy is a small monolithic driver to; execute 'generate-and-fit' style MC studies for a given pdf. It; provides some room for customization, through modules inheriting from; RooAbsMCStudyModule that can modify the standard behavior, but its; design limits the amount of flexibility.; In the new RooStudyManager design, the functionality of; RooMCStudy has been split into two classes: class; RooStudyManager which manages the logistics of running; repetitive studies and class RooGenFitStudy which implements; the functionality of the 'generate-and-fit'-style study of RooMCStudy.; The new design has two big advantages:. Complete freedom in the design of studies, either by tailoring the behavior of RooGenFitStudy or; by using another study module that inherits from RooAbsStudy, and the data that they return.; More flexibility in the mode of execution. The new study manager can execute all study; modules inlines, as was done in RooMCStudy), but also parallelized through PROOF (at present; only PROOF-lite is support, as well as in batch.

Modifiability,". TMVA. TMVA version 4.0.4 is included in this root release. Methods. A new Category method allowing the user to; separate the training data (and accordingly the application; data) into disjoint sub-populations exhibiting significantly; different properties. The separation into phase space regions is; done by applying requirements on the input and/or spectator; variables. In each of these disjoint regions (each event must; belong to one and only one region), an independent training is; performed using the most appropriate MVA method, training; options and set of training variables in that zone. The division; into categories in presence of distinct sub-populations reduces; the correlations between the training variables, improves the; modelling, and hence increases the classification and regression; performance. Presently, the Category method works for; classification only, but regression will follow soon. Please; contact us if urgently needed. An example scripts and data files illustrating how the new; Category method is configured and used.

Variable transformations can now be applied to a user-defined subset; of variables (and regression targets).; Enable variable transformations for general boosting; Extended PDEFoam functionality:. Multiclass classification by training of one discriminator foam for each; variable.; The cell tree can now be plotted from the macro test/PlotFoams. This makes; it easyer to compare the PDEFoam structure to a decision tree.; Variable importance ranking by counting the number of cuts made in each; dimension. The variable, for which the most cuts were done is ranked highest. Fixed the size of the sampling box in PDEFoam:; In TMVA 4.1.0 the size of the PDEFoam sampling box in each dimension was; 2*VolFrac times the foam size. This was contrary to the intention and the; documentation in the UserGuide and is now corrected: In TMVA 4.1.1 the size; of the PDEFoam sampling box in each dimension is now VolFrac times the foam; size. This implies that in TMVA 4.1.1 the VolFrac value for training a PDEFoam; must be doubled in order to give the same results as in TMVA 4.1.0. The default; VolFrac value was also changed from 0.0333 to 0.0666.; New configuration variable ""NbinsMVAoutput"" defining the bins of the MVA output; variables in the TMVA training plots produced via the GUI.

The; experienced user looking for special topics may find these chapters; useful: see ""Networking"", ""Writing a Graphical User Interface"",; ""Threads"", and ""PROOF: Parallel Processing"". ## Conventions Used in This Book. We tried to follow a style convention for the sake of clarity. The; styles in used are described below. To show source code in scripts or source files:. ``` {.cpp}; {; cout << "" Hello"" << endl;; float x = 3.;; float y = 5.;; int i = 101;; cout <<"" x = ""<<x<<"" y = ""<<y<<"" i = ""<<i<< endl;; }; ```. To show the ROOT command line, we show the ROOT prompt without numbers.; In the interactive system, the ROOT prompt has a line number; (`root[12]`); for the sake of simplicity, the line numbers are left; off. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TLine l; root[] l.Print(); TLine X1=0.000000 Y1=0.000000 X2=0.000000 Y2=0.000000; ```. Italic bold monotype font indicates a global variable, for example; ***`gDirectory`***. When a variable term is used, it is shown between angled brackets. In; the example below the variable term \<library\> can be replaced with; any library in the `$ROOTSYS` directory: `$ROOTSYS/<library>/inc.`. ## The Framework. ROOT is an object-oriented framework aimed at solving the data; analysis challenges of high-energy physics. There are two key words in; this definition, object oriented and framework. First, we explain what; we mean by a framework and then why it is an object-oriented; framework. ### What Is a Framework?. Programming inside a framework is a little like living in a city.; Plumbing, electricity, telephone, and transportation are services; provided by the city. In your house, you have interfaces to the; services such as light switches, electrical outlets, and telephones.; The details, for example, the routing algorithm of the phone switching; system, are transparent to you as the user.

Modifiability,". The default in TFileMerger is to call Merge for every object; in the series (i.e the collection has exactly one element) in; order to save memory (by not having all the object in memory; at the same time). However for histograms, the default is to first load all the; objects and then merge them in one go ; this is customizable; when creating the TFileMerger object. Asynchronous Prefetching; The prefetching mechanism uses two new classes (TFilePrefetch; and TFPBlock) to prefetch in advance a block of tree entries. There; is a thread which takes care of actually transferring the blocks and; making them available to the main requesting thread. Therefore, the time; spent by the main thread waiting for the data before processing considerably; decreases. Besides the prefetching mechanisms there is also a local; caching option which can be enabled by the user. Both capabilities are; disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by the user. In order to enable the prefetching the user must set the rootrc environment; variable TFile.AsyncPrefetching as follows:; gEnv->SetValue(""TFile.AsyncPrefetching"", 1). Only when the; prefetching is enabled can the user set the local cache directory in; which the file transferred will be saved. For subsequent reads of the; same file the system will use the local copy of the file from cache.; To set up a local cache directory, the client can use the following commands:. TString cachedir=""file:/tmp/xcache/"";; // or using xrootd on port 2000; // TString cachedir=""root://localhost:2000//tmp/xrdcache1/"";; gEnv->SetValue(""Cache.Directory"", cachedir.Data());. The TFilePrefetch class is responsible for actually reading; and storing the requests received from the main thread. It also creates; the working thread which will transfer all the information. Apart from; managing the block requests, it also deals with caching the blocks on; the local machine and retrieving them when necessary.

The index; of the current suspension point of the coroutine is emitted as `__coro_index`.; In the above example, the `__coro_index` value of `1` means the coroutine; stopped at the second suspend point (Note that `__coro_index` is zero indexed); which is the first `co_await await_counter{};` in `coro_task`. Note that the; first initial suspend point is the compiler generated; `co_await promise_type::initial_suspend()`. However, when optimizations are enabled, the printed result changes drastically:. .. parsed-literal::. {__resume_fn = 0x401280 <coro_task(int)>, __destroy_fn = 0x401390 <coro_task(int)>, __promise = {count = 1}, __int_32_0 = 43, __coro_index = 1 '\001'}. Unused values are optimized out, as well as the name of the local variable `a`.; The only information remained is the value of a 32 bit integer. In this simple; case, it seems to be pretty clear that `__int_32_0` represents `a`. However, it; is not true. An important note with optimization is that the value of a variable may not; properly express the intended value in the source code. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. static task coro_task(int v) {; int a = v;; co_await await_counter{};; a++; // __int_32_0 is 43 here; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; a++; // __int_32_0 is still 43 here; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; a++; // __int_32_0 is still 43 here!; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; co_await await_counter{};; a++; // __int_32_0 is still 43 here!!; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; a++; // Why is __int_32_0 still 43 here?; std::cout << a << ""\n"";; }. When debugging step-by-step, the value of `__int_32_0` seemingly does not; change, despite being frequently incremented, and instead is always `43`.; While this might be surprising, this is a result of the optimizer recognizing; that it can eliminate most of the load/store operations. The above code gets; optimized to the equivalent of:. .. code-block:: c++. static task coro_task(int v) {; store v to __int_32_0 in the frame; co_await await_counter{};; a = load __int_32_0; std::cou",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DebuggingCoroutines.rst:8871,variab,variable,8871,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DebuggingCoroutines.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DebuggingCoroutines.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,". The new multilib system does multilib selection based on only a limited set of; command line options, and limits which flags can be used for multilib; selection. This is in order to avoid committing to too large an interface.; Later LLVM versions can add support for multilib selection from more command; line options as needed. Extensible; ----------. It is likely that the configuration format will need to evolve in future to; adapt to new requirements.; Using a format like YAML that supports key-value pairs helps here as it's; trivial to add new keys alongside existing ones. Backwards compatibility; -----------------------. New versions of Clang should be able to use configuration written for earlier; Clang versions.; To avoid behaving in a way that may be subtly incorrect, Clang should be able; to detect if the configuration is too new and emit an error. Forwards compatibility; ----------------------. As an author of a multilib configuration, it should be possible to design the; configuration in such a way that it is likely to work well with future Clang; versions. For example, if a future version of Clang is likely to add support; for newer versions of an architecture and the architecture is known to be; designed for backwards compatibility then it should be possible to express; compatibility for such architecture versions in the multilib configuration. Not GNU spec files; ------------------. The GNU spec files standard is large and complex and there's little desire to; import that complexity to LLVM. It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver.

There are two; ways to do so:. * Directly call the parsing process by using the `-cc1` option; this; has the downside of not configuring the default header search paths, so; you'll need to specify the full system path configuration on the command; line.; * Use clang as usual, but prefix all arguments to the cc1 process with; `-Xclang`. For example, to run the ``print-function-names`` plugin over a source file in; clang, first build the plugin, and then call clang with the plugin from the; source tree:. .. code-block:: console. $ export BD=/path/to/build/directory; $ (cd $BD && make PrintFunctionNames ); $ clang++ -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_DEBUG -D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS \; -D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS -D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS -D_GNU_SOURCE \; -I$BD/tools/clang/include -Itools/clang/include -I$BD/include -Iinclude \; tools/clang/tools/clang-check/ClangCheck.cpp -fsyntax-only \; -Xclang -load -Xclang $BD/lib/PrintFunctionNames.so -Xclang \; -plugin -Xclang print-fns.

Using the clang command line; ----------------------------. Using `-fplugin=plugin` on the clang command line passes the plugin; through as an argument to `-load` on the cc1 command line. If the plugin; class implements the ``getActionType`` method then the plugin is run; automatically. For example, to run the plugin automatically after the main AST; action (i.e. the same as using `-add-plugin`):. .. code-block:: c++. // Automatically run the plugin after the main AST action; PluginASTAction::ActionType getActionType() override {; return AddAfterMainAction;; }.

On some architectures (X86_64 is one), sign extension can involve an extra; instruction whereas zero extension can be folded into a load. LLVM will try to; replace a sext with a zext when it can be proven safe, but if you have; information in your source language about the range of an integer value, it can; be profitable to use a zext rather than a sext. Alternatively, you can :ref:`specify the range of the value using metadata; <range-metadata>` and LLVM can do the sext to zext conversion for you. Zext GEP indices to machine register width; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Internally, LLVM often promotes the width of GEP indices to machine register; width. When it does so, it will default to using sign extension (sext); operations for safety. If your source language provides information about; the range of the index, you may wish to manually extend indices to machine; register width using a zext instruction. When to specify alignment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; LLVM will always generate correct code if you don’t specify alignment, but may; generate inefficient code. For example, if you are targeting MIPS (or older; ARM ISAs) then the hardware does not handle unaligned loads and stores, and; so you will enter a trap-and-emulate path if you do a load or store with; lower-than-natural alignment. To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is unde",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.rst:4443,extend,extend,4443,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Frontend/PerformanceTips.rst,1,['extend'],['extend']

In addition, in order to have a common entry point, interfaces classes for these numerical algorithms have been; included.; These interfaces are as well implemented by classes using the GSL library and located in the MathMore library. The library can be loaded automatically using the ROOT plug-in manager.; In detail, the new classes containing implementations present previously in TF1 are:. ; GaussIntegrator and GaussLegendreIntegrator for numerical integration of one-dimensional functions.

This; gives strong security guarantees in that these pointers cannot be incremented or; decremented unless they have an explicit, overriding bounds annotation that can; be used to verify the safety of the operation. The compiler issues an error when; a ``__single`` pointer is utilized for pointer arithmetic or array access, as; these operations would immediately cause the pointer to exceed its bounds.; Consequently, this prompts programmers to provide sufficient bounds information; to pointers.

As a result, the compiler; generates an error suggesting to add ``__counted_by`` to the pointer. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *p, unsigned count) {; for (unsigned i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; p[i] = i; // error; }; }. External bounds annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ""External"" bounds annotations provide a way to express a relationship between a; pointer variable and another variable (or expression) containing the bounds; information of the pointer. In the following example, ``__counted_by(count)``; annotation expresses the bounds of parameter p using another parameter count.; This model works naturally with many C interfaces and structs because the bounds; of a pointer is often available adjacent to the pointer itself, e.g., at another; parameter of the same function prototype, or at another field of the same struct; declaration. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; // off-by-one error; for (size_t i = 0; i <= count; ++i); p[i] = i;; }. External bounds annotations include ``__counted_by``, ``__sized_by``, and; ``__ended_by``.

However the caller may obtain; a pointer to the branch object with GetObject(). Example:. branch->SetAddress(0);; Event* event = branch->GetObject();; ... Do some work. If addr is not zero, but the pointer addr points at is; zero, then we allocate a branch object and set the passed; pointer to point at the allocated object. The caller; owns the allocated object and is responsible for deleting; it when it is no longer needed. Example:. Event* event = 0;; branch->SetAddress(&event);; ... Do some work.; delete event;; event = 0;. If addr is not zero and the pointer addr points at is; also not zero, then the caller has allocated a branch; object and is asking us to use it.

Modifiability,". Understanding Collections. Understanding Collections. A collection is a group of related objects. You will find it easier to; manage a large number of items as a collection. For example, collections of; points and lines might be managed by a graphics pad. A vertex will have a; collection of tracks. A detector geometry contains collections of shapes,; materials, rotation matrices and sub-detectors.; Collections act as flexible alternatives to traditional data structures; of computer science such as arrays, lists, and trees. Collections can be thought of as polymorphic containers that can contain; different types of elements. For this release of the ROOT system, elements; to be placed in collections must be instances of classes.; These may be classes defined by you or provided by ROOT. Collection elements; must be instances of classes descending from ; TObject. The dependence of collections on TObject may disappear; in the future when all C++ compilers used with the ROOT system fully; support templates. In the mean time, knowing the; role TObject plays in collections can be helpful. In general you don't need to worry about TObject. Many ROOT; classes have TObject as an ancestor. In fact, collections themselves; are descendants of TObject. This makes it possible for collections to; contain other collections (subcollections) in a tree structure. Such trees; are used in the ROOT system to implement components of the graphics system; (graphics pads containing pads), geometries (detectors in detectors), etc. The basic protocol TObject defines for collection elements is shown below:. IsEqual(); Compare(); IsSortable(); Hash(). How to use and override these member functions is shown in the; example program. Types of Collections.

Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly.

This in turn implies that without the use of `The walker`_,; initially every ``MemoryDef`` clobbers every other ``MemoryDef``. ``MemoryPhi``\ s are ``PhiNode``\ s, but for memory operations. If at any; point we have two (or more) ``MemoryDef``\ s that could flow into a; ``BasicBlock``, the block's top ``MemoryAccess`` will be a; ``MemoryPhi``. As in LLVM IR, ``MemoryPhi``\ s don't correspond to any; concrete operation. As such, ``BasicBlock``\ s are mapped to ``MemoryPhi``\ s; inside ``MemorySSA``, whereas ``Instruction``\ s are mapped to ``MemoryUse``\ s; and ``MemoryDef``\ s. Note also that in SSA, Phi nodes merge must-reach definitions (that is,; definitions that *must* be new versions of variables). In MemorySSA, PHI nodes; merge may-reach definitions (that is, until disambiguated, the versions that; reach a phi node may or may not clobber a given variable). ``MemoryUse``\ s are operations which use but don't modify memory.

Plugins are defined by a base class (e.g.; **`TFile`**) that will be implemented in a plugin, a tag used to; identify the plugin (e.g. `^rfio:` as part of the protocol string),; the plugin class of which an object will be created; (e.g. **`TRFIOFile`**), the library to be loaded (in short; `libRFIO.so` to RFIO), and the constructor to be called (e.g.; ""`TRFIOFile()`""). This can be specified in the `.rootrc` which already; contains many plugin definitions, or by calls to; `gROOT->GetPluginManager()->AddHandler()`. #### Library AutoLoading. When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class. On; start-up, ROOT parses all files ending on `.rootmap` rootmap that are; in one of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for `MacOS`,; or `$PATH` for `Windows`). They contain class names and the library; names that the class depends on. After reading them, ROOT knows which; classes are available, and which libraries to load for them.

What is it?; scan-build is a command line utility that enables a user to run the; static analyzer over their codebase as part of performing a regular build (from; the command line).; How does it work?; During a project build, as source files are compiled they are also analyzed; in tandem by the static analyzer.; Upon completion of the build, results are then presented to the user within a; web browser.; Will it work with any build system?; scan-build has little or no knowledge about how you build your code.; It works by overriding the CC and CXX environment variables to; (hopefully) change your build to use a ""fake"" compiler instead of the; one that would normally build your project. This fake compiler executes either; clang or gcc (depending on the platform) to compile your; code and then executes the static analyzer to analyze your code.; This ""poor man's interposition"" works amazingly well in many cases; and falls down in others. Please consult the information on this page on making; the best use of scan-build, which includes getting it to work when the; aforementioned hack fails to work.

At this point, Kaleidoscope can build a variety of; applications that are functional and can call functions with; side-effects, but it can't actually define and mutate a variable itself. Strikingly, variable mutation is an important feature of some languages,; and it is not at all obvious how to `add support for mutable; variables <LangImpl07.html>`_ without having to add an ""SSA construction""; phase to your front-end. In the next chapter, we will describe how you; can add variable mutation without building SSA in your front-end. Full Code Listing; =================.

There are multiple different ways to define a matcher, depending on its type; and flexibility. ``VariadicDynCastAllOfMatcher<Base, Derived>``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Those match all nodes of type *Base* if they can be dynamically casted to; *Derived*. The names of those matchers are nouns, which closely resemble; *Derived*. ``VariadicDynCastAllOfMatchers`` are the backbone of the matcher; hierarchy. Most often, your match expression will start with one of them, and; you can :ref:`bind <astmatchers-bind>` the node they represent to ids for later; processing. ``VariadicDynCastAllOfMatchers`` are callable classes that model variadic; template functions in C++03. They take an arbitrary number of; ``Matcher<Derived>`` and return a ``Matcher<Base>``. ``AST_MATCHER_P(Type, Name, ParamType, Param)``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Most matcher definitions use the matcher creation macros. Those define both; the matcher of type ``Matcher<Type>`` itself, and a matcher-creation function; named *Name* that takes a parameter of type *ParamType* and returns the; corresponding matcher. There are multiple matcher definition macros that deal with polymorphic return; values and different parameter counts.

This is an **experimental** feature, available starting with release; 2.3.0.; It is still incomplete and has only been tested on Linux on x86_64. CUDA is supported by passing all JITed code through two pipelines: one for the; CPU and one for the GPU.; Use of the ``__CUDA__`` pre-processor macro enables more fine-grained control; over which pipeline sees what, which is used e.g. in the pre-compiled header:; the GPU pipeline has the CUDA headers included, the CPU pipeline does not.; Building the pre-compiled header will also pick up common CUDA libraries such; as cuBLAS, if installed. Each version of CUDA requires specific versions of Clang and the system; compiler (e.g. gcc) for proper functioning; it's therefore best to build the; backend (``cppyy-cling``) from source for the specific combination of; interest.; The 3.x series of cppyy uses Clang13, the 2.x series Clang9, and this may; limit the CUDA versions supported (especially since CUDA has changed the APIs; for launching kernels in v11). There are three environment variables to control Cling's handling of CUDA:. * ``CLING_ENABLE_CUDA`` (required): set to ``1`` to enable the CUDA; backend. * ``CLING_CUDA_PATH`` (optional): set to the local CUDA installation if not; in a standard location. * ``CLING_CUDA_ARCH`` (optional): set the architecture to target; default is; ``sm_35`` (Clang9 is limited to ``sm_75``).

Modifiability,".. _stl:. STL; ===. Parts of the Standard Template Library (STL), in particular its container; types, are the de facto equivalent of Python's builtin types.; STL is written in C++ and Python bindings of it are fully functional as-is,; but are much more useful when pluggable into idiomatic expressions where; Python builtin containers are expected (e.g. in list contractions). There are two extremes to achieve such drop-in behavior: copy into Python; builtins, so that the Python-side always deals with true Python objects; or; adjust the C++ interfaces to be the same as their Python equivalents.; Neither is very satisfactory: the former is not because of the existence of; global/static variables and return-by-reference.; If only a copy is available, then expected modifications do not propagate.; Copying is also either slow (when copying every time) or memory intensive (if; the results are cached).; Filling out the interfaces may look more appealing, but all operations then; involve C++ function calls, which can be slower than the Python equivalents,; and C++-style error handling. Given that neither choice will satisfy all cases, ``cppyy`` aims to maximize; functionality and minimum surprises based on common use.; Thus, for example, ``std::vector`` grows a pythonistic ``__len__`` method,; but does not lose its C++ ``size`` method.; Passing a Python container through a const reference to a ``std::vector``; will trigger automatic conversion, but such an attempt through a non-const; reference will fail since a non-temporary C++ object is required [#f1]_ to; return any updates/changes. ``std::string`` is almost always converted to Python's ``str`` on function; returns (the exception is return-by-reference when assigning), but not when; its direct use is more likely such as in the case of (global) variables or; when iterating over a ``std::vector<std::string>``. The rest of this section shows examples of how STL containers can be used in; a natural, pythonistic, way. `std::vec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst:691,variab,variables,691,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Top Level; =========. cppyy provides a couple of helper functions at the module level that provide; (direct) access to the Cling interpreter (any C++ code is always accessed; through the global namespace ``cppyy.gbl``).; The documentation makes use of these helpers throughout, so they are listed; here first, but their documentation is more conveniently accessible through; the Python interpreter itself, using the ``help()`` function::. $ python; >>> import cppyy; >>> help(cppyy). `Loading C++`; -------------. C++ code can be loaded as text to be JITed, or be compiled ahead of time and; supplied in the form of a shared library.; In the latter case, C++ headers need to be loaded as well to declare; classes, functions, and variables to Cling.; Instead of headers, pre-compiled code can be used; in particular all of the; standard C++ headers and several system headers are pre-compiled at startup.; cppyy provides the following helpers to load C++ code:. * ``cppdef``: direct access to the interpreter.; This function accepts C++ declarations as a string and JITs them (bindings; are not created until actual use).; The code is loaded into the global scope, thus any previously loaded code; is available from one ``cppdef`` call to the next, as are all standard; C++ headers that have been loaded through pre-compiled headers.; Example::. >>> cppyy.cppdef(r""""""\; ... void hello() {; ... std::cout << ""Hello, World!"" << std::endl;; ... }""""""); True; >>> cppyy.gbl.hello(); Hello, World!; >>> . * ``cppexec``: direct access to the interpreter.; This function accepts C++ statements as a string, JITs and executes them.; Just like ``cppdef``, execution is in the global scope and all previously; loaded code is available.; If the statements are declarations, the effect is the same as ``cppdef``,; but ``cppexec`` also accepts executable lines.; Example::. >>> cppyy.cppexec(r""""""std::string hello = ""Hello, World!"";""""""); True; >>> cppyy.cppexec(""std::cout << hello << std::endl;""); He",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/toplevel.rst:744,variab,variables,744,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/toplevel.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/toplevel.rst,1,['variab'],['variables']

Compiler/linker flags; ---------------------. ``cling-config`` is a small utility to provide access to the as-installed; configuration, such as compiler/linker flags and installation directories, of; other components.; Usage examples::. $ cling-config --help; Usage: cling-config [--cflags] [--cppflags] [--cmake]; $ cling-config --cmake; /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cppyy_backend/cmake. .. _dictionaries:. Dictionaries; ------------. Loading header files or code directly into ``cling`` is fine for interactive; work and smaller packages, but large scale applications benefit from; pre-compiling code, using the automatic class loader, and packaging; dependencies in so-called ""dictionaries."". A `dictionary` is a generated C++ source file containing references to the; header locations used when building (and any additional locations provided),; a set of forward declarations to reduce the need of loading header files, and; a few I/O helper functions.; The name ""dictionary"" is historic: before ``cling`` was used, it contained; the complete generated C++ reflection information, whereas now that is; derived at run-time from the header files.; It is still possible to fully embed header files rather than only storing; their names and search locations, to make the dictionary more self-contained. After generating the dictionary, it should be compiled into a shared library.; This provides additional dependency control: by linking it directly with any; further libraries needed, you can use standard mechanisms such as ``rpath``; to locate those library dependencies.; Alternatively, you can add the additional libraries to load to the mapping; files of the class load",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/utilities.rst:157,config,config,157,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/utilities.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/utilities.rst,6,['config'],"['config', 'configuration']"

In the example below, if the pointers A and B point to consecutive addresses,; then it is illegal to vectorize the code because some elements of A will be; written before they are read from array B. Some programmers use the 'restrict' keyword to notify the compiler that the; pointers are disjointed, but in our example, the Loop Vectorizer has no way of; knowing that the pointers A and B are unique.

In the next chapter, we will describe how you; can add variable mutation without building SSA in your front-end. Full Code Listing; =================.

A new cross-protocol redirection has been added to allow files on EOS mounts to be opened; by `TFile::Open` via XRootD protocol rather than via FUSE when that is possible. The; redirection uses the `eos.url.xroot` extended file attribute that is present on files in EOS.; The attribute can be viewed with `getfattr -n eos.url.xroot [file]` on the command line.; When the URL passed into `TFile::Open` is a for a file on an EOS mount, the extended; attribute is used to attempt the redirection to XRootD protocol. If the redirection fails,; the file is opened using the plain file path as before. This feature is controlled by the; pre-existing configuration option `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` and is enabled by default.; It can be disabled by setting `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` to `0` in `rootrc`. ## TTree Libraries. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen many updates during the last few months.

For example:. asm(""add %al, (%rax)"");; asm(""addw $4, (%rax)"");; asm(""add $4, (%rax)"");.

We could fix this by restricting; the pattern with ``not(isArrow())`` in the definition of ``child_call``. Yet, we; *want* to rewrite calls through pointers. To capture this idiom, we provide the ``access`` combinator to intelligently; construct a field/method access. In our example, the member access is expressed; as:. .. code-block:: c++. access(e, cat(member(m))). The first argument specifies the object being accessed and the second, a; description of the field/method name. In this case, we specify that the method; name should be copied from the source -- specifically, the source range of ``m``'s; member. To construct the method call, we would use this expression in ``cat``:. .. code-block:: c++. cat(access(e, cat(member(m))), ""()""). Reference: ranges, stencils, edits, rules; -----------------------------------------. The above examples demonstrate just the basics of rewrite rules.

Ideally, we'd be rewriting the input AST to a new AST, but clang's AST is not; terribly amenable to this kind of transformation.

[sec:intro]. ## The organization of M ##. The M package acts on a multiparameter *objective function* which is; called — for historical reasons — the $\mbox{FCN}$ function (see; [howto:fcn]). This function is usually a chisquared or a log–likelihood,; but it could also be a mathematical function. The $\mbox{FCN}$; function needs to be written in for which M defines the pure abstract; base class FCNBase as interface. The user must define and implement the; $\mbox{FCN}$ function in a derived class from FCNBase. Sometimes; this is done by an intermediate program such as HippoDraw@bib-HippoDraw,; in which case M is being used under the control of such an intermediate; program[^1]. The value of the $\mbox{FCN}$ function will in general; depend on one or more variable parameters whose meaning is defined by; the user (or by the intermediate program), but whose trial values are; determined by M . To take a simple example, suppose the problem is to fit a polynomial; through a set of data points. Then the user would write a; $\mbox{FCN}$ which calculates the $\chi^2$ between a polynomial and; the data; the variable parameters of $\mbox{FCN}$ would be the; coefficients of the polynomials. Using objects for minimization from M ,; the user would request M to minimize the $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect; to the parameters, that is, find those values of the coefficients which; give the lowest value of chisquare. The user must therefore supply, in addition to the function to be; analyzed, via a set or sequence of M applications the instructions which; analysis is wanted. The instructions are coded in in the calling program; (main.cpp), which allows looping, conditional execution, and all the; other possibilities of , but not interactivity, since it must be; compiled before execution.

Lvalue casts. Old versions of GCC permit casting the left-hand side of an assignment to a; different type. Clang produces an error on similar code, e.g.,. lvalue.c:2:3: error: assignment to cast is illegal, lvalue casts are not supported; (int*)addr = val;; ^~~~~~~~~~ ~. To fix this problem, move the cast to the right-hand side. In this; example, one could use:. addr = (float *)val;. Jumps to within __block variable scope. Clang disallows jumps into the scope of a __block; variable. Variables marked with __block require special; runtime initialization. A jump into the scope of a __block; variable bypasses this initialization, leaving the variable's metadata; in an invalid state. Consider the following code fragment:. int fetch_object_state(struct MyObject *c) {; if (!c->active) goto error;. __block int result;; run_specially_somehow(^{ result = c->state; });; return result;. error:; fprintf(stderr, ""error while fetching object state"");; return -1;; }. GCC accepts this code, but it produces code that will usually crash; when result goes out of scope if the jump is taken. (It's; possible for this bug to go undetected because it often won't crash if; the stack is fresh, i.e. still zeroed.)

Modifiability,".insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. Do Not Use ``using namespace std``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"". In header files, adding a ``'using namespace XXX'`` directive pollutes the; namespace of any source file that ``#include``\s the header, creating; maintenance issues. In implementation files (e.g. ``.cpp`` files), the rule is more of a stylistic; rule, but is still important. Basically, using explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace. As such, it is; ok, and actually clearer, for the ``.cpp`` files to have a ``'using namespace; llvm;'`` directive at the top, after the ``#include``\s. This reduces; indentation in the body of the file for source editors that indent based on; braces, and keeps the conceptual context cleaner. The general form of this rule; is that any ``.cpp`` file that implements code in any namespace may use that; namespace (and its parents'), but should not use any others.

The world needs better compiler tools, tools which are built as libraries. This; design point allows reuse of the tools in new and novel ways. However, building; the tools as libraries isn't enough: they must have clean APIs, be as; decoupled from each other as possible, and be easy to modify/extend. This; requires clean layering, decent design, and avoiding tying the libraries to a; specific use. Oh yeah, did I mention that we want the resultant libraries to; be as fast as possible? :). This front-end is built as a component of the LLVM toolkit that can be used; with the LLVM backend or independently of it. In this spirit, the API has been; carefully designed as the following components:; ; libsupport - Basic support library, reused from LLVM. libsystem - System abstraction library, reused from LLVM.; ; libbasic - Diagnostics, SourceLocations, SourceBuffer abstraction,; file system caching for input source files. This depends on; libsupport and libsystem. libast - Provides classes to represent the C AST, the C type system,; builtin functions, and various helpers for analyzing and; manipulating the AST (visitors, pretty printers, etc).

Modifiability,"//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // Clang Static Analyzer; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. = Library Structure =. The analyzer library has two layers: a (low-level) static analysis; engine (ExprEngine.cpp and friends), and some static checkers; (*Checker.cpp). The latter are built on top of the former via the; Checker and CheckerVisitor interfaces (Checker.h and; CheckerVisitor.h). The Checker interface is designed to be minimal; and simple for checker writers, and attempts to isolate them from much; of the gore of the internal analysis engine. = How It Works =. The analyzer is inspired by several foundational research papers ([1],; [2]). (FIXME: kremenek to add more links). In a nutshell, the analyzer is basically a source code simulator that; traces out possible paths of execution. The state of the program; (values of variables and expressions) is encapsulated by the state; (ProgramState). A location in the program is called a program point; (ProgramPoint), and the combination of state and program point is a; node in an exploded graph (ExplodedGraph). The term ""exploded"" comes; from exploding the control-flow edges in the control-flow graph (CFG). Conceptually the analyzer does a reachability analysis through the; ExplodedGraph. We start at a root node, which has the entry program; point and initial state, and then simulate transitions by analyzing; individual expressions. The analysis of an expression can cause the; state to change, resulting in a new node in the ExplodedGraph with an; updated program point and an updated state. A bug is found by hitting; a node that satisfies some ""bug condition"" (basically a violation of a; checking invariant). The analyzer traces out multiple paths by reasoning about branches and; then bifurcating the state: on the true branch the conditions of the; branch are assumed to be true and on the false branch the conditions; of the branc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt:242,layers,layers,242,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,2,"['layers', 'variab']","['layers', 'variables']"

Mar 25, 2009 - Initial Revision. Most ABIs specify that functions which return small integers do so in a; specific integer GPR. This is an efficient way to go, but raises the question:; if the returned value is smaller than the register, what do the high bits hold?. There are three (interesting) possible answers: undefined, zero extended, or; sign extended. The number of bits in question depends on the data-type that; the front-end is referencing (typically i1/i8/i16/i32). Knowing the answer to this is important for two reasons: 1) we want to be able; to implement the ABI correctly. If we need to sign extend the result according; to the ABI, we really really do need to do this to preserve correctness. 2); this information is often useful for optimization purposes, and we want the; mid-level optimizers to be able to process this (e.g. eliminate redundant; extensions). For example, lets pretend that X86 requires the caller to properly extend the; result of a return (I'm not sure this is the case, but the argument doesn't; depend on this). Given this, we should compile this:. int a();; short b() { return a(); }. into:. _b:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	L_a$stub; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	cwtl; 	ret. An optimization example is that we should be able to eliminate the explicit; sign extension in this example:. short y();; int z() {; return ((int)y() << 16) >> 16;; }. _z:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	_y; 	;; movswl %ax, %eax -> not needed because eax is already sext'd; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	ret. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // What we have right now.; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//.

To avoid forcing the user to do manual memory allocations via `std::vector`, the interfaces of Minuit 2 function adapter classes like `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase` or `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNGradientBase` were changed to accept `std::span<const double>` arguments instead of `std::vector<double> const&`.; This should have minimal impact on users, since one should usual use Minuit 2 via the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface, which is unchanged. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Miscellaneous. * Setting `useHashMapForFind(true)` is not supported for RooArgLists anymore, since hash-assisted finding by name hash can be ambiguous: a RooArgList is allowed to have different elements with the same name. If you want to do fast lookups by name, convert your RooArgList to a RooArgSet. * The function `RooFit::bindFunction()` now supports arbitrary many input variables when binding a Python function. * The `ExportOnly()` attribute of the `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement` object is now switched on by default, and the associated getter and setter functions are deprecated. They will be removed in ROOT 6.36. If you want to fit the model as well instead of just exporting it to a RooWorkspace, please do so with your own code as demonstrated in the `hf001` tutorial. ### Deprecations. * The `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataSet` and `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataHist` functions are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36. The same functionality can be implemented by calling `RooAbsData::reduce` on the Markov Chain's `RooDataSet*` (obtained using `MarkovChain::GetAsConstDataSet`) and then obtaining its binned clone(for `RooDataHist`). An example in Python would be:. ```py; mcInt = mc.GetInterval() # Obtain the MCMCInterval from a configured MCMCCalculator; mkc = mcInt.GetChain() # Obtain the MarkovChain; mkcData = mkc.GetAs",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v634/index.md:5100,variab,variables,5100,README/ReleaseNotes/v634/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v634/index.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"0 x [20 x i32]], i8 }``' type, another; structure. The third index indexes into the second element of the; structure, yielding a '``[10 x [20 x i32]]``' type, an array. The two; dimensions of the array are subscripted into, yielding an '``i32``'; type. The '``getelementptr``' instruction returns a pointer to this; element. Note that it is perfectly legal to index partially through a structure,; returning a pointer to an inner element. Because of this, the LLVM code; for the given testcase is equivalent to:. .. code-block:: llvm. define ptr @foo(ptr %s) {; %t1 = getelementptr %struct.ST, ptr %s, i32 1; %t2 = getelementptr %struct.ST, ptr %t1, i32 0, i32 2; %t3 = getelementptr %struct.RT, ptr %t2, i32 0, i32 1; %t4 = getelementptr [10 x [20 x i32]], ptr %t3, i32 0, i32 5; %t5 = getelementptr [20 x i32], ptr %t4, i32 0, i32 13; ret ptr %t5; }. The indices are first converted to offsets in the pointer's index type. If the; currently indexed type is a struct type, the struct offset corresponding to the; index is sign-extended or truncated to the pointer index type. Otherwise, the; index itself is sign-extended or truncated, and then multiplied by the type; allocation size (that is, the size rounded up to the ABI alignment) of the; currently indexed type. The offsets are then added to the low bits of the base address up to the index; type width, with silently-wrapping two's complement arithmetic. If the pointer; size is larger than the index size, this means that the bits outside the index; type width will not be affected. The result value of the ``getelementptr`` may be outside the object pointed; to by the base pointer. The result value may not necessarily be used to access; memory though, even if it happens to point into allocated storage.

Modifiability,"0.html), it would have; been much easier, because the ghost field would only contain the actual; metadata, and the Store would always know about it. This example adds to my; belief that ghost fields are exactly what we need for most C++ checkers. **Devin:**. In this case, I would be fine with some sort of; AbstractStorageMemoryRegion that meant ""here is a memory region and somewhere; reachable from here exists another region of type T"". Or even multiple regions; with different identifiers. This wouldn't specify how the memory is reachable,; but it would allow for transfer functions to get at those regions and it would; allow for invalidation. For ``std::initializer_list`` this reachable region would the region for the backing; array and the transfer functions for begin() and end() yield the beginning and; end element regions for it. In my view this differs from ghost variables in that (1) this storage does; actually exist (it is just a library implementation detail where that storage; lives) and (2) it is perfectly valid for a pointer into that storage to be; returned and for another part of the program to read or write from that storage.; (Well, in this case just read since it is allowed to be read-only memory). What I'm not OK with is modeling abstract analysis state (for example, the count; of a NSMutableArray or the typestate of a file handle) as a value stored in some; ginned up region in the store. This takes an easy problem that the analyzer does; well at (modeling typestate) and turns it into a hard one that the analyzer is; bad at (reasoning about the contents of the heap). I think the key criterion here is: ""is the region accessible from outside the; library"". That is, does the library expose the region as a pointer that can be; read to or written from in the client program? If so, then it makes sense for; this to be in the store: we are modeling reachable storage as storage.

Modifiability,"000101.jpg). The `AddFriend` method has two parameters, the first is the tree name; and the second is the name of the ROOT file where the friend tree is; saved. `AddFriend` automatically opens the friend file. If no file name; is given, the tree called `ft1` is assumed to be in the same file as the; original tree. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""ft1"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. If the friend tree has the same name as the original tree, you can give; it an alias in the context of the friendship:. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""tree1 = tree"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. Once the tree has friends, we can use `TTree::Draw` as if the friend's; variables were in the original tree. To specify which tree to use in the; `Draw` method, use the syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; <treeName>.<branchname>.<varname>; ```. If the `variablename` is enough to identify uniquely the variable, you; can leave out the tree and/or branch name. For example, these commands generate a 3-d scatter plot of variable; ""`var`"" in the **`TTree`** `tree` versus variable `v1 in `TTree ft1`; versus variable `v2` in **`TTree`** `ft2`. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""ft1"",""friendfile1.root"");; tree.AddFriend(""ft2"",""friendfile2.root"");; tree.Draw(""var:ft1.v1:ft2.v2"");; ```. ![](pictures/02000102.jpg)The picture illustrates the access of the tree; and its friends with a `Draw` command.

The number of entries; in the friend must be equal or greater to the number of entries of the; original tree. If the friend tree has fewer entries, a warning is given; and the missing entries are not included in the histogram. Use `TTree::GetListOfFriends` to retrieve the list of friends from a; tree.

Then we add several types of branches.; The first branch reads seven floating-point values beginning at the; address of `'gstep.vect'`. You do not need to specify `&gstep.vect`,; because in C and C++ the array variable holds the address of the first; element. ``` {.cpp}; t2.Branch(""vect"",gstep.vect,""vect[7]/F"");; t2.Branch(""getot"",&gstep.getot,""getot/F"");; t2.Branch(""gekin"",&gstep.gekin,""gekin/F"");; ```. #### Adding a Branch with a Variable Length Array. The next two branches are dependent on each other. The first holds the; length of the variable length array and the second holds the variable; length array.

They can then merge again from the renaming commit,; resolving all conflicts by choosing their own version. This could be tested on; the [SVE]_ fork. Provisional Plan; ================.

Modifiability,"03_numintcache.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of this feature. Representation of function and p.d.f. derivatives; A new class has been added that can represent the derivative of any p.d.f or function w.r.t. any; parameter or observable. To construct e.g. a first order derivative of a Gaussian p.d.f, do. RooAbsReal* dgdx = gauss.derivative(x,1) ;. A more complete example is available in the new tutorial macro rf111_derivatives.C. Improved handling of chi-squared fits; Chi-squared fits can now be performed through the same style of interface as likelihood fits,; through the newly added method RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataHist&,...). Functions that can be fitted with chi-squared minimization are any RooAbsReal based function; as well as RooAbsPdf based p.d.f.s. In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density; calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust; the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected; number of events, rather than the observed number of events. Tutorial macro rf602_chi2fit.C has been updated to use this new interface. Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible; In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible; to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values; with associated errors on Y and optionally on X.

Due to ``7`` being unequal to ``5 + 1`` and ``a0463443`` being unequal to; ``a0463440 + 7``. A numeric variable can also be defined to the result of a numeric expression,; in which case the numeric expression constraint is checked and if verified the; variable is assigned to the value. The unified syntax for both checking a; numeric expression and capturing its value into a numeric variable is thus; ``[[#%<fmtspec>,<NUMVAR>: <constraint> <expr>]]`` with each element as; described previously. One can use this syntax to make a testcase more; self-describing by using variables instead of values:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG_OFFSET:]], 0x[[#%X,FIELD_OFFSET:12]]; ; CHECK-NEXT: load r[[#]], [r[[#REG_BASE:]], r[[#REG_OFFSET]]]. which would match:. .. code-block:: gas. mov r4, 0xC; load r6, [r5, r4].

FileCheck Pseudo Numeric Variables; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes there's a need to verify output that contains line numbers of the; match file, e.g. when testing compiler diagnostics. This introduces a certain; fragility of the match file structure, as ""``CHECK:``"" lines contain absolute; line numbers in the same file, which have to be updated whenever line numbers; change due to text addition or deletion. To support this case, FileCheck expressions understand the ``@LINE`` pseudo; numeric variable which evaluates to the line number of the CHECK pattern where; it is found. This way match patterns can be put near the relevant test lines and include; relative line number references, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. // CHECK: test.cpp:[[# @LINE + 4]]:6: error: expected ';' after top le",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:33389,variab,variables,33389,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,2,['variab'],['variables']

Here the difficulties are:. * The control flow is roughly the opposite of basic block order; * The value of the ``!23`` variable merges into ``%bb1``, but there is no PHI; node. As mentioned above, the ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics essentially form an; imperative program embedded in the IR, with each intrinsic defining a variable; location. This *could* be converted to an SSA form by mem2reg, in the same way; that it uses use-def chains to identify control flow merges and insert phi; nodes for IR Values. However, because debug variable locations are defined for; every machine instruction, in effect every IR instruction uses every variable; location, which would lead to a large number of debugging intrinsics being; generated. Examining the example above, variable ``!30`` is assigned ``%input`` on both; conditional paths through the function, while ``!23`` is assigned differing; constant values on either path. Where control flow merges in ``%bb1`` we would; want ``!30`` to keep its location (``%input``), but ``!23`` to become undefined; as we cannot determine at runtime what value it should have in %bb1 without; inserting a PHI node. mem2reg does not insert the PHI node to avoid changing; codegen when debugging is enabled, and does not insert the other dbg.values; to avoid adding very large numbers of intrinsics. Instead, LiveDebugValues determines variable locations when control; flow merges. A dataflow analysis is used to propagate locations between blocks:; when control flow merges, if a variable has the same location in all; predecessors then that location is propagated into the successor.

When a class contains text or derives from a text class, it needs to be; able to set text attributes like font type, size, and color. To do so,; the class inherits from the **`TAttText`** class (a secondary; inheritance), which defines text attributes. **`TLatex`** and; **`TText`** inherit from **`TAttText`**. #### Setting Text Alignment. Text alignment may be set by a method call. What is said here applies to; all objects deriving from **`TAttText`**, and there are many. We will; take an example that may be transposed to other types. Suppose ""`la`"" is; a **`TLatex`** object. The alignment is set with:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] la->SetTextAlign(align); ```. The parameter `align` is a `short` describing the alignment:. `align = 10*HorizontalAlign + VerticalAlign`. For horizontal alignment, the following convention applies:. - 1 = left. - 2 = centered. - 3 = right. For vertical alignment, the following convention applies:. - 1 = bottom. - 2 = centered. - 3 = top. For example, align: 11 = left adjusted and bottom adjusted; 32 = right; adjusted and vertically centered. #### Setting Text Angle. Use `TAttText::SetTextAngle` to set the text angle.

In; contrast, in the code box below, `histo` will be in memory in the; subdirectory because we changed the current directory. ``` {.cpp}; root[] f->cd(""Wed011003""); root[] TH1 *h; gDirectory->GetObject(""histo;1"",h); ```. Note that there is no warning if the retrieving was not successful. You; need to explicitly check the value of h, and if it is null, the object; could not be found. For example, if you did not give the path name the; histogram cannot be found and the pointer to h is null:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1 *h; gDirectory->GetObject(""Wed011003/histo;1"",h); root[] h; (class TH1*)0x10767de0; root[] TH1 *h; gDirectory->GetObject(""histo;1"",h); root[] h; (class TH1*)0x0; ```. To remove a subdirectory you need to use `TDirectory::Delete`. There is; no **`TDirectory::rmdir`**. The Delete method takes a string containing; the variable name and cycle number as a parameter. ``` {.cpp}; void Delete(const char *namecycle); ```. The `namecycle` string has the format `name;cycle`. The next are some; rules to remember:. - `name` = \* means all, but don't remove the subdirectories. - `cycle` =\* means all cycles (memory and file). - `cycle` ="""" means apply to a memory object. - `cycle` = 9999 also means apply to a memory object. - `namecycle` = """" means the same as `namecycle` =""T\*"". - `namecycle` = `T*` delete subdirectories. For example to delete a directory from a file, you must specify the; directory cycle:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] f->Delete(""Wed011003;1""); ```. Some other examples of `namecycle` format are:. - `foo`:delete the object named `foo` from memory. - `foo;1`: delete the cycle 1 of the object named `foo` from the file. - `foo;*`: delete all cycles of `foo` from the file and also from; memory. - `*;2`: delete all objects with cycle number 2 from the file. - `*;*: delete` all objects from memory and from ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:40752,variab,variable,40752,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['variab'],['variable']

Said function must have the following; prototype: ``extern ""C"" const char* __scudo_default_options(void)``, with a; default visibility.

In general, if any dbg.value has its operand optimized out and cannot be; recovered, then a kill dbg.value is necessary to terminate earlier variable; locations. Additional kill dbg.values may be necessary when the debugger can; observe re-ordering of assignments. How variable location metadata is transformed during CodeGen; ============================================================. LLVM preserves debug information throughout mid-level and backend passes,; ultimately producing a mapping between source-level information and; instruction ranges. This; is relatively straightforwards for line number information, as mapping; instructions to line numbers is a simple association. For variable locations; however the story is more complex. As each ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic; represents a source-level assignment of a value to a source variable, the; variable location intrinsics effectively embed a small imperative program; within the LLVM IR. By the end of CodeGen, this becomes a mapping from each; variable to their machine locations over ranges of instructions.; From IR to object emission, the major transformations wh",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:23701,variab,variable,23701,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

Observe first that there is a DBG_VALUE instruction for every ``llvm.dbg.value``; intrinsic in the source IR, ensuring no source level assignments go missing.; Then consider the different ways in which variable locations have been recorded:. * For the first dbg.value an immediate operand is used to record a zero value.; * The dbg.value of the PHI instruction leads to a DBG_VALUE of virtual register; ``%0``.; * The first GEP has its effect folded into the first load instruction; (as a 4-byte offset), but the variable location is salvaged by folding; the GEPs effect into the DIExpression.; * The second GEP is also folded into the corresponding load. However, it is; insufficiently simple to be salvaged, and is emitted as a ``$noreg``; DBG_VALUE, indicating that the variable takes on an undefined location.; * The final dbg.value has its Value placed in virtual register ``%1``. Instruction Scheduling; ----------------------. A number of passes can reschedule instructions, notably instruction selection; and the pre-and-post RA machine schedulers. Instruction scheduling can; significantly change the nature of the program -- in the (very unlikely) worst; case the instruction sequence could be completely reversed. In such; circumstances LLVM follows the principle applied to optimizations, that it is; better for the debugger not to display any state than a misleading state.; Thus, whenever instructions are advanced in order of execution, any; corresponding DBG_VALUE is kept in its original position, and if an instruction; is delayed then the variable is given an undefined location for the duration; of the delay.

The above is equivalent to:. ::. %m = @llvm.get.active.lane.mask(%base, %n). This can, for example, be emitted by the loop vectorizer in which case; ``%base`` is the first element of the vector induction variable (VIV) and; ``%n`` is the loop tripcount. Thus, these intrinsics perform an element-wise; less than comparison of VIV with the loop tripcount, producing a mask of; true/false values representing active/inactive vector lanes, except if the VIV; overflows in which case they return false in the lanes where the VIV overflows.; The arguments are scalar types to accommodate scalable vector types, for which; it is unknown what the type of the step vector needs to be that enumerate its; lanes without overflow.

The `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` and `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` functions accept a command argument to specify the fit range.; One can also fit in multiple ranges simultaneously.; The definition of such multi-range likelihoods for non-extended fits changes in this release.; Previously, the individual likelihoods were normalized separately in each range, which meant that the relative number of events in each sub-range was not used to estimate the PDF parameters.; From now on, the likelihoods are normalized by the sum of integrals in each range. This implies that the likelihood takes into account all inter-range and intra-range information. ### Deprecation of the `RooMinuit` class. The `RooMinuit` class was the old interface between RooFit and minuit. With ROOT version 5.24, the more general `RooMinimizer` adapter was introduced, which became the default with ROOT 6.08. Before 6.26, it was possible to still use the `RooMinuit` by passing the `Minimizer(""OldMinuit"", ""minimizer"")` command argument to `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()`. This option is now removed. ### Increase of the `RooAbsArg` class version. The class version of `RooAbsArg` was incremented from 7 to 8 in this release. In some circumstances, this can cause warnings in `TStreamerInfo` for classes inheriting from `RooAbsArg` when reading; older RooFit models from a file. These warnings are harmless and can be avoided by incrementing also the class version of the inheriting class. ### Compile-time protection against creating empty `RooCmdArg`s from strings. The implicit [RooCmdArg](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooCmdArg.html) constructor from `const char*` was removed to avoid the accidental construction of meaningless RooCmdArgs that only have a name but no payload.; This causes new compiler errors in your code if you pass a string instead of a Roo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:30455,adapt,adapter,30455,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

After this stage is complete the command line should be broken down; into well defined option objects with their appropriate parameters.; Subsequent stages should rarely, if ever, need to do any string; processing. #. **Pipeline: Compilation Action Construction**. Once the arguments are parsed, the tree of subprocess jobs needed for; the desired compilation sequence are constructed. This involves; determining the input files and their types, what work is to be done; on them (preprocess, compile, assemble, link, etc.), and constructing; a list of Action instances for each task. The result is a list of one; or more top-level actions, each of which generally corresponds to a; single output (for example, an object or linked executable). The majority of Actions correspond to actual tasks, however there are; two special Actions. The first is InputAction, which simply serves to; adapt an input argument for use as an input to other Actions. The; second is BindArchAction, which conceptually alters the architecture; to be used for all of its input Actions. The clang driver can dump the results of this stage using the; ``-ccc-print-phases`` flag. For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -ccc-print-phases -x c t.c -x assembler t.s; 0: input, ""t.c"", c; 1: preprocessor, {0}, cpp-output; 2: compiler, {1}, assembler; 3: assembler, {2}, object; 4: input, ""t.s"", assembler; 5: assembler, {4}, object; 6: linker, {3, 5}, image. Here the driver is constructing seven distinct actions, four to; compile the ""t.c"" input into an object file, two to assemble the; ""t.s"" input, and one to link them together. A rather different compilation pipeline is shown here; in this; example there are two top level actions to compile the input files; into two separate object files, where each object file is built using; ``lipo`` to merge results built for two separate architectures. .. code-blo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:6640,adapt,adapt,6640,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['adapt'],['adapt']

Refactoring Action Rules; ------------------------. An individual refactoring action is responsible for creating the set of; grouped refactoring action rules that represent one refactoring operation.; Although the rules in one action may have a number of different implementations,; they should strive to produce a similar result. It should be easy for users to; identify which refactoring action produced the result regardless of which; refactoring action rule was used. The distinction between actions and rules enables the creation of actions; that define a set of different rules that produce similar results. For example,; the ""add missing switch cases"" refactoring operation typically adds missing; cases to one switch at a time. However, it could be useful to have a; refactoring that works on all switches that operate on a particular enum, as; one could then automatically update all of them after adding a new enum; constant. To achieve that, we can create two different rules that will use one; ``clang-refactor`` subcommand. The first rule will describe a local operation; that's initiated when the user selects a single switch. The second rule will; describe a global operation that works across translation units and is initiated; when the user provides the name of the enum to clang-refactor (or the user could; select the enum declaration instead). The clang-refactor tool will then analyze; the selection and other options passed to the refactoring action, and will pick; the most appropriate rule for the given selection and other options.

The line number in an external file may be; substituted with ``*`` meaning that any line number will match (useful where; the included file is, for example, a system header where the actual line number; may change and is not critical). As an alternative to specifying a fixed line number, the location of a; diagnostic can instead be indicated by a marker of the form ``#<marker>``.; Markers are specified by including them in a comment, and then referenced by; appending the marker to the diagnostic with ``@#<marker>``, as with:. .. code-block:: c++. #warning some text // #1; // ... other code ...; // expected-warning@#1 {{some text}}. The name of a marker used in a directive must be unique within the compilation. The simple syntax above allows each specification to match exactly one; diagnostic. You can use the extended syntax to customize this. The extended; syntax is ``expected-<type> <n> {{diag text}}``, where ``<type>`` is one of; ``error``, ``warning``, ``remark``, or ``note``, and ``<n>`` is a positive; integer. This allows the diagnostic to appear as many times as specified. For; example:. .. code-block:: c++. void f(); // expected-note 2 {{previous declaration is here}}.

The curious reader will have noticed that each entry in the context menu; corresponds to a method of the class. Look for example to the menu named; `TAxis::xaxis`. `xaxis` is the name of the object and **`TAxis`** the; name of its class. If we look at the list of **`TAxis`** methods, for; example in <https://root.cern/doc/master/classTAxis.html>, we see the; methods `SetTimeDisplay()` and` UnZoom()`, which appear also in the; context menu. There are several divisions in the context menu, separated by lines. The; top division is a list of the class methods; the second division is a; list of the parent class methods. The subsequent divisions are the; methods other parent classes in case of multiple inheritance. For; example, see the `TPaveText::title context; menu.` A **`TPaveText`** inherits from **`TAttLine`**, which has the; method `SetLineAttributes()`. #### Adding Context Menus for a Class. For a method to appear in the context menu of the object it has to be; marked by `// *MENU*` in the header file. Below is the line from; `TAttLine.h` that adds the `SetLineAttribute` method to the context; menu. ``` {.cpp}; virtual void SetLineAttributes(); // *MENU*; ```. Nothing else is needed, since Cling knows the classes and their methods.; It takes advantage of that to create the context menu on the fly when; the object is clicking on. If you click on an axis, ROOT will ask the; interpreter what are the methods of the **`TAxis`** and which ones are; set for being displayed in a context menu. Now, how does the interpreter know this?

To create; an appropriate compile callback manager we use the; createLocalCompileCallbackManager function, which takes a TargetMachine and an; ExecutorAddr to call if it receives a request to compile an unknown; function.

The new recommended way to get objects from a `TFile` or any `TDirectory` in general is now via `__getitem__`:. ```python; tree = my_file[""my_tree""] # instead of my_file.my_tree; ```. This is more consistent with other Python collections (like dictionaries), makes sure that member functions can't be confused with branch names, and easily allows you to use string variables as keys. With the new dictionary-like syntax, you can also get objects with names that don't qualify as a Python variable.

The general rule is that that divisions are; possible on whatever axis that produces still known shapes as slices.; The division of shapes are performed by the call `TGeoShape::Divide()`,; but this operation can be done only via `TGeoVolume::Divide()` method.; In other words, the algorithm for dividing a specific shape is known by; the shape object, but is always invoked in a generic way from the volume; level. Details on how to do that can be found in the paragraph ‘Dividing; volumes'. One can see how all division options are interpreted and which; their result inside specific shape classes is. ### Parametric Shapes. Shapes generally have a set of parameters that is well defined at build; time. In fact, when the final geometrical hierarchy is assembled and the; geometry is closed, all constituent shapes `MUST`**have well defined and; valid parameters. In order to ease-up geometry creation, some; parameterizations are however allowed. For instance let's suppose that we need to define several volumes having; exactly the same properties but different sizes. A way to do this would; be to create as many different volumes and shapes. The modeller allows; however the definition of a single volume having undefined shape; parameters. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoManager::Volume(const char *name,const char *shape,Int_t nmed);; ```. - `name:` the name of the newly created volume;; - `shape:`the type of the associated shape.

TMath. Fix a numerical problem in TMath::ErfcInverse for small input values. Now the normal quantile function is used for implementing it.; . MathMore. Fix 2 bugs in the quartic equation solver (see issue #49031).; ; A protection has been added against numerical errors which could cause NaN due to wrong inputs to an acos function. This problem appears also in the GSL cubic solver. A new GSL patched cubic function has been then added in MathMore.; ; A wrong statement (coming from the original CERNLIB code but not applicable in this case) has been removed.; . Add support for limited and fixed variables for all the GSL minimizers (""GSLMultiMin""), including the simulated annealing (""GSLSimAn"") and the non-linear least square fit methods (""GSLMultiFit"").; . SMatrix. Remove an unneeded check on the element value in the factorization routines used for inverting the matrices (both for the LU and for the Bunch-Kaufmann factorization). The check was preventing to inverting matrices when some of the matrix elements (like the diagonal) were smaller than an epsilon value set to ~ 10-15. This is not needed since it is enough to check that the values are not zero (i.e. when the matrix is singular).

A thread has a program counter and a private stack to keep; track of local variables and return addresses. A multithreaded process; is associated with one or more threads. Threads execute independently.; All threads in a given process share the private address space of that; process. **`Concurrency`** exists when at least two threads are in progress at; the same time. A system with only a single processor can support; concurrency by switching execution contexts among multiple threads. **`Parallelism`** arises when at least two threads are executing; simultaneously. This requires a system with multiple processors.; Parallelism implies concurrency, but not vice-versa.

Modifiability,":local:. Overview; ========. Welcome to the LLVM project!. The LLVM project has multiple components. The core of the project is; itself called ""LLVM"". This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header; files needed to process intermediate representations and converts it into; object files. Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and; bitcode optimizer. It also contains basic regression tests. C-like languages use the `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_ front end. This; component compiles C, C++, Objective C, and Objective C++ code into LLVM bitcode; -- and from there into object files, using LLVM. Other components include:; the `libc++ C++ standard library <https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_,; the `LLD linker <https://lld.llvm.org>`_, and more.

To create the DWARF location list expression that defines the location; description of a vector of lane program locations, the LLVM MIR ``DBG_VALUE``; pseudo instruction can be used to annotate the linearized control flow. This can; be done by defining an artificial variable for the lane PC. The DWARF location; list expression created for it is used as the value of the; ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute on the subprogram's debugger information entry. A DWARF procedure is defined for each well nested structured control flow region; which provides the conceptual lane program location for a lane if it is not; active (namely it is divergent). The DWARF operation expression for each region; conceptually inherits the value of the immediately enclosing region and modifies; it according to the semantics of the region. For an ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` region the divergent program location is at the start of; the region for the ``THEN`` region since it is executed first. For the ``ELSE``; region the divergent program location is at the end of the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``; region since the ``THEN`` region has completed. The lane PC artificial variable is assigned at each region transition.

Our long term goal is; for the entire codebase to follow the convention, but we explicitly *do not*; want patches that do large-scale reformatting of existing code. On the other; hand, it is reasonable to rename the methods of a class if you're about to; change it in some other way. Please commit such changes separately to; make code review easier. The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to increase the readability and; maintainability of our common source base. Languages, Libraries, and Standards; ===================================. Most source code in LLVM and other LLVM projects using these coding standards; is C++ code. There are some places where C code is used either due to; environment restrictions, historical restrictions, or due to third-party source; code imported into the tree. Generally, our preference is for standards; conforming, modern, and portable C++ code as the implementation language of; choice. For automation, build-systems and utility scripts Python is preferred and; is widely used in the LLVM repository already. C++ Standard Versions; ---------------------. Unless otherwise documented, LLVM subprojects are written using standard C++17; code and avoid unnecessary vendor-specific extensions. Nevertheless, we restrict ourselves to features which are available in the; major toolchains supported as host compilers (see :doc:`GettingStarted` page,; section `Software`). Each toolchain provides a good reference for what it accepts:. * Clang: https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html. * libc++: https://libcxx.llvm.org/Status/Cxx17.html. * GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17. * libstdc++: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#status.iso.2017. * MSVC: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx.

Therefore, the vector and; scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different; work-groups (which may be executing on different CUs) of an agent can be; reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to; ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of different CUs. It; ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a; subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the; requirements of acquire and release.; * The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges; of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence. Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not; change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant; address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.; Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively.

In order to fit a data sets we need a model to describe our data, e.g. a probability density function describing our observed data or; an hypothetical function describing the relation between the independent variables **`X`** and the single dependent variable `Y`.; We can have an arbitrary number `k` of independent variables. For example, when fitting a `k`-dimensional histogram,; the independent variables **`X`** are the bin center coordinates and `Y` is the bin weight. The model function needs to be expressed as function of some unknown parameters. The fitting will find the best parameter value to describe; the observed data. We can use the ROOT **`TF1`** class, the parametric function class, to describe the model function. However the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class, to be independent of the ROOT *`Hist`* library,; takes as input a more general parametric function object, the interface (abstract) class `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, which describe a generic one or multi-dimensional function; with parameters. This interface extends the abstract class `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`, with methods to set/retrieve parameter values and to evaluate the function given the; independent vector of values **`X`** and vector of parameters `P`.; More information about the different `ROOT::Math` function interfaces is available in the Mathematical Library chapter.

Modifiability,"; ---------------------. ABI visibility and default annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Requiring ``-fbounds-safety`` adopters to add bounds annotations to all pointers; in the codebase would be a significant adoption burden. To avoid this and to; secure all pointers by default, ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds; annotations to pointer types.; Default annotations apply to pointer types of declarations. ``-fbounds-safety`` applies default bounds annotations to pointer types used in; declarations. The default annotations are determined by the ABI visibility of; the pointer. A pointer type is ABI-visible if changing its size or; representation affects the ABI. For instance, changing the size of a type used; in a function parameter will affect the ABI and thus pointers used in function; parameters are ABI-visible pointers. On the other hand, changing the types of; local variables won't have such ABI implications. Hence, ``-fbounds-safety``; considers the outermost pointer types of local variables as non-ABI visible. The; rest of the pointers such as nested pointer types, pointer types of global; variables, struct fields, and function prototypes are considered ABI-visible. All ABI-visible pointers are treated as ``__single`` by default unless annotated; otherwise. This default both preserves ABI and makes these pointers safe by; default. This behavior can be controlled with macros, i.e.,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_*ATTR*()``, to set the default annotation for; ABI-visible pointers to be either ``__single``, ``__bidi_indexable``,; ``__indexable``, or ``__unsafe_indexable``. For instance,; ``__ptrcheck_abi_assume_unsafe_indexable()`` will make all ABI-visible pointers; be ``__unsafe_indexable``. Non-ABI visible pointers — the outermost pointer; types of local variables — are ``__bidi_indexable`` by default, so that these; pointers have the bounds information necessary to perform bounds checks without; the need for a manual annotation.

This section is intended for developers who want to use MIR patterns in their; TableGen files. ``NOTE``:; This feature is still in active development. This document may become outdated; over time. If you see something that's incorrect, please update it. Use Cases; ---------. MIR patterns are supported in the following places:. * GlobalISel ``GICombineRule``; * GlobalISel ``GICombinePatFrag``. Syntax; ------. MIR patterns use the DAG datatype in TableGen. .. code-block:: text. (inst operand0, operand1, ...). ``inst`` must be a def which inherits from ``Instruction`` (e.g. ``G_FADD``); or ``GICombinePatFrag``. Operands essentially fall into one of two categories:. * immediates. * untyped, unnamed: ``0``; * untyped, named: ``0:$y``; * typed, unnamed: ``(i32 0)``; * typed, named: ``(i32 0):$y``. * machine operands. * untyped: ``$x``; * typed: ``i32:$x``. Semantics:. * A typed operand always adds an operand type check to the matcher.; * There is a trivial type inference system to propagate types. * e.g. You only need to use ``i32:$x`` once in any pattern of a; ``GICombinePatFrag`` alternative or ``GICombineRule``, then all; other patterns in that rule/alternative can simply use ``$x``; (``i32:$x`` is redundant). * A named operand's behavior depends on whether the name has been seen before. * For match patterns, reusing an operand name checks that the operands; are identical (see example 2 below).; * For apply patterns, reusing an operand name simply copies that operand into; the new instruction (see example 2 below). Operands are ordered just like they would be in a MachineInstr: the defs (outs); come first, then the uses (ins). Patterns are generally grouped into another DAG datatype with a dummy operator; such as ``match``, ``apply`` or ``pattern``. Finally, any DAG datatype in TableGen can be named.

Like function types, the :block-term:`Block type` is a pair consisting; of a result value type and a list of parameter types very similar to a; function type. Blocks are intended to be used much like functions with; the key distinction being that in addition to executable code they; also contain various variable bindings to automatic (stack) or managed; (heap) memory.

The Block referenced is of opaque data; that may reside in automatic (stack) memory, global memory, or heap; memory. Block Variable Declarations; ===========================.

The following are; valid Block variable declarations:. .. code-block:: c. void (^blockReturningVoidWithVoidArgument)(void);; int (^blockReturningIntWithIntAndCharArguments)(int, char);; void (^arrayOfTenBlocksReturningVoidWithIntArgument[10])(int);.

Let's explore how data flow analysis can help with a problem that is hard to; solve with other tools in Clang. ### Problem description. Output parameters are function parameters of pointer or reference type whose; pointee is completely overwritten by the function, and not read before it is; overwritten. They are common in pre-C++11 code due to the absence of move; semantics. In modern C++ output parameters are non-idiomatic, and return values; are used instead. Imagine that we would like to refactor output parameters to return values to; modernize old code. The first step is to identify refactoring candidates through; static analysis. For example, in the following code snippet the pointer `c` is an output; parameter:. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; }. void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c->name = ...;; } else {; c->name = ...;; }; }; ```. We would like to refactor this code into:. ```c++; Customer GetCustomer() {; Customer c;; c.account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c.name = ...;; } else {; c.name = ...;; }; return c;; }; ```. However, in the function below the parameter `c` is not an output parameter; because its field `name` is not overwritten on every path through the function. ```c++; void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->account_id = ...;; if (...) {; c->name = ...;; }; }; ```. The code also cannot read the value of the parameter before overwriting it:. ```c++; void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; use(c->account_id);; c->name = ...;; c->account_id = ...;; }; ```. Functions that escape the pointer also block the refactoring:. ```c++; Customer* kGlobalCustomer;. void GetCustomer(Customer *c) {; c->name = ...;; c->account_id = ...;; kGlobalCustomer = c;; }; ```. To identify a candidate function for refactoring, we need to do the following:. * Find a function with a non-const pointer or reference parameter. * Find the definition of that function. * Pro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:15291,refactor,refactor,15291,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

It offers; less functionality but it has a more liberal license (see LICENSE.TXT in; the topmost) directory, it has no external dependencies, and it works on; all platforms that I tested:; - Linux; - Windows (probably >= 2000); - MacOS; - Solaris; Adding other platforms is trivial. = Internal Design. TextInput.h contains the main interface. The reading can be extended by; adding classes that derive from Reader; the displaying can be extended; by deriving from Display. There can be multiple readers and multiple displays. All displays are; equal, all readers are equal. All displays show the input of all; readers. The terminal / console implementations for readers and; displays are provided. Both readers and displays only attach while; textinput is acively reading input. As soon as the input is done (enter; was pressed), they detach from the terminal, allowing the application; to take control of the terminal, and even to crash without leaving the; terminal in a non-default state. The editor provides basic emacs-like keybinding, as known from e.g.; bash. It supports ^O, ^R (for now without regex), and most word-centric; editing commands. See KeyBinding for details. KeyBinding maps the InputData read from the Reader to Editor::Commands.; The Editor performs the requested editing actions, and the Displays; are informed about the changes. TextInput gives access to the read; state (""are we done?"") and the input. = Why no [N]Curses?. Because of platform independence (well, one could still have a; TerminalDisplayCurses) and because nowadays this is actually rarely; needed. Sure, it's the ""right"" way of interfacing terminals.

Options:; -h, --help show this help message and exit; --use-checker-build=PATH; Use the Clang located at the provided absolute path,; e.g. /Users/foo/checker-1; --use-xcode-clang Use the Clang bundled with Xcode. Operationally, set-xcode-analyzer edits Xcode's configuration files; to point it to use the version of clang you specify for static; analysis. Within this model it provides you two basic modes:. --use-xcode-clang: Switch Xcode (back) to using the clang that came bundled with it for static analysis.; --use-checker-build: Switch Xcode to using the clang provided by the specified analyzer build. Things to keep in mind. You should quit Xcode prior to running set-xcode-analyzer. You will need to run set-xcode-analyzer under; sudo in order to have write privileges to modify the Xcode; configuration files.

Modifiability,"; Users interact with and transfer block objects using :arc-term:`block; pointers`, which are represented like a normal pointer. A block may capture; values from local variables; when this occurs, memory must be dynamically; allocated. The initial allocation is done on the stack, but the runtime; provides a ``Block_copy`` function which, given a block pointer, either copies; the underlying block object to the heap, setting its reference count to 1 and; returning the new block pointer, or (if the block object is already on the; heap) increases its reference count by 1. The paired function is; ``Block_release``, which decreases the reference count by 1 and destroys the; object if the count reaches zero and is on the heap. Objective-C is a set of language extensions, significant enough to be; considered a different language. It is a strict superset of C. The extensions; can also be imposed on C++, producing a language called Objective-C++. The; primary feature is a single-inheritance object system; we briefly describe the; modern dialect. Objective-C defines a new type kind, collectively called the :arc-term:`object; pointer types`. This kind has two notable builtin members, ``id`` and; ``Class``; ``id`` is the final supertype of all object pointers. The validity; of conversions between object pointer types is not checked at runtime. Users; may define :arc-term:`classes`; each class is a type, and the pointer to that; type is an object pointer type. A class may have a superclass; its pointer; type is a subtype of its superclass's pointer type. A class has a set of; :arc-term:`ivars`, fields which appear on all instances of that class. For; every class *T* there's an associated metaclass; it has no fields, its; superclass is the metaclass of *T*'s superclass, and its metaclass is a global; class.

Modifiability,"; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One important issue that the code generator needs to be aware of is the presence; of fixed registers. In particular, there are often places in the instruction; stream where the register allocator *must* arrange for a particular value to be; in a particular register. This can occur due to limitations of the instruction; set (e.g., the X86 can only do a 32-bit divide with the ``EAX``/``EDX``; registers), or external factors like calling conventions. In any case, the; instruction selector should emit code that copies a virtual register into or out; of a physical register when needed. For example, consider this simple LLVM example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32 %X, i32 %Y) {; %Z = sdiv i32 %X, %Y; ret i32 %Z; }. The X86 instruction selector might produce this machine code for the ``div`` and; ``ret``:. .. code-block:: text. ;; Start of div; %EAX = mov %reg1024 ;; Copy X (in reg1024) into EAX; %reg1027 = sar %reg1024, 31; %EDX = mov %reg1027 ;; Sign extend X into EDX; idiv %reg1025 ;; Divide by Y (in reg1025); %reg1026 = mov %EAX ;; Read the result (Z) out of EAX. ;; Start of ret; %EAX = mov %reg1026 ;; 32-bit return value goes in EAX; ret. By the end of code generation, the register allocator would coalesce the; registers and delete the resultant identity moves producing the following; code:. .. code-block:: text. ;; X is in EAX, Y is in ECX; mov %EAX, %EDX; sar %EDX, 31; idiv %ECX; ret. This approach is extremely general (if it can handle the X86 architecture, it; can handle anything!) and allows all of the target specific knowledge about the; instruction stream to be isolated in the instruction selector. Note that; physical registers should have a short lifetime for good code generation, and; all physical registers are assumed dead on entry to and exit from basic blocks; (before register allocation). Thus, if you need a value to be live across basic; block boundaries, it *must* live in a virtual register.

The string ""`->`"" in the comment field of the; members `*fTracks` and `*fH` instructs the automatic `Streamer` to; assume that the objects `*fTracks` and `*fH` are never null pointers and; that `fTracks->Streamer` can be used instead of the more time consuming; form `R__b << fTracks`. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; UInt_t fFlag;; Float_t fTemperature;; EventHeader fEvtHdr;; TClonesArray *fTracks; //->; TH1F *fH; //->; Int_t fMeasures[10];; Float_t fMatrix[4][4];; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; static TClonesArray *fgTracks;; static TH1F *fgHist;; // ... list of methods; ClassDef(Event,1) //Event structure; };; ```. ### The EventHeader Class. The `EventHeader` class (also defined in `Event.h`) does not inherit; from **`TObject`**. Beginning with ROOT 3.0, an object can be placed on; a branch even though it does not inherit from **`TObject`**. In previous; releases branches were restricted to objects inheriting from the; **`TObject`**. However, it has always been possible to write a class not; inheriting from **`TObject`** to a tree by encapsulating it in a; **`TObject`** descending class as is the case in `EventHeader` and; `Event`. ``` {.cpp}; class EventHeader {; private:; Int_t fEvtNum;; Int_t fRun;; Int_t fDate;; // ... list of methods; ClassDef(EventHeader,1) //Event Header; };; ```. ### The Track Class. The `Track` class descends from **`TObject`** since tracks are in a; **`TClonesArray`** (i.e. a ROOT collection class) and contains a; selection of basic types and an array of vertices. Its **`TObject`**; inheritance enables `Track` to be in a collection and in `Event` is a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Tracks`. ``` {.cpp}; class Track : public TObject {; private:; Float_t fPx; //X component of the momentum; Float_t fPy; //Y component of the momentum; Float_t fPz; //Z component o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:60259,inherit,inherit,60259,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['inherit'],['inherit']

Operand bundles are tagged sets of SSA values that can be associated; with certain LLVM instructions (currently only ``call`` s and; ``invoke`` s).

Syntax::. operand bundle set ::= '[' operand bundle (, operand bundle )* ']'; operand bundle ::= tag '(' [ bundle operand ] (, bundle operand )* ')'; bundle operand ::= SSA value; tag ::= string constant. Operand bundles are **not** part of a function's signature, and a; given function may be called from multiple places with different kinds; of operand bundles. This reflects the fact that the operand bundles; are conceptually a part of the ``call`` (or ``invoke``), not the; callee being dispatched to.

Modifiability,"; ``CHECK:`` directives only accept lines corresponding to the body of the; ``@C_ctor_base`` function, even if the patterns match lines found later in; the file. Furthermore, if one of these three ``CHECK:`` directives fail,; FileCheck will recover by continuing to the next block, allowing multiple test; failures to be detected in a single invocation. There is no requirement that ``CHECK-LABEL:`` directives contain strings that; correspond to actual syntactic labels in a source or output language: they must; simply uniquely match a single line in the file being verified. ``CHECK-LABEL:`` directives cannot contain variable definitions or uses. Directive modifiers; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. A directive modifier can be append to a directive by following the directive; with ``{<modifier>}`` where the only supported value for ``<modifier>`` is; ``LITERAL``. The ``LITERAL`` directive modifier can be used to perform a literal match. The; modifier results in the directive not recognizing any syntax to perform regex; matching, variable capture or any substitutions. This is useful when the text; to match would require excessive escaping otherwise. For example, the; following will perform literal matches rather than considering these as; regular expressions:. .. code-block:: text. Input: [[[10, 20]], [[30, 40]]]; Output %r10: [[10, 20]]; Output %r10: [[30, 40]]. ; CHECK{LITERAL}: [[[10, 20]], [[30, 40]]]; ; CHECK-DAG{LITERAL}: [[30, 40]]; ; CHECK-DAG{LITERAL}: [[10, 20]]. FileCheck Regex Matching Syntax; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. All FileCheck directives take a pattern to match.; For most uses of FileCheck, fixed string matching is perfectly sufficient. For; some things, a more flexible form of matching is desired. To support this,; FileCheck allows you to specify regular expressions in matching strings,; surrounded by double braces: ``{{yourregex}}``. FileCheck implements a POSIX; regular expression matcher; it supports Extended POSIX regular expressions; (ERE).

Note that not all-current information held by the modeller is written on; the file. For instance, the painter and checker objects are not written,; as well as the temporary current navigation properties: current node; path, point or direction. On the other hand, all objects belonging to; the geometrical hierarchy will always be written. The idea is to be able; to retrieve the geometry in a ready state, ignoring what the state; variables that can be always re-initialized. When the code is generated; for a given **`TGeoVolume`** in the geometry, just the branch starting; with that volume will be saved in the file. Executing the generated code; will create a geometry that has `MyVolume` as top volume. In this case,; only the materials/media/matrices used effectively in the `MyVolume`; branch are exported to file.

If `hbookfile` is of the form; `file.hbook`, then the ROOT file will be called `file.root`. This; utility converts HBOOK histograms into ROOT histograms of the class; **`TH1F`**. HBOOK profile histograms are converted into ROOT profile; histograms (see class **`TProfile`**). HBOOK row-wise and column-wise; ntuples are automatically converted to ROOT Trees. See ""Trees"". Some; HBOOK column-wise ntuples may not be fully converted if the columns; are an array of fixed dimension (e.g. `var[6]`) or if they are a; multi-dimensional array. HBOOK integer identifiers are converted into ROOT named objects by; prefixing the integer identifier with the letter ""`h`"" if the; identifier is a positive integer and by `""h_""` if it is a negative; integer identifier. In case of row-wise or column-wise ntuples, each; column is converted to a branch of a tree. Note that `h2root` is able; to convert HBOOK files containing several levels of sub-directories.; Once you have converted your file, you can look at it and draw; histograms or process ntuples using the ROOT command line. An example; of session is shown below:. ``` {.cpp}; // this connects the file hbookconverted.root; root[] TFile f(""hbookconverted.root"");. // display histogram named h10 (was HBBOK id 10); root[] h10.Draw();. // display column ""var"" from ntuple h30; root[] h30.Draw(""var"");; ```. You can also use the ROOT browser (see **`TBrowser`**) to inspect this; file. The chapter on trees explains how to read a tree. ROOT includes a; function **`TTree`**`::MakeClass` to generate automatically the code; for a skeleton analysis function. See ""Example Analysis"". In case one of the ntuple columns has a variable length (e.g.; `px(ntrack)`), `h.Draw(""px"")` will histogram the `px` column for all; tracks in the same histogram.

Another example:; ```; TChain::Add(""/path/to/tree/subdir[0-9]/*.root""); ```; This grabs all the root files in subdirectories that have a name starting with `subdir` and ending with some digit. ### Improved efficiency of TTree friends with indices. `TTreeIndex` and `TChainIndex` classes now implement the `Clone` method such that it does not use the ROOT I/O to clone the; index but just does a copy in memory. Notably, this improves processing efficiency for RDataFrame in multithreaded; execution since the same index must be copied over to all the threads and attached to the current tree for proper; event matching. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen a number of updates since the last release. Specifically, 6.32 includes the following changes:. - A major refactoring of the interface, improving consistency across different parts and improving overall robustness. **Note that this is a breaking change with regard to 6.30!**; - The on-disk format has been updated to release candidate 2. **It will not be possible to read RNTuples written in the previous format anymore.**; - Support has been added for several new field types: `std::unordered_set<T>`, `std::map<K,V>`, `std::unordered_map<K,V>`; - Support has been added for on-disk half-precision (IEEE 754-2008 16-bit) float fields. This can be enabled through `RField<float>::SetHalfPrecision()`. On reading, values of such fields are represented as regular, 32-bit floats.; - A new `RNTupleInspector` utility class has been added, to provide information about the on-disk metadata of an RNTuple.; - A new `RNTupleParallelWriter` class has been added, providing (initial) support for parallel writing of RNTuples.; - A new static method `RFieldBase::Check()` has been added, which produces a support status report of a type with regards to RNTuple I/",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:4446,refactor,refactoring,4446,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

There are also requirements that all usage sites of the candidate function must; satisfy, for example, that function arguments do not alias, that users are not; taking the address of the function, and so on. Let's consider verifying usage; site conditions to be a separate static analysis problem. ### Lattice design. To analyze the function body we can use a lattice which consists of normal; states and failure states. A normal state describes program points where we are; sure that no behaviors that block the refactoring have occurred. Normal states; keep track of all parameter's member fields that are known to be overwritten on; every path from function entry to the corresponding program point. Failure; states accumulate observed violations (unsafe reads and pointer escapes) that; block the refactoring. In the partial order of the lattice failure states compare greater than normal; states, which guarantees that they ""win"" when joined with normal states. Order; between failure states is determined by inclusion relation on the set of; accumulated violations (lattice's `⩽` is `⊆` on the set of violations). Order; between normal states is determined by reversed inclusion relation on the set of; overwritten parameter's member fields (lattice's `⩽` is `⊇` on the set of; overwritten fields). ![Lattice for data flow analysis that identifies output parameters](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/OutputParameterIdentificationLattice.svg).

Modifiability,"; compiled and loaded into the ROOT session on the fly. The code repository of RooWorkspace is designed to handle classes that; have either their own implementation and header file, or are part of a group; of classes that share a common header and implementation file. More complicated; structuring of source code into files is not supported. ; ; Also new accessors have been added for discrete-valued functions catfunc(); and stored category functions are now also printed under their own heading in Print(); Parameterized ranges. It is now possible to use RooAbsReal derived functions as range definition for variables; to construct ranges that vary as function of another variable. For example. RooRealVar x(""x"",""x"",-10,10) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; RooRealVar y(""y"",""y"",0,20) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] ; ; RooFormulaVar x_lo(""x_lo"",""y-20"",y) ; ; RooFormulaVar x_hi(""x_hi"",""sin(y)*5"",y) ; ; x.setRange(x_lo,x_hi) ; // Change x to have variable range depending on y; ; It is also possible to define parameterized named ranges in the same way. x.setRange(""signalRegion"",x_lo,x_hi) ;. There are no fundamental limits to the complexity of the parameterized ranges; that can be defined as long as the problem is uniquely defined. For example, given three observables ; x, y and z, one can define a parameterized named range 'R' of x in terms of y and of y in terms of z; and ask to calculate the three dimensional integral of any function or p.d.f in terms of (x,y,z); over that range 'R' and it will be calculated correctly, taking recursive range dependencies into; account. A definition of a range 'R' on the other hand where the bounds of x depend on y and; the bounds of y depend on x is not allowed, and an error message will be printed to complain about; the ambiguity of the problem definition. Integrals over non-rectangular regions are created the; same way as integrals over rectangular regions using the RooAbsReal::createIntegral() function, the; chosen mode ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:3620,variab,variable,3620,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,4,"['parameteriz', 'variab']","['parameterized', 'variable']"
Modifiability,"; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef. Relevant standard; This is intended to match shared variables in C/C++, and to be used in any; other context where memory access is necessary, and a race is impossible. (The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store. This is mostly relevant to; unaligned stores: it is not allowed in general to convert an unaligned store; into two aligned stores of the same width as the unaligned store. Backends are; also expected to generate an i8 store as an i8 store, and not an instruction; which writes to surrounding bytes.

Modifiability,"; formatting of the value. For example, to format a floating point value as a percentage,; you can use the style option ``P``. Custom formatting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two ways to customize the formatting behavior for a type. 1. Provide a template specialization of ``llvm::format_provider<T>`` for your; type ``T`` with the appropriate static format method. .. code-block:: c++. namespace llvm {; template<>; struct format_provider<MyFooBar> {; static void format(const MyFooBar &V, raw_ostream &Stream, StringRef Style) {; // Do whatever is necessary to format `V` into `Stream`; }; };; void foo() {; MyFooBar X;; std::string S = formatv(""{0}"", X);; }; }. This is a useful extensibility mechanism for adding support for formatting your own; custom types with your own custom Style options. But it does not help when you want; to extend the mechanism for formatting a type that the library already knows how to; format. For that, we need something else. 2. Provide a **format adapter** inheriting from ``llvm::FormatAdapter<T>``. .. code-block:: c++. namespace anything {; struct format_int_custom : public llvm::FormatAdapter<int> {; explicit format_int_custom(int N) : llvm::FormatAdapter<int>(N) {}; void format(llvm::raw_ostream &Stream, StringRef Style) override {; // Do whatever is necessary to format ``this->Item`` into ``Stream``; }; };; }; namespace llvm {; void foo() {; std::string S = formatv(""{0}"", anything::format_int_custom(42));; }; }. If the type is detected to be derived from ``FormatAdapter<T>``, ``formatv``; will call the; ``format`` method on the argument passing in the specified style. This allows; one to provide custom formatting of any type, including one which already has; a builtin format provider. ``formatv`` Examples; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Below is intended to provide an incomplete set of examples demonstrating; the usage of ``formatv``.

Let's start with matching all ``for`` loops:. .. code-block:: c++. forStmt(). Next, we want to specify that a single variable is declared in the first; portion of the loop, so we can extend the matcher to. .. code-block:: c++. forStmt(hasLoopInit(declStmt(hasSingleDecl(varDecl())))). Finally, we can add the condition that the variable is initialized to; zero. .. code-block:: c++. forStmt(hasLoopInit(declStmt(hasSingleDecl(varDecl(; hasInitializer(integerLiteral(equals(0)))))))). It is fairly easy to read and understand the matcher definition (""match; loops whose init portion declares a single variable which is initialized; to the integer literal 0""), but deciding that every piece is necessary; is more difficult. Note that this matcher will not match loops whose; variables are initialized to ``'\0'``, ``0.0``, ``NULL``, or any form of; zero besides the integer 0. The last step is giving the matcher a name and binding the ``ForStmt``; as we will want to do something with it:. .. code-block:: c++.

The following sections describe each of these top-level statements. ``class`` --- define an abstract record class; ---------------------------------------------. A ``class`` statement defines an abstract record class from which other; classes and records can inherit. .. productionlist::; Class: ""class"" `ClassID` [`TemplateArgList`] `RecordBody`; TemplateArgList: ""<"" `TemplateArgDecl` ("","" `TemplateArgDecl`)* "">""; TemplateArgDecl: `Type` `TokIdentifier` [""="" `Value`]. A class can be parameterized by a list of ""template arguments,"" whose values; can be used in the class's record body. These template arguments are; specified each time the class is inherited by another class or record. If a template argument is not assigned a default value with ``=``, it is; uninitialized (has the ""value"" ``?``) and must be specified in the template; argument list when the class is inherited (required argument). If an; argument is assigned a default value, then it need not be specified in the; argument list (optional argument). In the declaration, all required template; arguments must precede any optional arguments. The template argument default; values are evaluated from left to right. The :token:`RecordBody` is defined below. It can include a list of; parent classes from which the current class inherits, along with field; definitions and other statements. When a class ``C`` inherits from another; class ``D``, the fields of ``D`` are effectively merged into the fields of; ``C``. A given class can only be defined once.

Identifiers that require other; characters in their names can be surrounded with quotes. Special; characters may be escaped using ``""\xx""`` where ``xx`` is the ASCII; code for the character in hexadecimal. In this way, any character can; be used in a name value, even quotes themselves. The ``""\01""`` prefix; can be used on global values to suppress mangling.; #. Unnamed values are represented as an unsigned numeric value with; their prefix. For example, ``%12``, ``@2``, ``%44``.; #. Constants, which are described in the section Constants_ below. LLVM requires that values start with a prefix for two reasons: Compilers; don't need to worry about name clashes with reserved words, and the set; of reserved words may be expanded in the future without penalty.; Additionally, unnamed identifiers allow a compiler to quickly come up; with a temporary variable without having to avoid symbol table; conflicts. Reserved words in LLVM are very similar to reserved words in other; languages. There are keywords for different opcodes ('``add``',; '``bitcast``', '``ret``', etc...), for primitive type names ('``void``',; '``i32``', etc...), and others. These reserved words cannot conflict; with variable names, because none of them start with a prefix character; (``'%'`` or ``'@'``). Here is an example of LLVM code to multiply the integer variable; '``%X``' by 8:. The easy way:. .. code-block:: llvm. %result = mul i32 %X, 8. After strength reduction:. .. code-block:: llvm. %result = shl i32 %X, 3. And the hard way:. .. code-block:: llvm. %0 = add i32 %X, %X ; yields i32:%0; %1 = add i32 %0, %0 ; yields i32:%1; %result = add i32 %1, %1.

This separation ensures that; buffer overflows on the unsafe stack cannot be used to overwrite anything; on the safe stack. SafeStack is a part of the `Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) Project; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/research/cpi/>`_. Performance; -----------. The performance overhead of the SafeStack instrumentation is less than 0.1% on; average across a variety of benchmarks (see the `Code-Pointer Integrity; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/cpi.pdf>`__ paper for details). This is mainly; because most small functions do not have any variables that require the unsafe; stack and, hence, do not need unsafe stack frames to be created. The cost of; creating unsafe stack frames for large functions is amortized by the cost of; executing the function. In some cases, SafeStack actually improves the performance. Objects that end up; being moved to the unsafe stack are usually large arrays or variables that are; used through multiple stack frames. Moving such objects away from the safe; stack increases the locality of frequently accessed values on the stack, such; as register spills, return addresses, and small local variables. Compatibility; -------------. Most programs, static libraries, or individual files can be compiled; with SafeStack as is. SafeStack requires basic runtime support, which, on most; platforms, is implemented as a compiler-rt library that is automatically linked; in when the program is compiled with SafeStack. Linking a DSO with SafeStack is not currently supported. Known compatibility limitations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Certain code that relies on low-level stack manipulations requires adaption to; work with SafeStack. One example is mark-and-sweep garbage collection; implementations for C/C++ (e.g., Oilpan in chromium/blink), which must be; changed to look for the live pointers on both safe and unsafe stacks.

In cppyy, a great deal of attention has gone into built-in specialization; paths, which drives its performance.; For example, basic inheritance sequentially lines up classes, whereas; multiple (virtual) inheritance usually requires thunks.; Thus, when calling base class methods on a derived instance, the latter; requires offset calculations that depend on that instance, whereas the former; has fixed offsets fully determined by the class definitions themselves.; By labeling classes appropriately, single inheritance classes (by far the; most common case) do not incur the overhead in PyPy's JIT-ed traces that is; otherwise unavoidable for multiple virtual inheritance.; As another example, consider that the C++ standard does not allow modifying; a ``std::vector`` while looping over it, whereas Python has no such; restriction, complicating loops.; Thus, cppyy has specialized ``std::vector`` iteration for both PyPy and; CPython, easily outperforming looping over an equivalent numpy array. In CPython, the performance of `non-overloaded` function calls depends; greatly on the Python interpreter's internal specializations; and Python3; has many specializations specific to basic extension modules (C function; pointer calls), gaining a performance boost of more than 30% over Python2.; Only since Python3.8 is there also better support for closure objects (vector; calls) as cppyy uses, to short-cut through the interpreter's own overhead.

It is therefore expected that this; limitation cannot be eliminated with the usage of any parallel analysis; toolkit. ### Optimisation Regarding N-tuples ###. ROOT automatically applies compression algorithms on n-tuples to reduce; the memory consumption. A value that is in most cases the same will; consume only small space on your disk (but it has to be decompressed on; reading). Nevertheless, you should think about the design of your; n-tuples and your analyses as soon as the processing time exceeds some; minutes. - Try to keep your n-tuples simple and use appropriate variable types.; If your measurement has only a limited precision, it is needless to; store it with double precision. - Experimental conditions that do not change with every single; measurement should be stored in a separate tree. Although the; compression can handle redundant values, the processing time; increase with every variable that has to be filled. - The function `SetCacheSize(long)` specifies the size of the cache; for reading a `TTree` object from a file. The default value is 30MB.; A manual increase may help in certain situations. Please note that; the caching mechanism can cover only one `TTree` object per `TFile`; object. - You can select the branches to be covered by the caching algorithm; with `AddBranchToCache` and deactivate unneeded branches with; `SetBranchStatus`. This mechanism can result in a significant; speed-up for simple operations on trees with many branches. - You can measure the performance easily with `TTreePerfStats`.

It is an error to define a record in the scope of the; ``defset`` that is not of type *class*. The ``defset`` statement can be nested. The inner ``defset`` adds the; records to its own set, and all those records are also added to the outer; set.

For the example above, the; interval `[0.0, 4.0]` is divided into 100 bins of the same width `w`; `X = 4.0 - 0.0 100 = 0.04` for the X axis (dimension). Likewise, for; the Y axis (dimension), we have bins of equal width `w`; `Y = 1.5 - (-3.0) 200 = 0.0225`. If you want to create histograms with variable bin widths, ROOT; provides another constructor suited for this purpose. Instead of; passing the data interval and the number of bins, you have to pass an; array (single or double precision) of bin edges. When the histogram; has `n` bins, then there are `n+1` distinct edges, so the array you; pass must be of size `n+1`. ``` {.cpp}; const Int_t NBINS = 5;; Double_t edges[NBINS + 1] = {0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0};; // Bin 1 corresponds to range [0.0, 0.2]; // Bin 2 corresponds to range [0.2, 0.3] etc... TH1* h = new TH1D(; /* name */ ""h1"",; /* title */ ""Hist with variable bin width"",; /* number of bins */ NBINS,; /* edge array */ edges; );; ```. Each histogram object contains three **`TAxis`** objects: `fXaxis` ,; `fYaxis,` and `fZaxis`, but for one-dimensional histograms only the; X-axis is relevant, while for two-dimensional histograms the X-axis; and Y-axis are relevant. See the class **` TAxis`** for a description; of all the access methods. The bin edges are always stored internally; in double precision. You can examine the actual edges / limits of the histogram bins by; accessing the axis parameters, like in the example below:. ``` {.cpp}; const Int_t XBINS = 5; const Int_t YBINS = 5;; Double_t xEdges[XBINS + 1] = {0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0};; Double_t yEdges[YBINS + 1] = {-1.0, -0.4, -0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0};.

Returning a value allows for chained; assignments like ""X = (Y = Z)"". Now that we have an assignment operator, we can mutate loop variables; and arguments.

The next step is to define the AST node that we will construct.

The cost of retaining ``self`` in all methods was found to be prohibitive, as; it tends to be live across calls, preventing the optimizer from proving that; the retain and release are unnecessary --- for good reason, as it's quite; possible in theory to cause an object to be deallocated during its execution; without this retain and release. Since it's extremely uncommon to actually; do so, even unintentionally, and since there's no natural way for the; programmer to remove this retain/release pair otherwise (as there is for; other parameters by, say, making the variable ``objc_externally_retained`` or; qualifying it with ``__unsafe_unretained``), we chose to make this optimizing; assumption and shift some amount of risk to the user. .. _arc.misc.enumeration:.

Similarly to the previous variants, the canonical driver name; will be preferred, and the compiler will fall back to the actual name.

It is not an error if either of these files is not found. The configuration file consists of command-line options specified on one or; more lines. Lines composed of whitespace characters only are ignored as well as; lines in which the first non-blank character is ``#``. Long options may be split; between several lines by a trailing backslash.

You can add a friend to a chain with the; `TChain::AddFriend` method. With `TChain::GetListOfFriends` you can; retrieve the list of friends. The next example has four chains each has; 20 ROOT trees from 20 ROOT files. ``` {.cpp}; TChain ch(""t""); // a chain with 20 trees from 20 files; TChain ch1(""t1"");; TChain ch2(""t2"");; TChain ch3(""t3"");; ```. Now we can add the friends to the first chain. ``` {.cpp}; ch.AddFriend(""t1"");; ch.AddFriend(""t2"");; ch.AddFriend(""t3"");; ```. The parameter is the name of friend chain (the name of a chain is always; the name of the tree from which it was created). The original chain has; access to all variables in its friends. We can use the `TChain::Draw`; method as if the values in the friends were in the original chain. To; specify the chain to use in the `Draw` method, use:. ``` {.cpp}; <chainname>.<branchname>.<varname>; ```. If the variable name is enough to identify uniquely the variable, you; can leave out the chain and/or branch name. For example, this generates; a 3-d scatter plot of variable ""`var`"" in the `TChain ch` versus; variable `v1 in `**`TChain t1` versus variable `v2` in `TChain`**` t2`. ``` {.cpp}; ch.Draw(""var:t1.v1:t2.v2"");; ```. When a `TChain::Draw` is executed, an automatic call to; `TTree::AddFriend `connects the trees in the chain. When a chain; is deleted, its friend elements are also deleted. ![](pictures/02000108.jpg). The number of entries in the friend must be equal or greater to the; number of entries of the original chain.

The most convenient place to create the index is at the end of the; filling process just before saving the tree header. If a previous index; was computed, it is redefined by this new call. Note that this function can also be applied to a **`TChain`**. The; return value is the number of entries in the Index (\< 0 indicates; failure). ## Branches. The organization of branches allows the designer to optimize the data; for the anticipated use. The class for a branch is called **`TBranch`**.; If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables; will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches.; If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a; point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates; on it. A variable on a **`TBranch`** is called a leaf (yes -; **`TLeaf`**). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that; branches of the same **`TTree`** can be written to separate files. To; add a **`TBranch`** to a **`TTree`** we call the; method **`TTree::Branch()`**. Note that we DO NOT use the `TBranch`; constructor. The `TTree::Branch` method has several signatures. The branch type; differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a; list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a; **`TList`**, or an array of objects. Let's see some examples. To follow; along you will need the shared library `libEvent.so`. First, check if it; is in `$ROOTSYS/test`. If it is, copy it to your own area. If it is not; there, you have to build it by typing make in `$ROOTSYS/test`. ## Adding a Branch to Hold a List of Variables.

The implementation follows `the SPIR; specification <https://www.khronos.org/spir>`_. There are two flavors; available for 32 and 64 bits. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spir test.cl -emit-llvm -c; $ clang --target=spir64 test.cl -emit-llvm -c. Clang will generate SPIR v1.2 compatible IR for OpenCL versions up to 2.0 and; SPIR v2.0 for OpenCL v2.0 or C++ for OpenCL. - x86 is used by some implementations that are x86 compatible and currently; remains for backwards compatibility (with older implementations prior to; SPIR target support). For ""non-SPMD"" targets which cannot spawn multiple; work-items on the fly using hardware, which covers practically all non-GPU; devices such as CPUs and DSPs, additional processing is needed for the kernels; to support multiple work-item execution.

Modifiability,"===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. I suggest that we have the front-end fully lower out the ABI issues here to; LLVM IR. This makes it 100% explicit what is going on and means that there is; no cause for confusion. For example, the cases above should compile into:. define i32 @z() nounwind {; entry:; %0 = tail call i32 (...)* @y() nounwind; 	%1 = trunc i32 %0 to i16; %2 = sext i16 %1 to i32; ret i32 %2; }; define i32 @b() nounwind {; entry:; 	%0 = tail call i32 (...)* @a() nounwind; 	%retval12 = trunc i32 %0 to i16; 	%tmp = sext i16 %retval12 to i32; 	ret i32 %tmp; }. In this model, no functions will return an i1/i8/i16 (and on a x86-64 target; that extends results to i64, no i32). This solves the ambiguity issue, allows us ; to fully describe all possible ABIs, and now allows the optimizers to reason; about and eliminate these extensions. The one thing that is missing is the ability for the front-end and optimizer to; specify/infer the guarantees provided by the ABI to allow other optimizations.; For example, in the y/z case, since y is known to return a sign extended value,; the trunc/sext in z should be eliminable. This can be done by introducing new sext/zext attributes which mean ""I know; that the result of the function is sign extended at least N bits. Given this,; and given that it is stuck on the y function, the mid-level optimizer could; easily eliminate the extensions etc with existing functionality. The major disadvantage of doing this sort of thing is that it makes the ABI; lowering stuff even more explicit in the front-end, and that we would like to; eventually move to having the code generator do more of this work. However,; the sad truth of the matter is that this is a) unlikely to happen anytime in; the near future, and b) this is no worse than we have now with the existing; attributes. C compilers fundamentally have to reason about the target in many ways. ; This is ugly and horrible, but a fact of life.

The modified source distribution must retain the copyright notice and; follow the conditions listed in the `Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/LICENSE.TXT>`_. Can I modify the LLVM source code and redistribute binaries or other tools based on it, without redistributing the source?; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; Yes. This is why we distribute LLVM under a less restrictive license than GPL,; as explained in the first question above. Source Code; ===========. In what language is LLVM written?; ---------------------------------; All of the LLVM tools and libraries are written in C++ with extensive use of; the STL. How portable is the LLVM source code?; -------------------------------------; The LLVM source code should be portable to most modern Unix-like operating; systems. LLVM also has excellent support on Windows systems.; Most of the code is written in standard C++ with operating system; services abstracted to a support library. The tools required to build and; test LLVM have been ported to a plethora of platforms.

In short: you can't. It's actually kind of a silly question once you grok; what's going on. Basically, in code like:. .. code-block:: llvm. %result = add i32 %foo, %bar. , ``%result`` is just a name given to the ``Value`` of the ``add``; instruction. In other words, ``%result`` *is* the add instruction.

Modifiability,"===. Required passes; ---------------. A pass that defines a static ``isRequired()`` method that returns true is a required pass. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class HelloWorldPass : public PassInfoMixin<HelloWorldPass> {; public:; PreservedAnalyses run(Function &F, FunctionAnalysisManager &AM);. static bool isRequired() { return true; }; };. A required pass is a pass that may not be skipped. An example of a required; pass is ``AlwaysInlinerPass``, which must always be run to preserve; ``alwaysinline`` semantics. Pass managers are required since they may contain; other required passes. An example of how a pass can be skipped is the ``optnone`` function; attribute, which specifies that optimizations should not be run on the; function. Required passes will still be run on ``optnone`` functions. For more implementation details, see; ``PassInstrumentation::runBeforePass()``. Registering passes as plugins; -----------------------------. LLVM provides a mechanism to register pass plugins within various tools like; ``clang`` or ``opt``. A pass plugin can add passes to default optimization; pipelines or to be manually run via tools like ``opt``. For more information,; see :doc:`NewPassManager`. Create a CMake project at the root of the repo alongside; other projects. This project must contain the following minimal; ``CMakeLists.txt``:. .. code-block:: cmake. add_llvm_pass_plugin(MyPassName source.cpp). See the definition of ``add_llvm_pass_plugin`` for more CMake details. The pass must provide at least one of two entry points for the new pass manager,; one for static registration and one for dynamically loaded plugins:. - ``llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo get##Name##PluginInfo();``; - ``extern ""C"" ::llvm::PassPluginLibraryInfo llvmGetPassPluginInfo() LLVM_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK;``.

Modifiability,"=======. Generating LLVM code for expression nodes is very straightforward: less; than 45 lines of commented code for all four of our expression nodes.; First we'll do numeric literals:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *NumberExprAST::codegen() {; return ConstantFP::get(*TheContext, APFloat(Val));; }. In the LLVM IR, numeric constants are represented with the; ``ConstantFP`` class, which holds the numeric value in an ``APFloat``; internally (``APFloat`` has the capability of holding floating point; constants of Arbitrary Precision). This code basically just creates; and returns a ``ConstantFP``. Note that in the LLVM IR that constants; are all uniqued together and shared. For this reason, the API uses the; ""foo::get(...)"" idiom instead of ""new foo(..)"" or ""foo::Create(..)"". .. code-block:: c++. Value *VariableExprAST::codegen() {; // Look this variable up in the function.; Value *V = NamedValues[Name];; if (!V); LogErrorV(""Unknown variable name"");; return V;; }. References to variables are also quite simple using LLVM. In the simple; version of Kaleidoscope, we assume that the variable has already been; emitted somewhere and its value is available. In practice, the only; values that can be in the ``NamedValues`` map are function arguments.; This code simply checks to see that the specified name is in the map (if; not, an unknown variable is being referenced) and returns the value for; it.

This text tries to describe gcc semantic for mangling ""abi_tag"" attributes; described in https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Attributes.html. There is no guarantee the following rules are correct, complete or make sense; in any way as they were determined empirically by experiments with gcc5. Declaration; ===========. ABI tags are declared in an abi_tag attribute and can be applied to a; function, variable, class or inline namespace declaration. The attribute takes; one or more strings (called tags); the order does not matter. See https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Attributes.html for; details. Tags on an inline namespace are called ""implicit tags"", all other tags are; ""explicit tags"". Mangling; ========. All tags that are ""active"" on an <unqualified-name> are emitted after the; <unqualified-name>, before <template-args> or <discriminator>, and are part of; the same <substitution> the <unqualified-name> is. They are mangled as:. .. code-block:: none. <abi-tags> ::= <abi-tag>* # sort by name; <abi-tag> ::= B <tag source-name>. Example:. .. code-block:: c++. __attribute__((abi_tag(""test""))); void Func();; // gets mangled as: _Z4FuncB4testv (prettified as `Func[abi:test]()`). Active tags; ===========. A namespace does not have any active tags. For types (class / struct / union /; enum), the explicit tags are the active tags. For variables and functions, the active tags are the explicit tags plus any; ""required tags"" which are not in the ""available tags"" set:. .. code-block:: none. derived-tags := (required-tags - available-tags); active-tags := explicit-tags + derived-tags. Required tags for a function; ============================.

Modifiability,"========; GWP-ASan; ========. .. contents::; :local:; :depth: 2. Introduction; ============. GWP-ASan is a sampled allocator framework that assists in finding use-after-free; and heap-buffer-overflow bugs in production environments. It informally is a; recursive acronym, ""**G**\WP-ASan **W**\ill **P**\rovide **A**\llocation; **SAN**\ity"". GWP-ASan is based on the classic; `Electric Fence Malloc Debugger <https://linux.die.net/man/3/efence>`_, with a; key adaptation. Notably, we only choose a very small percentage of allocations; to sample, and apply guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling; is small enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead. There is a small, tunable memory overhead that is fixed for the lifetime of the; process. This is approximately ~40KiB per process using the default settings,; depending on the average size of your allocations. GWP-ASan vs. ASan; =================. Unlike `AddressSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`_,; GWP-ASan does not induce a significant performance overhead. ASan often requires; the use of dedicated canaries to be viable in production environments, and as; such is often impractical. GWP-ASan is only capable of finding a subset of the memory issues detected by; ASan. Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change.

Modifiability,"========; Overview; ========. Clang Tools are standalone command line (and potentially GUI) tools; designed for use by C++ developers who are already using and enjoying; Clang as their compiler. These tools provide developer-oriented; functionality such as fast syntax checking, automatic formatting,; refactoring, etc. Only a couple of the most basic and fundamental tools are kept in the; primary Clang tree. The rest of the tools are kept in a separate; directory tree, `clang-tools-extra; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/clang-tools-extra>`_. This document describes a high-level overview of the organization of; Clang Tools within the project as well as giving an introduction to some; of the more important tools. However, it should be noted that this; document is currently focused on Clang and Clang Tool developers, not on; end users of these tools. Clang Tools Organization; ========================. Clang Tools are CLI or GUI programs that are intended to be directly; used by C++ developers. That is they are *not* primarily for use by; Clang developers, although they are hopefully useful to C++ developers; who happen to work on Clang, and we try to actively dogfood their; functionality. They are developed in three components: the underlying; infrastructure for building a standalone tool based on Clang, core; shared logic used by many different tools in the form of refactoring and; rewriting libraries, and the tools themselves. The underlying infrastructure for Clang Tools is the; :doc:`LibTooling <LibTooling>` platform. See its documentation for much; more detailed information about how this infrastructure works. The; common refactoring and rewriting toolkit-style library is also part of; LibTooling organizationally. A few Clang Tools are developed along side the core Clang libraries as; examples and test cases of fundamental functionality. However, most of; the tools are developed in a side repository to provide easy separation; from the core libraries",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst:302,refactor,refactoring,302,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']
Modifiability,"=========. As mentioned above, we generally have a strong preference for; builders which can build every commit as they come in. This section; includes best practices and some recommendations as to how to achieve; that end. The goal; In 2020, the monorepo had just under 35 thousand commits. This works; out to an average of 4 commits per hour. Already, we can see that a; builder must cycle in less than 15 minutes to have a hope of being; useful. However, those commits are not uniformly distributed. They; tend to cluster strongly during US working hours. Looking at a couple; of recent (Nov 2021) working days, we routinely see ~10 commits per; hour during peek times, with occasional spikes as high as ~15 commits; per hour. Thus, as a rule of thumb, we should plan for our builder to; complete ~10-15 builds an hour. Resource Appropriately; At 10-15 builds per hour, we need to complete a new build on average every; 4 to 6 minutes. For anything except the fastest of hardware/build configs,; this is going to be well beyond the ability of a single machine. In buildbot; terms, we likely going to need multiple workers to build requests in parallel; under a single builder configuration. For some rough back of the envelope; numbers, if your build config takes e.g. 30 minutes, you will need something; on the order of 5-8 workers. If your build config takes ~2 hours, you'll; need something on the order of 20-30 workers. The rest of this section; focuses on how to reduce cycle times. Restrict what you build and test; Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build; configuration as much as you can. Basic functionality is probably; already covered by other bots, and you don't need to duplicate that; testing. You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.).

Modifiability,"=========. Bytecode is executed using a stack-based interpreter. The execution; context consists of an ``InterpStack``, along with a chain of; ``InterpFrame`` objects storing the call frames. Frames are built by; call instructions and destroyed by return instructions. They perform; one allocation to reserve space for all locals in a single block.; These objects store all the required information to emit stack traces; whenever evaluation fails. Memory Organisation; ===================. Memory management in the interpreter relies on 3 data structures: ``Block``; objects which store the data and associated inline metadata, ``Pointer``; objects which refer to or into blocks, and ``Descriptor`` structures which; describe blocks and subobjects nested inside blocks. Blocks; ------. Blocks contain data interleaved with metadata. They are allocated either; statically in the code generator (globals, static members, dummy parameter; values etc.) or dynamically in the interpreter, when creating the frame; containing the local variables of a function. Blocks are associated with a; descriptor that characterises the entire allocation, along with a few; additional attributes:. * ``IsStatic`` indicates whether the block has static duration in the; interpreter, i.e. it is not a local in a frame. * ``DeclID`` identifies each global declaration (it is set to an invalid; and irrelevant value for locals) in order to prevent illegal writes and; reads involving globals and temporaries with static storage duration. Static blocks are never deallocated, but local ones might be deallocated; even when there are live pointers to them.

Modifiability,"=============; Clang Plugins; =============. Clang Plugins make it possible to run extra user defined actions during a; compilation. This document will provide a basic walkthrough of how to write and; run a Clang Plugin. Introduction; ============. Clang Plugins run FrontendActions over code. See the :doc:`FrontendAction; tutorial <RAVFrontendAction>` on how to write a ``FrontendAction`` using the; ``RecursiveASTVisitor``. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to write a; simple clang plugin. Writing a ``PluginASTAction``; =============================. The main difference from writing normal ``FrontendActions`` is that you can; handle plugin command line options. The ``PluginASTAction`` base class declares; a ``ParseArgs`` method which you have to implement in your plugin. .. code-block:: c++. bool ParseArgs(const CompilerInstance &CI,; const std::vector<std::string>& args) {; for (unsigned i = 0, e = args.size(); i != e; ++i) {; if (args[i] == ""-some-arg"") {; // Handle the command line argument.; }; }; return true;; }. Registering a plugin; ====================. A plugin is loaded from a dynamic library at runtime by the compiler. To; register a plugin in a library, use ``FrontendPluginRegistry::Add<>``:. .. code-block:: c++. static FrontendPluginRegistry::Add<MyPlugin> X(""my-plugin-name"", ""my plugin description"");. Defining pragmas; ================. Plugins can also define pragmas by declaring a ``PragmaHandler`` and; registering it using ``PragmaHandlerRegistry::Add<>``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Define a pragma handler for #pragma example_pragma; class ExamplePragmaHandler : public PragmaHandler {; public:; ExamplePragmaHandler() : PragmaHandler(""example_pragma"") { }; void HandlePragma(Preprocessor &PP, PragmaIntroducer Introducer,; Token &PragmaTok) {; // Handle the pragma; }; };. static PragmaHandlerRegistry::Add<ExamplePragmaHandler> Y(""example_pragma"",""example pragma description"");.

Modifiability,"=============; Type Metadata; =============. Type metadata is a mechanism that allows IR modules to co-operatively build; pointer sets corresponding to addresses within a given set of globals. LLVM's; `control flow integrity`_ implementation uses this metadata to efficiently; check (at each call site) that a given address corresponds to either a; valid vtable or function pointer for a given class or function type, and its; whole-program devirtualization pass uses the metadata to identify potential; callees for a given virtual call. To use the mechanism, a client creates metadata nodes with two elements:. 1. a byte offset into the global (generally zero for functions); 2. a metadata object representing an identifier for the type. These metadata nodes are associated with globals by using global object; metadata attachments with the ``!type`` metadata kind. Each type identifier must exclusively identify either global variables; or functions. .. admonition:: Limitation. The current implementation only supports attaching metadata to functions on; the x86-32 and x86-64 architectures. An intrinsic, :ref:`llvm.type.test <type.test>`, is used to test whether a; given pointer is associated with a type identifier. .. _control flow integrity: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html. Representing Type Information using Type Metadata; =================================================. This section describes how Clang represents C++ type information associated with; virtual tables using type metadata. Consider the following inheritance hierarchy:. .. code-block:: c++. struct A {; virtual void f();; };. struct B : A {; virtual void f();; virtual void g();; };. struct C {; virtual void h();; };. struct D : A, C {; virtual void f();; virtual void h();; };. The virtual table objects for A, B, C and D look like this (under the Itanium ABI):. .. csv-table:: Virtual Table Layout for A, B, C, D; :header: Class, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Modifiability,"==============; SanitizerStats; ==============. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. The sanitizers support a simple mechanism for gathering profiling statistics; to help understand the overhead associated with sanitizers. How to build and run; ====================. SanitizerStats can currently only be used with :doc:`ControlFlowIntegrity`.; In addition to ``-fsanitize=cfi*``, pass the ``-fsanitize-stats`` flag.; This will cause the program to count the number of times that each control; flow integrity check in the program fires. At run time, set the ``SANITIZER_STATS_PATH`` environment variable to direct; statistics output to a file. The file will be written on process exit.; The following substitutions will be applied to the environment variable:. - ``%b`` -- The executable basename.; - ``%p`` -- The process ID. You can also send the ``SIGUSR2`` signal to a process to make it write; sanitizer statistics immediately. The ``sanstats`` program can be used to dump statistics. It takes as a; command line argument the path to a statistics file produced by a program; compiled with ``-fsanitize-stats``. The output of ``sanstats`` is in four columns, separated by spaces. The first; column is the file and line number of the call site. The second column is; the function name. The third column is the type of statistic gathered (in; this case, the type of control flow integrity check). The fourth column is; the call count. Example:. .. code-block:: console. $ cat -n vcall.cc; 1 struct A {; 2 virtual void f() {}; 3 };; 4; 5 __attribute__((noinline)) void g(A *a) {; 6 a->f();; 7 }; 8; 9 int main() {; 10 A a;; 11 g(&a);; 12 }; $ clang++ -fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=hidden -flto -fuse-ld=gold vcall.cc -fsanitize-stats -g; $ SANITIZER_STATS_PATH=a.stats ./a.out; $ sanstats a.stats; vcall.cc:6 _Z1gP1A cfi-vcall 1; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SanitizerStats.rst:609,variab,variable,609,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SanitizerStats.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SanitizerStats.rst,2,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"===============. Introduction; ============. For benchmarking a patch we want to reduce all possible sources of; noise as much as possible. How to do that is very OS dependent. Note that low noise is required, but not sufficient. It does not; exclude measurement bias. See; https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis501/papers/producing-wrong-data.pdf for; example. General; ================================. * Use a high resolution timer, e.g. perf under linux. * Run the benchmark multiple times to be able to recognize noise. * Disable as many processes or services as possible on the target system. * Disable frequency scaling, turbo boost and address space; randomization (see OS specific section). * Static link if the OS supports it. That avoids any variation that; might be introduced by loading dynamic libraries. This can be done; by passing ``-DLLVM_BUILD_STATIC=ON`` to cmake. * Try to avoid storage. On some systems you can use tmpfs. Putting the; program, inputs and outputs on tmpfs avoids touching a real storage; system, which can have a pretty big variability. To mount it (on linux and freebsd at least)::. mount -t tmpfs -o size=<XX>g none dir_to_mount.

If using perf, leave at least 2 cores; so that perf runs in one and your program in another::. cset shield -c N1,N2 -k on. This will move all threads out of N1 and N2.

Modifiability,"===============; Support Library; ===============. Abstract; ========. This document provides some details on LLVM's Support Library, located in the; source at ``lib/Support`` and ``include/llvm/Support``. The library's purpose; is to shield LLVM from the differences between operating systems for the few; services LLVM needs from the operating system. Much of LLVM is written using; portability features of standard C++. However, in a few areas, system dependent; facilities are needed and the Support Library is the wrapper around those; system calls. By centralizing LLVM's use of operating system interfaces, we make it possible; for the LLVM tool chain and runtime libraries to be more easily ported to new; platforms since (theoretically) only ``lib/Support`` needs to be ported. This; library also unclutters the rest of LLVM from #ifdef use and special cases for; specific operating systems. Such uses are replaced with simple calls to the; interfaces provided in ``include/llvm/Support``. Note that the Support Library is not intended to be a complete operating system; wrapper (such as the Adaptive Communications Environment (ACE) or Apache; Portable Runtime (APR)), but only provides the functionality necessary to; support LLVM. The Support Library was originally referred to as the System Library, written; by Reid Spencer who formulated the design based on similar work originating; from the eXtensible Programming System (XPS). Several people helped with the; effort; especially, Jeff Cohen and Henrik Bach on the Win32 port. Keeping LLVM Portable; =====================. In order to keep LLVM portable, LLVM developers should adhere to a set of; portability rules associated with the Support Library. Adherence to these rules; should help the Support Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM from the; variations in operating system interfaces and doing so efficiently. The; following sections define the rules needed to fulfill this objective.

Modifiability,"===============; The LLVM gold plugin; ====================. Introduction; ============. Building with link time optimization requires cooperation from; the system linker. LTO support on Linux systems is available via the; `gold linker`_ which supports LTO via plugins. This is the same mechanism; used by the `GCC LTO`_ project. The LLVM gold plugin implements the gold plugin interface on top of; :ref:`libLTO`. The same plugin can also be used by other tools such as; ``ar`` and ``nm``. Note that ld.bfd from binutils version 2.21.51.0.2; and above also supports LTO via plugins. However, usage of the LLVM; gold plugin with ld.bfd is not tested and therefore not officially; supported or recommended. As of LLVM 15, the gold plugin will ignore bitcode from the ``.llvmbc``; section inside of ELF object files. However, LTO with bitcode files; is still supported. .. _`gold linker`: http://sourceware.org/binutils; .. _`GCC LTO`: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization; .. _`gold plugin interface`: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/whopr/driver. .. _lto-how-to-build:. How to build it; ===============. You need to have gold with plugin support and build the LLVMgold plugin.; The gold linker is installed as ld.gold. To see whether gold is the default; on your system, run ``/usr/bin/ld -v``. It will report ""GNU; gold"" or else ""GNU ld"" if not. If gold is already installed at; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold``, one option is to simply make that the default by; backing up your existing ``/usr/bin/ld`` and creating a symbolic link; with ``ln -s /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld``. Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support.

It consists of a compiler; instrumentation module and a run-time library. The tool can detect the; following types of bugs:. * Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack and globals; * Use-after-free; * Use-after-return (clang flag ``-fsanitize-address-use-after-return=(never|runtime|always)`` default: ``runtime``); * Enable with: ``ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1`` (already enabled on Linux).; * Disable with: ``ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=0``.; * Use-after-scope (clang flag ``-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope``); * Double-free, invalid free; * Memory leaks (experimental). Typical slowdown introduced by AddressSanitizer is **2x**. How to build; ============. Build LLVM/Clang with `CMake <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>` and enable; the ``compiler-rt`` runtime. An example CMake configuration that will allow; for the use/testing of AddressSanitizer:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=""clang"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=""compiler-rt"" <path to source>/llvm. Usage; =====. Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=address`` flag. The; AddressSanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable, so; make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final link step. When linking; shared libraries, the AddressSanitizer run-time is not linked, so; ``-Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it with AddressSanitizer). To; get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher. To get nicer stack traces; in error messages add ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``. To get perfect stack traces; you may need to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail call elimination; (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``). .. code-block:: console. % cat example_UseAfterFree.cc; int main(int argc, char **argv) {; int *array = new int[100];; delete [] array;; r",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst:970,config,configuration,970,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"==================; Advice on Packaging LLVM; ========================. .. contents::; :local:. Overview; ========. LLVM sets certain default configure options to make sure our developers don't; break things for constrained platforms. These settings are not optimal for most; desktop systems, and we hope that packagers (e.g., Redhat, Debian, MacPorts,; etc.) will tweak them. This document lists settings we suggest you tweak. LLVM's API changes with each release, so users are likely to want, for example,; both LLVM-2.6 and LLVM-2.7 installed at the same time to support apps developed; against each. Compile Flags; =============. LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed.; However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without; defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug problems; in user code. We recommend allowing users to install both optimized and debug; versions of LLVM in parallel. The following configure flags are relevant:. ``--disable-assertions``; Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined. Changes the LLVM ABI. Also available; by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s environment. This; defaults to enabled regardless of the optimization setting, but it slows; things down. ``--enable-debug-symbols``; Builds LLVM with ``-g``. Also available by setting ``DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to disabled when optimizing, so you; should turn it back on to let users debug their programs. ``--enable-optimized``; (For git checkouts) Builds LLVM with ``-O2`` and, by default, turns off; debug symbols. Also available by setting ``ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to enabled when not in a; checkout. C++ Features; ============. RTTI; LLVM disables RTTI by default.

Passes; perform the transformations and optimizations that make up the compiler, they; build the analysis results that are used by these transformations, and they; are, above all, a structuring technique for compiler code. All LLVM passes are subclasses of the `Pass; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Pass.html>`_ class, which implement; functionality by overriding virtual methods inherited from ``Pass``. Depending; on how your pass works, you should inherit from the :ref:`ModulePass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-ModulePass>` , :ref:`CallGraphSCCPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-CallGraphSCCPass>`, :ref:`FunctionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` , or :ref:`LoopPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-LoopPass>`, or :ref:`RegionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-RegionPass>` classes, which gives the system more; information about what your pass does, and how it can be combined with other; passes.

Modifiability,"=====================; Debugging JIT-ed Code; =====================. Background; ==========. Without special runtime support, debugging dynamically generated code can be; quite painful. Debuggers generally read debug information from object files on; disk, but for JITed code there is no such file to look for. In order to hand over the necessary debug info, `GDB established an; interface <https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/JIT-Interface.html>`_; for registering JITed code with debuggers. LLDB implements it in the; JITLoaderGDB plugin. On the JIT side, LLVM MCJIT does implement the interface; for ELF object files. At a high level, whenever MCJIT generates new machine code, it does so in an; in-memory object file that contains the debug information in DWARF format.; MCJIT then adds this in-memory object file to a global list of dynamically; generated object files and calls a special function; ``__jit_debug_register_code`` that the debugger knows about. When the debugger; attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in this function and associates a; special handler with it. Once MCJIT calls the registration function, the; debugger catches the breakpoint signal, loads the new object file from the; inferior's memory and resumes execution. This way it can obtain debug; information for pure in-memory object files. GDB Version; ===========. In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is; available on most modern distributions of Linux. The version of GDB that; Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while. LLDB Version; ============. Due to a regression in release 6.0, LLDB didn't support JITed code debugging for; a while. The bug was fixed in mainline recently, so that debugging JITed ELF; objects should be possible again from the upcoming release 12.0 on.

This document describes coding standards that are used in the LLVM project.; Although no coding standards should be regarded as absolute requirements to be; followed in all instances, coding standards are; particularly important for large-scale code bases that follow a library-based; design (like LLVM). While this document may provide guidance for some mechanical formatting issues,; whitespace, or other ""microscopic details"", these are not fixed standards.; Always follow the golden rule:. .. _Golden Rule:. **If you are extending, enhancing, or bug fixing already implemented code,; use the style that is already being used so that the source is uniform and; easy to follow.**. Note that some code bases (e.g. ``libc++``) have special reasons to deviate; from the coding standards. For example, in the case of ``libc++``, this is; because the naming and other conventions are dictated by the C++ standard. There are some conventions that are not uniformly followed in the code base; (e.g. the naming convention). This is because they are relatively new, and a; lot of code was written before they were put in place. Our long term goal is; for the entire codebase to follow the convention, but we explicitly *do not*; want patches that do large-scale reformatting of existing code. On the other; hand, it is reasonable to rename the methods of a class if you're about to; change it in some other way. Please commit such changes separately to; make code review easier. The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to increase the readability and; maintainability of our common source base. Languages, Libraries, and Standards; ===================================.

Modifiability,"======================. In the example above, every variable assignment uniquely corresponds to a; memory store to the variable's position on the stack. However in heavily; optimized code LLVM promotes most variables into SSA values, which can; eventually be placed in physical registers or memory locations. To track SSA; values through compilation, when objects are promoted to SSA values an; ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsic is created for each assignment, recording the; variable's new location. Compared with the ``llvm.dbg.declare`` intrinsic:. * A dbg.value terminates the effect of any preceding dbg.values for (any; overlapping fragments of) the specified variable.; * The dbg.value's position in the IR defines where in the instruction stream; the variable's value changes.; * Operands can be constants, indicating the variable is assigned a; constant value. Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer.

Modifiability,"======================. The inputs for a fuzz target are generated via random mutations of a; :ref:`corpus <libfuzzer-corpus>`. There are a few options for the kinds of; mutations that a fuzzer in LLVM might want. .. _fuzzing-llvm-generic:. Generic Random Fuzzing; ----------------------. The most basic form of input mutation is to use the built in mutators of; LibFuzzer. These simply treat the input corpus as a bag of bits and make random; mutations. This type of fuzzer is good for stressing the surface layers of a; program, and is good at testing things like lexers, parsers, or binary; protocols. Some of the in-tree fuzzers that use this type of mutator are `clang-fuzzer`_,; `clang-format-fuzzer`_, `llvm-as-fuzzer`_, `llvm-dwarfdump-fuzzer`_,; `llvm-mc-assemble-fuzzer`_, and `llvm-mc-disassemble-fuzzer`_. .. _fuzzing-llvm-protobuf:. Structured Fuzzing using ``libprotobuf-mutator``; ------------------------------------------------. We can use libprotobuf-mutator_ in order to perform structured fuzzing and; stress deeper layers of programs. This works by defining a protobuf class that; translates arbitrary data into structurally interesting input. Specifically, we; use this to work with a subset of the C++ language and perform mutations that; produce valid C++ programs in order to exercise parts of clang that are more; interesting than parser error handling. To build this kind of fuzzer you need `protobuf`_ and its dependencies; installed, and you need to specify some extra flags when configuring the build; with :doc:`CMake <CMake>`. For example, `clang-proto-fuzzer`_ can be enabled by; adding ``-DCLANG_ENABLE_PROTO_FUZZER=ON`` to the flags described in; :ref:`building-fuzzers`.

This may preclude; the use of shared libraries in some cases. The compiler will only produce CFI checks for a class if it can infer hidden; LTO visibility for that class. LTO visibility is a property of a class that; is inferred from flags and attributes. For more details, see the documentation; for :doc:`LTO visibility <LTOVisibility>`. The ``-fsanitize=cfi-{vcall,nvcall,derived-cast,unrelated-cast}`` flags; require that a ``-fvisibility=`` flag also be specified. This is because the; default visibility setting is ``-fvisibility=default``, which would disable; CFI checks for classes without visibility attributes. Most users will want; to specify ``-fvisibility=hidden``, which enables CFI checks for such classes. Experimental support for :ref:`cross-DSO control flow integrity; <cfi-cross-dso>` exists that does not require classes to have hidden LTO; visibility. This cross-DSO support has unstable ABI at this time. .. _g",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:868,plugin,plugin,868,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,1,['plugin'],['plugin']
Modifiability,"=======================; LLVM Common CMake Utils; =======================. What goes here; --------------. These are CMake modules to be shared between LLVM projects strictly at build; time. In other words, they must not be included from an installed CMake module,; such as the ``Add*.cmake`` ones. Modules that are reachable from installed; modules should instead go in ``${project}/cmake/modules`` of the most upstream; project that uses them. The advantage of not putting these modules in an existing location like; ``llvm/cmake/modules`` is two-fold:. - Since they are not installed, we don't have to worry about any out-of-tree; downstream usage, and thus there is no need for stability. - Since they are available as part of the source at build-time, we don't have; to do the usual stand-alone vs combined-build dances, avoiding much; complexity. How to use; ----------. For tools, please do:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(NOT DEFINED LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS); set(LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../cmake); endif(). # Add path for custom modules.; list(INSERT CMAKE_MODULE_PATH 0; # project-specific module dirs first; ""${LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS}/Modules""; ). Notes:. - The ``if(NOT DEFINED ...)`` guard is there because in combined builds, LLVM; will set this variable. This is useful for legacy builds where projects are; found in ``llvm/tools`` instead. - ``INSERT ... 0`` ensures these new entries are prepended to the front of the; module path, so nothing might shadow them by mistake. For runtime libs, we skip the ``if(NOT DEFINED`` part:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../cmake). ... # same as before.

Modifiability,"========================; Advice on Packaging LLVM; ========================. .. contents::; :local:. Overview; ========. LLVM sets certain default configure options to make sure our developers don't; break things for constrained platforms. These settings are not optimal for most; desktop systems, and we hope that packagers (e.g., Redhat, Debian, MacPorts,; etc.) will tweak them. This document lists settings we suggest you tweak. LLVM's API changes with each release, so users are likely to want, for example,; both LLVM-2.6 and LLVM-2.7 installed at the same time to support apps developed; against each. Compile Flags; =============. LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed.; However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without; defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug problems; in user code. We recommend allowing users to install both optimized and debug; versions of LLVM in parallel. The following configure flags are relevant:. ``--disable-assertions``; Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined. Changes the LLVM ABI. Also available; by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s environment. This; defaults to enabled regardless of the optimization setting, but it slows; things down. ``--enable-debug-symbols``; Builds LLVM with ``-g``. Also available by setting ``DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to disabled when optimizing, so you; should turn it back on to let users debug their programs. ``--enable-optimized``; (For git checkouts) Builds LLVM with ``-O2`` and, by default, turns off; debug symbols. Also available by setting ``ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to enabled when not in a; checkout. C++ Features; ============. RTTI; LLVM disables RTTI by default.

The LLVM build system is designed to facilitate the building of third party; projects that use LLVM header files, libraries, and tools. In order to use; these facilities, a ``Makefile`` from a project must do the following things:. * Set ``make`` variables. There are several variables that a ``Makefile`` needs; to set to use the LLVM build system:. * ``PROJECT_NAME`` - The name by which your project is known.; * ``LLVM_SRC_ROOT`` - The root of the LLVM source tree.; * ``LLVM_OBJ_ROOT`` - The root of the LLVM object tree.; * ``PROJ_SRC_ROOT`` - The root of the project's source tree.; * ``PROJ_OBJ_ROOT`` - The root of the project's object tree.; * ``PROJ_INSTALL_ROOT`` - The root installation directory.; * ``LEVEL`` - The relative path from the current directory to the; project's root ``($PROJ_OBJ_ROOT)``. * Include ``Makefile.config`` from ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)``. * Include ``Makefile.rules`` from ``$(LLVM_SRC_ROOT)``. There are two ways that you can set all of these variables:. * You can write your own ``Makefiles`` which hard-code these values. * You can use the pre-made LLVM sample project. This sample project includes; ``Makefiles``, a configure script that can be used to configure the location; of LLVM, and the ability to support multiple object directories from a single; source directory.

A tutorial on how to write a source-to-source translation tool using Clang Transformer. .. contents::; :local:. What is Clang Transformer?; --------------------------. Clang Transformer is a framework for writing C++ diagnostics and program; transformations. It is built on the clang toolchain and the LibTooling library,; but aims to hide much of the complexity of clang's native, low-level libraries. The core abstraction of Transformer is the *rewrite rule*, which specifies how; to change a given program pattern into a new form. Here are some examples of; tasks you can achieve with Transformer:. * warn against using the name ``MkX`` for a declared function,; * change ``MkX`` to ``MakeX``, where ``MkX`` is the name of a declared function,; * change ``s.size()`` to ``Size(s)``, where ``s`` is a ``string``,; * collapse ``e.child().m()`` to ``e.m()``, for any expression ``e`` and method named; ``m``. All of the examples have a common form: they identify a pattern that is the; target of the transformation, they specify an *edit* to the code identified by; the pattern, and their pattern and edit refer to common variables, like ``s``,; ``e``, and ``m``, that range over code fragments. Our first and second examples also; specify constraints on the pattern that aren't apparent from the syntax alone,; like ""``s`` is a ``string``."" Even the first example (""warn ..."") shares this form,; even though it doesn't change any of the code -- it's ""edit"" is simply a no-op. Transformer helps users succinctly specify rules of this sort and easily execute; them locally over a collection of files, apply them to selected portions of; a codebase, or even bundle them as a clang-tidy check for ongoing application.

For example, parenthesis expressions and compile time; constants are available in an unreduced form in the AST. This makes; Clang's AST a good fit for refactoring tools.

The instructions in this document depend on libraries and programs external to; LLVM, there are many ways to install and configure these dependencies so you; may need to adapt the instructions here to fit your own local situation. Prerequisites; =============. In this use case we'll be using cmake on a Debian-based Linux system,; cross-compiling from an x86_64 host to a hard-float Armv7-A target. We'll be; using as many of the LLVM tools as we can, but it is possible to use GNU; equivalents. * ``A build of LLVM/clang for the llvm-tools and llvm-config``; * ``A clang executable with support for the ARM target``; * ``compiler-rt sources``; * ``The qemu-arm user mode emulator``; * ``An arm-linux-gnueabihf sysroot``.

Modifiability,"=================================; CodeView Type Records; =====================================. .. contents::; :local:. .. _types_intro:. Introduction; ============. This document describes the usage and serialization format of the various; CodeView type records that LLVM understands. This document does not describe; every single CodeView type record that is defined. In some cases, this is; because the records are clearly deprecated and can only appear in very old; software (e.g. the 16-bit types). On other cases, it is because the records; have never been observed in practice. This could be because they are only; generated for non-C++ code (e.g. Visual Basic, C#), or because they have been; made obsolete by newer records, or any number of other reasons. However, the; records we describe here should cover 99% of type records that one can expect; to encounter when dealing with modern C++ toolchains. Record Categories; =================. We can think of a sequence of CodeView type records as an array of variable length; `leaf records`. Each such record describes its own length as part of a fixed-size; header, as well as the kind of record it is. Leaf records are either padded to 4; bytes (if this type stream appears in a TPI/IPI stream of a PDB) or not padded at; all (if this type stream appears in the ``.debug$T`` section of an object file).; Padding is implemented by inserting a decreasing sequence of `<_padding_records>`; that terminates with ``LF_PAD0``. The final category of record is a ``member record``. One particular leaf type --; ``LF_FIELDLIST`` -- contains a series of embedded records. While the outer; ``LF_FIELDLIST`` describes its length (like any other leaf record), the embedded; records -- called ``member records`` do not. .. _leaf_types:. Leaf Records; ------------.

Modifiability,"==================================; Stack Safety Analysis; ==================================. Introduction; ============. The Stack Safety Analysis determines if stack allocated variables can be; considered 'safe' from memory access bugs. The primary purpose of the analysis is to be used by sanitizers to avoid; unnecessary instrumentation of 'safe' variables. SafeStack is going to be the; first user. 'safe' variables can be defined as variables that can not be used out-of-scope; (e.g. use-after-return) or accessed out of bounds. In the future it can be; extended to track other variable properties. E.g. we plan to extend; implementation with a check to make sure that variable is always initialized; before every read to optimize use-of-uninitialized-memory checks. How it works; ============. The analysis is implemented in two stages:. The intra-procedural, or 'local', stage performs a depth-first search inside; functions to collect all uses of each alloca, including loads/stores and uses as; arguments functions. After this stage we know which parts of the alloca are used; by functions itself but we don't know what happens after it is passed as; an argument to another function. The inter-procedural, or 'global', stage, resolves what happens to allocas after; they are passed as function arguments. This stage performs a depth-first search; on function calls inside a single module and propagates allocas usage through; functions calls. When used with ThinLTO, the global stage performs a whole program analysis over; the Module Summary Index. Testing; =======. The analysis is covered with lit tests. We expect that users can tolerate false classification of variables as; 'unsafe' when in-fact it's 'safe'. This may lead to inefficient code. However, we; can't accept false 'safe' classification which may cause sanitizers to miss actual; bugs in instrumented code. To avoid that we want additional validation tool.

Modifiability,"===================================; How To Setup Clang Tooling For LLVM; ===================================. Clang Tooling provides infrastructure to write tools that need syntactic; and semantic information about a program. This term also relates to a set; of specific tools using this infrastructure (e.g. ``clang-check``). This; document provides information on how to set up and use Clang Tooling for; the LLVM source code. Introduction; ============. Clang Tooling needs a compilation database to figure out specific build; options for each file. Currently it can create a compilation database; from the ``compile_commands.json`` file, generated by CMake. When; invoking clang tools, you can either specify a path to a build directory; using a command line parameter ``-p`` or let Clang Tooling find this; file in your source tree. In either case you need to configure your; build using CMake to use clang tools. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake and Make; ========================================. If you intend to use make to build LLVM, you should have CMake 2.8.6 or; later installed (can be found `here <https://cmake.org>`_). First, you need to generate Makefiles for LLVM with CMake. You need to; make a build directory and run CMake from it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/.

If you know; what a section, symbol, and relocation are you should find this document; accessible. If it is not, please submit a patch (:doc:`Contributing`) or file a; bug (:doc:`HowToSubmitABug`). JITLink is a library for :ref:`jit_linking`. It was built to support the :doc:`ORC JIT; APIs<ORCv2>` and is most commonly accessed via ORC's ObjectLinkingLayer API. JITLink was; developed with the aim of supporting the full set of features provided by each; object format; including static initializers, exception handling, thread local; variables, and language runtime registration. Supporting these features enables; ORC to execute code generated from source languages which rely on these features; (e.g. C++ requires object format support for static initializers to support; static constructors, eh-frame registration for exceptions, and TLV support for; thread locals; Swift and Objective-C require language runtime registration for; many features). For some object format features support is provided entirely; within JITLink, and for others it is provided in cooperation with the; (prototype) ORC runtime. JITLink aims to support the following features, some of which are still under; development:. 1. Cross-process and cross-architecture linking of single relocatable objects; into a target *executor* process. 2. Support for all object format features. 3.

Modifiability,"=====================================. Writing a new alias analysis implementation for LLVM is quite straight-forward.; There are already several implementations that you can use for examples, and the; following information should help fill in any details. For examples, take a; look at the `various alias analysis implementations`_ included with LLVM. Different Pass styles; ---------------------. The first step to determining what type of :doc:`LLVM pass <WritingAnLLVMPass>`; you need to use for your Alias Analysis. As is the case with most other; analyses and transformations, the answer should be fairly obvious from what type; of problem you are trying to solve:. #. If you require interprocedural analysis, it should be a ``Pass``.; #. If you are a function-local analysis, subclass ``FunctionPass``.; #. If you don't need to look at the program at all, subclass ``ImmutablePass``. In addition to the pass that you subclass, you should also inherit from the; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface, of course, and use the ``RegisterAnalysisGroup``; template to register as an implementation of ``AliasAnalysis``. Required initialization calls; -----------------------------. Your subclass of ``AliasAnalysis`` is required to invoke two methods on the; ``AliasAnalysis`` base class: ``getAnalysisUsage`` and; ``InitializeAliasAnalysis``. In particular, your implementation of; ``getAnalysisUsage`` should explicitly call into the; ``AliasAnalysis::getAnalysisUsage`` method in addition to doing any declaring; any pass dependencies your pass has. Thus you should have something like this:. .. code-block:: c++. void getAnalysisUsage(AnalysisUsage &AU) const {; AliasAnalysis::getAnalysisUsage(AU);; // declare your dependencies here.; }. Additionally, your must invoke the ``InitializeAliasAnalysis`` method from your; analysis run method (``run`` for a ``Pass``, ``runOnFunction`` for a; ``FunctionPass``, or ``InitializePass`` for an ``ImmutablePass``).

This document covers how to integrate LLVM into a compiler for a language which; supports garbage collection. **Note that LLVM itself does not provide a; garbage collector.** You must provide your own. Quick Start; ============. First, you should pick a collector strategy. LLVM includes a number of built; in ones, but you can also implement a loadable plugin with a custom definition.; Note that the collector strategy is a description of how LLVM should generate; code such that it interacts with your collector and runtime, not a description; of the collector itself. Next, mark your generated functions as using your chosen collector strategy.; From c++, you can call:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(<collector description name>);. This will produce IR like the following fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() gc ""<collector description name>"" { ... }. When generating LLVM IR for your functions, you will need to:. * Use ``@llvm.gcread`` and/or ``@llvm.gcwrite`` in place of standard load and; store instructions. These intrinsics are used to represent load and store; barriers. If you collector does not require such barriers, you can skip; this step. * Use the memory allocation routines provided by your garbage collector's; runtime library. * If your collector requires them, generate type maps according to your; runtime's binary interface. LLVM is not involved in the process. In; particular, the LLVM type system is not suitable for conveying such; information though the compiler. * Insert any coordination code required for interacting with your collector.; Many collectors require running application code to periodically check a; flag and conditionally call a runtime function. This is often referred to; as a safepoint poll.

Welcome to Chapter 5 of the ""`Implementing a language with; LLVM <index.html>`_"" tutorial. Parts 1-4 described the implementation of; the simple Kaleidoscope language and included support for generating; LLVM IR, followed by optimizations and a JIT compiler. Unfortunately, as; presented, Kaleidoscope is mostly useless: it has no control flow other; than call and return. This means that you can't have conditional; branches in the code, significantly limiting its power. In this episode; of ""build that compiler"", we'll extend Kaleidoscope to have an; if/then/else expression plus a simple 'for' loop. If/Then/Else; ============. Extending Kaleidoscope to support if/then/else is quite straightforward.; It basically requires adding support for this ""new"" concept to the; lexer, parser, AST, and LLVM code emitter. This example is nice, because; it shows how easy it is to ""grow"" a language over time, incrementally; extending it as new ideas are discovered. Before we get going on ""how"" we add this extension, let's talk about; ""what"" we want. The basic idea is that we want to be able to write this; sort of thing:. ::. def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. In Kaleidoscope, every construct is an expression: there are no; statements. As such, the if/then/else expression needs to return a value; like any other. Since we're using a mostly functional form, we'll have; it evaluate its conditional, then return the 'then' or 'else' value; based on how the condition was resolved. This is very similar to the C; ""?:"" expression. The semantics of the if/then/else expression is that it evaluates the; condition to a boolean equality value: 0.0 is considered to be false and; everything else is considered to be true. If the condition is true, the; first subexpression is evaluated and returned, if the condition is; false, the second subexpression is evaluated and retu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl05.rst:1147,extend,extending,1147,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl05.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl05.rst,1,['extend'],['extending']

Chapter 9 Introduction; ======================. Welcome to Chapter 9 of the ""`Implementing a language with; LLVM <index.html>`_"" tutorial. In chapters 1 through 8, we've built a; decent little programming language with functions and variables.; What happens if something goes wrong though, how do you debug your; program?. Source level debugging uses formatted data that helps a debugger; translate from binary and the state of the machine back to the; source that the programmer wrote. In LLVM we generally use a format; called `DWARF <http://dwarfstd.org>`_. DWARF is a compact encoding; that represents types, source locations, and variable locations. The short summary of this chapter is that we'll go through the; various things you have to add to a programming language to; support debug info, and how you translate that into DWARF. Caveat: For now we can't debug via the JIT, so we'll need to compile; our program down to something small and standalone. As part of this; we'll make a few modifications to the running of the language and; how programs are compiled. This means that we'll have a source file; with a simple program written in Kaleidoscope rather than the; interactive JIT. It does involve a limitation that we can only; have one ""top level"" command at a time to reduce the number of; changes necessary. Here's the sample program we'll be compiling:. .. code-block:: python. def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. fib(10). Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. Debug information is a hard problem for a few different reasons - mostly; centered around optimized code. First, optimization makes keeping source; locations more difficult.

To run the test suite, you need to use the following steps:. #. Check out the ``test-suite`` module with:. .. code-block:: bash. % git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git test-suite. #. FIXME: these directions are outdated and won't work. Figure out; what the correct thing to do is, and write it down here. #. Configure and build ``llvm``. #. Configure and build ``llvm-gcc``. #. Install ``llvm-gcc`` somewhere. #. *Re-configure* ``llvm`` from the top level of each build tree (LLVM; object directory tree) in which you want to run the test suite, just; as you do before building LLVM. During the *re-configuration*, you must either: (1) have ``llvm-gcc``; you just built in your path, or (2) specify the directory where your; just-built ``llvm-gcc`` is installed using; ``--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR``. You must also tell the configure machinery that the test suite is; available so it can be configured for your build tree:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure [--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR].

Modifiability,"=======================================. Reading an object with RNTuple should be seen as _overwriting_ its persistent data members.; Given a properly constructed and valid object, the object must ensure that it stays valid when overwriting its persistent data members.; However, the object should not rely on its transient state to remain unchanged during reading:; it may be destructed and constructed again when it is read as part of a collection (see below). An object that is being read from disk may have been constructed by `RField::CreateValue()`.; In this case, the deleter returned by `RField::GetDeleter()` releases the resources. When reading collections of type `T` (`std::vector<T>`, `ROOT::RVec<T>`, ...), RNTuple uses `RField::CreateValue()` to construct elements of the inner type `T`.; As the size of a collection changes from event to event, this has the following effect on its elements; - If the collection shrinks, cut-off elements are destructed; - If the collection grows, new elements are constructed before reading them; - If the array buffer of the collection is reallocated (may happen for both shrinking and growing depending on the collection), all elements are destructed first in the old buffer; and the new number of elements is constructed in the new buffer. So unless the collection buffer needs to be reallocated, RNTuple tries to avoid unnecessary destruction/construction but instead overwrites existing objects.; Note that RNTuple currently does not copy or move existing objects when the collection buffer is reallocated. Naming Conventions; ==================. For byte arrays and collections of things, the RNTuple code uses the following variable name suffixes:; - `XyzSize` denotes the size of Xyz in bytes on disk, i.e. after compression. Example: `fPageListSize`.; - `XyzLength` denotes the size of Xyz in bytes in memory, i.e. uncompressed. Example: `fPageListLength`.; - `NXyz` denotes the number of Xyz items in a collection.

In addition to defining global variables, the ``defvar`` statement can; be used inside the :token:`Body` of a class or record definition to define; local variables.

Our demonstration for Chapter 3 is elegant and easy to extend.; Unfortunately, it does not produce wonderful code.

This code is not a literal transcription of the AST built by parsing the; input.

Constant folding, as seen above, in particular, is a very common and; very important optimization: so much so that many language implementors; implement constant folding support in their AST representation. With LLVM, you don't need this support in the AST. Since all calls to; build LLVM IR go through the LLVM IR builder, the builder itself checked; to see if there was a constant folding opportunity when you call it.

As such,; all values are implicitly double precision and the language doesn't; require type declarations. This gives the language a very nice and; simple syntax. For example, the following simple example computes; `Fibonacci numbers: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>`_. ::. # Compute the x'th fibonacci number.; def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2). # This expression will compute the 40th number.; fib(40).

Modifiability,"============================================================; Extending LLVM: Adding instructions, intrinsics, types, etc.; ============================================================. Introduction and Warning; ========================. During the course of using LLVM, you may wish to customize it for your research; project or for experimentation. At this point, you may realize that you need to; add something to LLVM, whether it be a new fundamental type, a new intrinsic; function, or a whole new instruction. When you come to this realization, stop and think. Do you really need to extend; LLVM? Is it a new fundamental capability that LLVM does not support at its; current incarnation or can it be synthesized from already pre-existing LLVM; elements? If you are not sure, ask on the `LLVM forums; <https://discourse.llvm.org>`_. The reason is that; extending LLVM will get involved as you need to update all the different passes; that you intend to use with your extension, and there are ``many`` LLVM analyses; and transformations, so it may be quite a bit of work.

All builders; attached to this machine will notify commit authors every time they break; the build.; * The staging buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/staging>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will be completely silent by default when the build; is broken. This buildmaster is reconfigured every two hours with any new; commits from the llvm-zorg repository. In order to remain connected to the main buildmaster (and thus notify; developers of failures), a builbot must:. * Be building a supported configuration. Builders for experimental backends; should generally be attached to staging buildmaster.; * Be able to keep up with new commits to the main branch, or at a minimum; recover to tip of tree within a couple of days of falling behind. Additionally, we encourage all bot owners to point their bots towards the; staging master during maintenance windows, instability troubleshooting, and; such. Roles & Expectations; ====================. Each buildbot has an owner who is the responsible party for addressing problems; which arise with said buildbot. We generally expect the bot owner to be; reasonably responsive. For some bots, the ownership responsibility is split between a ""resource owner""; who provides the underlying machine resource, and a ""configuration owner"" who; maintains the build configuration.

The instructions in this document depend on libraries and programs external to; LLVM, there are many ways to install and configure these dependencies so you; may need to adapt the instructions here to fit your own local situation. Prerequisites; =============. In this use case we'll be using cmake on a Debian-based Linux system,; cross-compiling from an x86_64 host to a hard-float Armv7-A target.

Basic-mode specific; defaults can be provided in the ``XRAY_BASIC_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Flight Data Recorder Mode; -------------------------. XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a; fixed amount of memory's worth of events. Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode works; very much like a plane's ""black box"" which keeps recording data to memory in a; fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data available; programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed. To use FDR mode; on your application, you may set the ``xray_mode`` variable to ``xray-fdr`` in; the ``XRAY_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Additional options to the FDR mode; implementation can be provided in the ``XRAY_FDR_OPTIONS`` environment; variable. Programmatic configuration can be done by calling; ``__xray_log_init_mode(""xray-fdr"", <configuration string>)`` once it has been; selected/installed. When the buffers are flushed to disk, the result is a binary trace format; described by `XRay FDR format <XRayFDRFormat.html>`_. When FDR mode is on, it will keep writing and recycling memory buffers until; the logging implementation is finalized -- at which point it can be flushed and; re-initialised later. To do this programmatically, we follow the workflow; provided below:. .. code-block:: c++. // Patch the sleds, if we haven't yet.; auto patch_status = __xray_patch();. // Maybe handle the patch_status errors. // When we want to flush the log, we need to finalize it first, to give; // threads a chance to return buffers to the queue.; auto finalize_status = __xray_log_finalize();; if (finalize_status != XRAY_LOG_FINALIZED) {; // maybe retry, or bail out.; }. // At this point, w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst:9428,variab,variable,9428,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,1,['variab'],['variable']

Somehow, it has to know how many elements are in the; array to reserve enough space in the buffer and write out the; appropriate number of elements. This is done in the class definition.; For example:. ``` {.cpp}; class Event : public TObject {; private:; char fType[20];; Int_t fNtrack;; Int_t fNseg;; Int_t fNvertex;; ...; Float_t *fClosestDistance; //[fNvertex]; ```. The array `fClosestDistance` is defined as a pointer of floating point; numbers. A comment mark (//), and the number in square brackets tell the; `Streamer `the length of the array for this object. In general the; syntax is:. ``` {.cpp}; <simple type> *<name>//[<length>]; ```. The length cannot be an expression. If a variable is used, it needs to; be an integer data member of the class. It must be defined ahead of its; use, or in a base class. The same notation also applies to variable length array of object and; variable length array of pointer to objects. ``` {.cpp}; MyObject *obj; //[fNojbs]; MyObject **objs; //[fDatas]; ```. ### Double32\_t. Math operations very often require double precision, but on saving; single usually precision is sufficient. For this purpose we support the; typedef Double32\_t which is stored in memory as a double and on disk as; a float or integer. The actual size of disk (before compression) is; determined by the parameter next to the data member declaration. For; example:. ``` {.cpp}; Double32_t m_data; //[min,max<,nbits>]; ```. If the comment is absent or does not contain `min`, `max`,; `nbits`, the member is saved as a `float`. If `min` and `max` are present, they are saved with 32 bits precision.; `min` and `max` can be explicit values or expressions of values known; to Cling (e.g. `pi`). If `nbits` is present, the member is saved as `int` with `nbits` bits precision.

For example, to run the ``print-function-names`` plugin over a source file in; clang, first build the plugin, and then call clang with the plugin from the; source tree:. .. code-block:: console. $ export BD=/path/to/build/directory; $ (cd $BD && make PrintFunctionNames ); $ clang++ -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_DEBUG -D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS \; -D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS -D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS -D_GNU_SOURCE \; -I$BD/tools/clang/include -Itools/clang/include -I$BD/include -Iinclude \; tools/clang/tools/clang-check/ClangCheck.cpp -fsyntax-only \; -Xclang -load -Xclang $BD/lib/PrintFunctionNames.so -Xclang \; -plugin -Xclang print-fns.

First, follow the instructions for obtaining; and unpacking the source, and setting up the build environment. Then, use the following command to configure the build process (of; course, feel free to add any additional flags you may need):. `$ ./configure <arch> [--with-python-incdir=<dir>][--with-python-libdir=>dir>]`. For details on `<arch>` see the official build pages, the Python include; directory should point to the directory that contains `Python.h` and the; library directory should point to the directory containing; `libpythonx.y.so`, where '`x`' and '`y`' are the major and minor version; number, respectively. If you do not specify include and library; directories explicitly, the configuration process will try the; `PYTHONDIR` environment variable or, alternatively, the standard; locations. A recent distribution of Python is required: version 2.4.3 is preferred,; but the older 2.2.x and 2.3.x versions suffice and are supported as; well. Versions older than 2.2 are not supported and will not work. Note; that one problem with 2.2 is that the shared library of the `Python`; interpreter core is not build by default and the '--enable-shared' flag; should thus be used when building `Python` from source. If the `Python`; interpreter that is installed on your system is too old, please obtain a; new version from <http://www.python.org>.

This new default integrator has much improved stability and speed; for relatively smooth p.d.f.s in two or three dimensions and can; generally be used well for p.d.f. normalization integrals without; causing MINUIT converge problems due to numeric precision issues.

Modifiability,"?; ---------------------------. Garbage collection is a widely used technique that frees the programmer from; having to know the lifetimes of heap objects, making software easier to produce; and maintain. Many programming languages rely on garbage collection for; automatic memory management. There are two primary forms of garbage collection:; conservative and accurate. Conservative garbage collection often does not require any special support from; either the language or the compiler: it can handle non-type-safe programming; languages (such as C/C++) and does not require any special information from the; compiler. The `Boehm collector; <https://hboehm.info/gc/>`__ is an example of a; state-of-the-art conservative collector. Accurate garbage collection requires the ability to identify all pointers in the; program at run-time (which requires that the source-language be type-safe in; most cases). Identifying pointers at run-time requires compiler support to; locate all places that hold live pointer variables at run-time, including the; :ref:`processor stack and registers <gcroot>`. Conservative garbage collection is attractive because it does not require any; special compiler support, but it does have problems. In particular, because the; conservative garbage collector cannot *know* that a particular word in the; machine is a pointer, it cannot move live objects in the heap (preventing the; use of compacting and generational GC algorithms) and it can occasionally suffer; from memory leaks due to integer values that happen to point to objects in the; program. In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program.

Modifiability,"ABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line. Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory. This directory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these line",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:7845,flexible,flexible,7845,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['flexible'],['flexible']

Modifiability,"ALUE``; pseudo instruction can be used to annotate the linearized control flow. This can; be done by defining an artificial variable for the lane PC. The DWARF location; list expression created for it is used as the value of the; ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute on the subprogram's debugger information entry. A DWARF procedure is defined for each well nested structured control flow region; which provides the conceptual lane program location for a lane if it is not; active (namely it is divergent). The DWARF operation expression for each region; conceptually inherits the value of the immediately enclosing region and modifies; it according to the semantics of the region. For an ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` region the divergent program location is at the start of; the region for the ``THEN`` region since it is executed first. For the ``ELSE``; region the divergent program location is at the end of the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``; region since the ``THEN`` region has completed. The lane PC artificial variable is assigned at each region transition. It uses; the immediately enclosing region's DWARF procedure to compute the program; location for each lane assuming they are divergent, and then modifies the result; by inserting the current program location for each lane that the ``EXEC`` mask; indicates is active. By having separate DWARF procedures for each region, they can be reused to; define the value for any nested region. This reduces the total size of the DWARF; operation expressions.

See `indirectReturn` in; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and in; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for an; example. * In order to solve the first bullet-point we need to be able to specify that a; memory location is available without using a `DIAssignID`. This is because; the storage address is not computed by an instruction (it's an argument; value) and therefore we have nowhere to put the metadata attachment. To solve; this we probably need another marker intrinsic to denote ""the variable's; stack home is X address"" - similar to `llvm.dbg.declare` except that it needs; to compose with `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics such that the stack home address; is only selected as a location for the variable when",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md:10034,variab,variables,10034,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"By Chris:. LLVM has been designed with two primary goals in mind. First we strive to ; enable the best possible division of labor between static and dynamic ; compilers, and second, we need a flexible and powerful interface ; between these two complementary stages of compilation. We feel that ; providing a solution to these two goals will yield an excellent solution ; to the performance problem faced by modern architectures and programming ; languages. A key insight into current compiler and runtime systems is that a ; compiler may fall in anywhere in a ""continuum of compilation"" to do its ; job. On one side, scripting languages statically compile nothing and ; dynamically compile (or equivalently, interpret) everything. On the far ; other side, traditional static compilers process everything statically and ; nothing dynamically. These approaches have typically been seen as a ; tradeoff between performance and portability. On a deeper level, however, ; there are two reasons that optimal system performance may be obtained by a; system somewhere in between these two extremes: Dynamic application ; behavior and social constraints. From a technical perspective, pure static compilation cannot ever give ; optimal performance in all cases, because applications have varying dynamic; behavior that the static compiler cannot take into consideration. Even ; compilers that support profile guided optimization generate poor code in ; the real world, because using such optimization tunes that application ; to one particular usage pattern, whereas real programs (as opposed to ; benchmarks) often have several different usage patterns. On a social level, static compilation is a very shortsighted solution to ; the performance problem. Instruction set architectures (ISAs) continuously ; evolve, and each implementation of an ISA (a processor) must choose a set ; of tradeoffs that make sense in the market context that it is designed for. ; With every new processor introduced, the vendor f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt:192,flexible,flexible,192,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt,2,"['flexible', 'portab']","['flexible', 'portability']"
Modifiability,"C must be; run after SSA construction (i.e. mem2ref). RewriteStatepointsForGC will ensure that appropriate base pointers are listed; for every relocation created. It will do so by duplicating code as needed to; propagate the base pointer associated with each pointer being relocated to; the appropriate safepoints. The implementation assumes that the following; IR constructs produce base pointers: loads from the heap, addresses of global; variables, function arguments, function return values. Constant pointers (such; as null) are also assumed to be base pointers. In practice, this constraint; can be relaxed to producing interior derived pointers provided the target; collector can find the associated allocation from an arbitrary interior; derived pointer. By default RewriteStatepointsForGC passes in ``0xABCDEF00`` as the statepoint; ID and ``0`` as the number of patchable bytes to the newly constructed; ``gc.statepoint``. These values can be configured on a per-callsite; basis using the attributes ``""statepoint-id""`` and; ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""``. If a call site is marked with a; ``""statepoint-id""`` function attribute and its value is a positive; integer (represented as a string), then that value is used as the ID; of the newly constructed ``gc.statepoint``. If a call site is marked; with a ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""`` function attribute and its; value is a positive integer, then that value is used as the 'num patch; bytes' parameter of the newly constructed ``gc.statepoint``. The; ``""statepoint-id""`` and ``""statepoint-num-patch-bytes""`` attributes; are not propagated to the ``gc.statepoint`` call or invoke if they; could be successfully parsed. In practice, RewriteStatepointsForGC should be run much later in the pass; pipeline, after most optimization is already done.

In; general, the expression is:. ``` {.cpp}; Selection = ""weight *(boolean expression)""; ```. If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, the histogram is filled; with a weight.

One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2. Since Apache version 2.4 FastCGI is directly supported - there is no need to compile and install external modules any more.; One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```; ProxyPass ""/root.app/"" ""fcgi://localhost:9000/"" enablereuse=on; ```. More information can be found in [FastCGI proxy docu](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html).; After restarting apache server one should be able to open address: `http://apache_host_name/root.app/`.; There are many ways to configure user authentication in Apache. Example of digest auth for FastCGI server:. ```; <Location ""/root.app/"">; AuthType Digest; AuthName ""root""; AuthDigestDomain ""/root.app/"" ""root""; AuthDigestProvider file; AuthUserFile ""/srv/auth/auth.txt""; Require valid-user; </Location>; ```. ### Configure fastcgi with lighttpd.

Modifiability,"CMake modules that contain definitions for useful functionality. The example below is the full CMake build for building a C++ ""Hello World""; program. The example uses only CMake language-defined functions. .. code-block:: cmake. cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0); project(HelloWorld); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp). The CMake language provides control flow constructs in the form of foreach loops; and if blocks. To make the example above more complicated you could add an if; block to define ""APPLE"" when targeting Apple platforms:. .. code-block:: cmake. cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0); project(HelloWorld); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp); if(APPLE); target_compile_definitions(HelloWorld PUBLIC APPLE); endif(). Variables, Types, and Scope; ===========================. Dereferencing; -------------. In CMake variables are ""stringly"" typed. All variables are represented as; strings throughout evaluation. Wrapping a variable in ``${}`` dereferences it; and results in a literal substitution of the name for the value. CMake refers to; this as ""variable evaluation"" in their documentation. Dereferences are performed; *before* the command being called receives the arguments. This means; dereferencing a list results in multiple separate arguments being passed to the; command. Variable dereferences can be nested and be used to model complex data. For; example:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(var_name var1); set(${var_name} foo) # same as ""set(var1 foo)""; set(${${var_name}}_var bar) # same as ""set(foo_var bar)"". Dereferencing an unset variable results in an empty expansion. It is a common; pattern in CMake to conditionally set variables knowing that it will be used in; code paths that the variable isn't set. There are examples of this throughout; the LLVM CMake build system. An example of variable empty expansion is:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(APPLE); set(extra_sources Apple.cpp); endif(); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp ${extra_sources}).

An ""idea"" can be a sketch of a development project, a functionality, a missing feature we would like to see in our tool.; A list that we propose is the following:. Ideas. Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on. Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/www/contribute.html:1309,Extend,Extending,1309,interpreter/cling/www/contribute.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/www/contribute.html,1,['Extend'],['Extending']

Next up; we'll add another useful expression that is familiar from non-functional; languages... 'for' Loop Expression; =====================. Now that we know how to add basic control flow constructs to the; language, we have the tools to add more powerful things. Let's add; something more aggressive, a 'for' expression:. ::. extern putchard(char);; def printstar(n); for i = 1, i < n, 1.0 in; putchard(42); # ascii 42 = '*'. # print 100 '*' characters; printstar(100);. This expression defines a new variable (""i"" in this case) which iterates; from a starting value, while the condition (""i < n"" in this case) is; true, incrementing by an optional step value (""1.0"" in this case). If; the step value is omitted, it defaults to 1.0. While the loop is true,; it executes its body expression. Because we don't have anything better; to return, we'll just define the loop as always returning 0.0. In the; future when we have mutable variables, it will get more useful.

Modifiability,"Cost `vs. `Age` for the entries where the nation is; equal to ""`FR`"". You can use any C++ operator, and some functions; defined in **`TFormula`**, in the selection parameter. The value of the; selection is used as a weight when filling the histogram. If the; expression includes only Boolean operations as in the example above, the; result is 0 or 1. If the result is 0, the histogram is not filled. In; general, the expression is:. ``` {.cpp}; Selection = ""weight *(boolean expression)""; ```. If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, the histogram is filled; with a weight. If the weight is not explicitly specified it is assumed; to be 1. For example, this selection will add 1 to the histogram if x is less; than y and the square root of z is less than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""x<y && sqrt(z)>3.2""; ```. On the other hand, this selection will add `x+y` to the histogram if the; square root of z is larger than 3.2. ``` {.cpp}; ""(x+y)*(sqrt(z)>3.2)""; ```. The `Draw` method has its own parser, and it only looks in the current; tree for variables. This means that any variable used in the selection; must be defined in the tree. You cannot use an arbitrary global variable; in the `TTree::Draw` method. ### Using TCut Objects in TTree::Draw. The `TTree::Draw` method also accepts **`TCutG`** objects. A; **`TCut`** is a specialized string object used for **`TTree`**; selections. A **`TCut`** object has a name and a title. It does not have; any data members in addition to what it inherits from **`TNamed`**. It; only adds a set of operators to do logical string concatenation. For; example, assume:. ``` {.cpp}; TCut cut1 = ""x<1""; TCut cut2 = ""y>2""; ```. then. ``` {.cpp}; cut1 && cut2; //result is the string ""(x<1)&&(y>2)""; ```. Operators =, +=, +, \*, !, &&, || are overloaded, here are some; examples:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCut c1 = ""x < 1""; root[] TCut c2 = ""y < 0""; root[] TCut c3 = c1 && c2; root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 || ""x>0""); root[] MyTree.Draw(""x"", c1 && c2);",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:72328,variab,variables,72328,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability,"D and 3-D histograms. If **`TH1`**`::Sumw2()` has; been called before filling, the sum of squares is also stored. One can; increment a bin number directly by calling; **`TH1`**`::AddBinContent()`, replace the existing content via; **`TH1`**`::SetBinContent()` , and access the bin content of a given; bin via **`TH1`**`::GetBinContent()` . ``` {.cpp}; Double_t binContent = h->GetBinContent(bin);; ```. ### Automatic Re-binning Option. By default, the number of bins is computed using the range of the; axis. You can change this to re-bin automatically by setting the; automatic re-binning option:. ``` {.cpp}; h->SetBit(TH1::kCanRebin);; ```; \index{histogram!rebin}. Once this is set, the `Fill()` method will automatically extend the; axis range to accommodate the new value specified in the `Fill()`; argument. The used method is to double the bin size until the new; value fits in the range, merging bins two by two. The; **`TTree`**`::Draw()` method extensively uses this automatic binning; option when drawing histograms of variables in **`TTree`** with an; unknown range. The automatic binning option is supported for 1-D, 2-D; and 3-D histograms. During filling, some statistics parameters are; incremented to compute the mean value and root mean square with the; maximum precision. In case of histograms of type **`TH1C`**,; **`TH1S`**, **`TH2C`**, **`TH2S`**, **`TH3C`**, **`TH3S`** a check is; made that the bin contents do not exceed the maximum positive capacity; (127 or 65 535). Histograms of all types may have positive or/and; negative bin contents. ## Random Numbers and Histograms. **`TH1`**`::FillRandom()` can be used to randomly fill a histogram; using the contents of an existing **`TF1`** function or another; **`TH1`** histogram (for all dimensions). For example, the following; two statements create and fill a histogram 10 000 times with a default; Gaussian distribution of `mean` `0` and `sigma` `1` :. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1F h1(""h1"",""Histo from a Gaussian"",100,-3,3);; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md:8709,variab,variables,8709,documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"DISCOVERY; --------------. The inputs passed to :program:`lit` can be either individual tests, or entire; directories or hierarchies of tests to run. When :program:`lit` starts up, the; first thing it does is convert the inputs into a complete list of tests to run; as part of *test discovery*. In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test suite*.; :program:`lit` resolves the inputs specified on the command line to test suites; by searching upwards from the input path until it finds a :file:`lit.cfg` or; :file:`lit.site.cfg` file. These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted. In addition, :program:`lit` always identifies tests by the test; suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite. For; appropriately configured projects, this allows :program:`lit` to provide; convenient and flexible support for out-of-tree builds. .. _test-status-results:.

Other architectures may have; other such instructions. What I was going to suggest was that for a particular processor, we define; additional VM instructions that match some of the unusual opcodes on the; processor but have VM semantics otherwise, i.e., all operands are in SSA; form and typed. This means that we can re-generate core VM code from the; more specialized code any time we want (so that portability is not lost). Typically, a static compiler like gcc would generate just the core VM, which; is relatively portable. Anyone (an offline tool, the linker, etc., or even; the static compiler itself if it chooses) can transform that into more; specialized target-specific VM code for a particular architecture. If the; linker does it, it can do it after all machine-independent optimizations.; This would be the most convenient, but not necessary. The main benefit of lowering will be that we will be able to retain a close; mapping between VM and machine code. --Vikram.

How do we get more high-level information into the VM while keeping; to a low-level VM design?. o Explicit array references as operands?

Instead, we can do the following (eventually): ; * Java bytecode is used as our ""safe"" representation (to avoid; reinventing something that we don't add much value to). When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key.

The histogram has to be in the same; directory as the tree. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TH1 *h1 = new TH1(""h1"",""h1"",50,0.,150.);; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack>> h1"");; ```. When you project a **`TTree`** into a histogram, the histogram inherits; the **`TTree`** attributes and not the current style attributes. This; allows you to project two Trees with different attributes into the same; picture. You can call the method `TTree::UseCurrentStyle` to change the; histogram to use the current style ***`gStyle`***. See ""Graphics and the; Graphical User Interface. The binning of the newly created histogram can be specified in two ways.; You can set a default in the `.rootrc` and/or you can add the binning; information in the `TTree::Draw` command. To set number of bins default for the 1-D, 2-D, 3-D histograms can be; specified in the `.rootrc` file via the environment variables, e.g.:. ```; # default binnings Hist.Binning.1D.x: 100. Hist.Binning.2D.x: 40; Hist.Binning.2D.y: 40; Hist.Binning.2D.Prof: 100. Hist.Binning.3D.x: 20; Hist.Binning.3D.y: 20; Hist.Binning.3D.z: 20; Hist.Binning.3D.Profx: 100; Hist.Binning.3D.Profy: 100; ```.

To do this, you'll want to pass; the following additional arguments to CMake. - ``-DLLVM_PROFDATA_FILE=/path/to/output/profdata.prof`` - Use the PGO; profile from the previous step.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above.

You now have a Clang built with profile-guided optimizations, and you; can delete all but the final build directory if you'd like. If this worked well for you and you plan on doing it often, there's a slight; optimization that can be made: LLVM and Clang have a tool called tblgen that's; built and run during the build process.

Modifiability,"Error reading body, remove function.; TheFunction->eraseFromParent();; return nullptr;; }. The only piece left here is handling of the error case. For simplicity,; we handle this by merely deleting the function we produced with the; ``eraseFromParent`` method. This allows the user to redefine a function; that they incorrectly typed in before: if we didn't delete it, it would; live in the symbol table, with a body, preventing future redefinition. This code does have a bug, though: If the ``FunctionAST::codegen()`` method; finds an existing IR Function, it does not validate its signature against the; definition's own prototype. This means that an earlier 'extern' declaration will; take precedence over the function definition's signature, which can cause; codegen to fail, for instance if the function arguments are named differently.; There are a number of ways to fix this bug, see what you can come up with! Here; is a testcase:. ::. extern foo(a); # ok, defines foo.; def foo(b) b; # Error: Unknown variable name. (decl using 'a' takes precedence). Driver Changes and Closing Thoughts; ===================================. For now, code generation to LLVM doesn't really get us much, except that; we can look at the pretty IR calls. The sample code inserts calls to; codegen into the ""``HandleDefinition``"", ""``HandleExtern``"" etc; functions, and then dumps out the LLVM IR. This gives a nice way to look; at the LLVM IR for simple functions. For example:. ::. ready> 4+5;; Read top-level expression:; define double @0() {; entry:; ret double 9.000000e+00; }. Note how the parser turns the top-level expression into anonymous; functions for us. This will be handy when we add `JIT; support <LangImpl04.html#adding-a-jit-compiler>`_ in the next chapter.

If no definition is; found inside the JIT, it falls back to calling ""``dlsym(""sin"")``"" on the; Kaleidoscope process itself. Since ""``sin``"" is defined within the JIT's; address space, it simply patches up calls in the module to call the libm; version of ``sin`` directly. But in some cases this even goes further:; as sin and cos are names of standard math functions, the constant folder; will directly evaluate the function calls to the correct result when called; with constants like in the ""``sin(1.0)``"" above. In the future we'll see how tweaking this symbol resolution rule can be used to; enable all sorts of useful features, from security (restricting the set of; symbols available to JIT'd code), to dynamic code generation based on symbol; names, and even lazy compilation. One immediate benefit of the symbol resolution rule is that we can now extend; the language by writing arbitrary C++ code to implement operations.

Note, that for Windows we need to actually export the functions because; the dynamic symbol loader will use ``GetProcAddress`` to find the symbols. Now we can produce simple output to the console by using things like:; ""``extern putchard(x); putchard(120);``"", which prints a lowercase 'x'; on the console (120 is the ASCII code for 'x'). Similar code could be; used to implement file I/O, console input, and many other capabilities; in Kaleidoscope. This completes the JIT and optimizer chapter of the Kaleidoscope; tutorial.

Modifiability,"Force floating-point operations to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode by default. The result of a floating-point operation often cannot be exactly represented in the result type and therefore must be rounded. IEEE 754 describes different rounding modes that control how to perform this rounding, not all of which are supported by all implementations. C provides interfaces (``fesetround`` and ``fesetenv``) for dynamically controlling the rounding mode, and while it also recommends certain conventions for changing the rounding mode, these conventions are not typically enforced in the ABI. Since the rounding mode changes the numerical result of operations, the compiler must understand something about it in order to optimize floating point operations. Note that floating-point operations performed as part of constant initialization are formally performed prior to the start of the program and are therefore not subject to the current rounding mode. This includes the initialization of global variables and local ``static`` variables. Floating-point operations in these contexts will be rounded using ``FE_TONEAREST``. - The option ``-fno-rounding-math`` allows the compiler to assume that the rounding mode is set to ``FE_TONEAREST``. This is the default.; - The option ``-frounding-math`` forces the compiler to honor the dynamically-set rounding mode. This prevents optimizations which might affect results if the rounding mode changes or is different from the default; for example, it prevents floating-point operations from being reordered across most calls and prevents constant-folding when the result is not exactly representable. .. option:: -ffp-model=<value>.

Modifiability,"GOAL:. Provide http interface to arbitrary ROOT application. USAGE:. At any place of the code create http server:. root [0] serv = new THttpServer. By default, civetweb web server with port number 8080 will be started.; It gets access to files, canvases and trees, registered in gROOT.; One additionally could register other objects to the server:. root [1] serv->Register(""abc/fold1"", hpx);; root [2] serv->Register(""abc/fold2"", hpxpy);; root [3] serv->Register(""extra"", c1);. Once server running, just open in any browser page: http://yourhost:8080. Example macro: $ROOTSYS/tutorials/http/httpserver.C. FAST CGI:. Instead of running http server, one could use fast cgi interface; to normal web server like Apache or lighttpd or any other.; When creating server, one could specify:. root [0] serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");. This opens port 9000, which should be specified in web server configuration.; For instance, lighttpd.conf file could contain path like this:. fastcgi.server = (; ""/remote_scripts/"" =>; (( ""host"" => ""192.168.1.10"",; ""port"" => 9000,; ""check-local"" => ""disable"",; ""docroot"" => ""/""; )); ). In this case one should be able to access root application via address. http://your_lighttpd_host/remote_scripts/root.cgi/. AUTHOR:. Sergey Linev, S.Linev@gsi.de. CHANGES:.

Modifiability,"H` for finding the; headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance the injection of; `$ROOTSYS/test` in `test/stressMathCore.cxx`, allowing ROOT to find the header at runtime, whether interpreted; (`R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`) or compiled (`TROOT::AddExtraInterpreterArgs({""-I...""})` before interpreter construction). If you called `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` then update that; call to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict Header1.h OPTIONS -I subdir LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually included as; `#include ""Header1.h""`, or to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually; included as `#include ""subdir/Header1.h""`. I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or; `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed. As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to; be found at configuration time. We have seen too many cases where the header location was mis-stated, and as a consequence,; CMake did not generate the proper dependencies. If the header should not be taken into account for dependencies and / or if; the header will not be found (e.g. the standard library's `vector`) please pass the header through the `NODEPHEADERS` option; to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` or `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

Modifiability,"Hello""' of type 'string'; let a=""Hello"";; ^. Above, the member `a` was defined but with a type of `int`. We therefore cannot `let` it have a value of type `string`. ```tablegen; class C {; int a = 9;; }; def X: C {; let b=5;; }; ```. <stdin>:5:11: error: Value 'b' unknown!; let b=5;; ^. Above, class `C` only has one member, `a`. Therefore we get an error trying to override the value of `b` which doesn't exist. If you have multiple let, the outer scope is applied first then on down to the narrowest scope. ```tablegen; class Base {; int var=4;; }; let var=5 in {; def X: Base {}; let var=6 in {; def Y: Base {}; }; def Z: Base { let var=7; }; }; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class Base {; int var = 4;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def X {	// Base; int var = 5;; }; def Y {	// Base; int var = 6;; }; def Z {	// Base; int var = 7;; }. The first `let` is at what we call the ""top level"". That means the outer most scope in terms of the source code. A bit like a global variable in a C file. This is applied first and changes `var` from `4` to `5` for all classes within that `let` (`4` came from the definition of `Base`). def `X` is within the global `let`, therefore `var` is `5` within `X`. Then we have a `let` inside the global `let`. This one changes `var` from `5` to `6`. The scope of the `let` only contains the def `Y` therefore within `Y`, `var` is `6`. Finally def `Z` is within the global `let`, so `var` starts as `5`. `Z` has an inner `let` that changes `var` to `7`. That example is quite complex just to demonstrate the feature. Let's look at something more practical. ```tablegen; class Register {; int size=4;; }; let size=8 in {; def X0: Register {}; // Repeats 30 times for X1...X31; }; def W0: Register {}; // Repeats 30 times for W1...W31; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class Register {; int size = 4;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def W0 {	// Register; int size = 4;; }; def X0 {	// Register; int size = 8;; }.

Modifiability,"How to build it; ===============. You need to have gold with plugin support and build the LLVMgold plugin.; The gold linker is installed as ld.gold. To see whether gold is the default; on your system, run ``/usr/bin/ld -v``. It will report ""GNU; gold"" or else ""GNU ld"" if not. If gold is already installed at; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold``, one option is to simply make that the default by; backing up your existing ``/usr/bin/ld`` and creating a symbolic link; with ``ln -s /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld``. Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support. If not, and you get an error such as ""unknown option"",; then you will either need to build gold or install a version with plugin; support. * Download, configure and build gold with plugin support:. .. code-block:: bash. $ git clone --depth 1 git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils; $ mkdir build; $ cd build; $ ../binutils/configure --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werror; $ make all-gold. That should leave you with ``build/gold/ld-new`` which supports; the ``-plugin`` option. Running ``make`` will additionally build; ``build/binutils/ar`` and ``nm-new`` binaries supporting plugins. Once you're ready to switch to using gold, backup your existing; ``/usr/bin/ld`` then replace it with ``ld-new``. Alternatively, install; in ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` and use ``-fuse-ld=gold`` as described earlier. Optionally, add ``--enable-gold=default`` to the above configure invocation; to automatically install the newly built gold as the default linker with; ``make install``. * Build the LLVMgold plugin.

Each frame on the stack has an assigned EH; personality routine, which decides what actions to take to handle the exception.; There are a few major personalities for C and C++ code: the C++ personality; (``__CxxFrameHandler3``) and the SEH personalities (``_except_handler3``,; ``_except_handler4``, and ``__C_specific_handler``). All of them implement; cleanups by calling back into a ""funclet"" contained in the parent function. Funclets, in this context, are regions of the parent function that can be called; as though they were a function pointer with a very special calling convention.; The frame pointer of the parent frame is passed into the funclet either using; the standard EBP register or as the first parameter register, depending on the; architecture. The funclet implements the EH action by accessing local variables; in memory through the frame pointer, and returning some appropriate value,; continuing the EH process. No variables live in to or out of the funclet can be; allocated in registers. The C++ personality also uses funclets to contain the code for catch blocks; (i.e. all user code between the braces in ``catch (Type obj) { ... }``). The; runtime must use funclets for catch bodies because the C++ exception object is; allocated in a child stack frame of the function handling the exception. If the; runtime rewound the stack back to frame of the catch, the memory holding the; exception would be overwritten quickly by subsequent function calls. The use of; funclets also allows ``__CxxFrameHandler3`` to implement rethrow without; resorting to TLS. Instead, the runtime throws a special exception, and then uses; SEH (``__try / __except``) to resume execution with new information in the child; frame. In other words, the successive unwinding approach is incompatible with Visual; C++ exceptions and general purpose Windows exception handling.

Modifiability,"LVM emits stack map data into the object code within a designated; :ref:`stackmap-section`. This stack map data contains a record for; each stack map. The record stores the stack map's instruction address; and contains an entry for each mapped value. Each entry encodes a; value's location as a register, stack offset, or constant. A patch point is an instruction address at which space is reserved for; patching a new instruction sequence at run time. Patch points look; much like calls to LLVM. They take arguments that follow a calling; convention and may return a value. They also imply stack map; generation, which allows the runtime to locate the patchpoint and; find the location of ``live values`` at that point. Motivation; ==========. This functionality is currently experimental but is potentially useful; in a variety of settings, the most obvious being a runtime (JIT); compiler. Example applications of the patchpoint intrinsics are; implementing an inline call cache for polymorphic method dispatch or; optimizing the retrieval of properties in dynamically typed languages; such as JavaScript. The intrinsics documented here are currently used by the JavaScript; compiler within the open source WebKit project, see the `FTL JIT; <https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT>`_, but they are designed to be; used whenever stack maps or code patching are needed. Because the; intrinsics have experimental status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed. The stack map functionality described in this document is separate; from the functionality described in; :ref:`stack-map`. `GCFunctionMetadata` provides the location of; pointers into a collected heap captured by the `GCRoot` intrinsic,; which can also be considered a ""stack map"".

For users of the clang driver interface, it is possible to temporarily restore; the old default using the ``-DCLANG_ENABLE_OPAQUE_POINTERS=OFF`` cmake option,; or by passing ``-Xclang -no-opaque-pointers`` to a single clang invocation. For users of the clang cc1 interface, ``-no-opaque-pointers`` can be passed.; Note that the ``CLANG_ENABLE_OPAQUE_POINTERS`` cmake option has no effect on; the cc1 interface.

Several compilers will print a warning for the code above. It can be suppressed; by adding parentheses:. .. code-block:: c++. if ((V = getValue())) {; ...; }. Write Portable Code; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In almost all cases, it is possible to write completely portable code. When; you need to rely on non-portable code, put it behind a well-defined and; well-documented interface. Do not use RTTI or Exceptions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In an effort to reduce code and executable size, LLVM does not use exceptions; or RTTI (`runtime type information; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information>`_, for example,; ``dynamic_cast<>``). That said, LLVM does make extensive use of a hand-rolled form of RTTI that use; templates like :ref:`isa\<>, cast\<>, and dyn_cast\<> <isa>`.; This form of RTTI is opt-in and can be; :doc:`added to any class <HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI>`. Prefer C++-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When casting, use ``static_cast``, ``reinterpret_cast``, and ``const_cast``,; rather than C-style casts. There are two exceptions to this:. * When casting to ``void`` to suppress warnings about unused variables (as an; alternative to ``[[maybe_unused]]``). Prefer C-style casts in this instance. * Whe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:22070,portab,portable,22070,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['portab'],['portable']

On the other hand,; when the problem is very non-linear (i.e., $\mbox{FCN}$ is far from; a quadratic function of its parameters), is precisely the situation when; $\mbox{MINOS}$ is needed in order to indicate the correct parameter; errors. ### $\mbox{CONTOURS}$ plotting ###. M offers a procedure for finding $\mbox{FCN}$ $\mbox{CONTOURS}$; (provided via the class MnContours, see [api:contours]). The contour calculated by MnContours::operator() is dynamic, in the; sense that it represents the minimum of $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to; all the other $\mbox{npar - 2}$ parameters (if any). In statistical; terms, this means that MnContours takes account of the correlations; between the two parameters being plotted, and all the other variable; parameters, using a procedure analogous to that of $\mbox{MINOS}$.; (If this feature is not wanted, then the other parameters must be fixed; before calling $\mbox{CONTOURS}$.) MnContours provides the actual; coordinates of the points around the contour, suitable for plotting with; a graphics routine or by hand (using MnPlot, see [api:plot]). The points; are given in counter-clockwise order around the contour. Only one; contour is calculated per command, and the level is; $\displaystyle F_{\mathrm{min}} + \mbox{up}$. where $\mbox{up}$; is the return value of FCNBase::up() specified by the user (usually 1.0; by default). The number of points to be calculated is chosen by the user; (default is 20).

Modifiability,"Macro with ACLiC. ACLiC will create for you a compiled dynamic library for your macro,; without any effort from your side, except the insertion of the; appropriate header files in lines *5--11*.

Once this operation is accomplished, the macro symbols will be available; in memory and you will be able to execute it simply by calling from; inside the interpreter:. ``` {.cpp}; root [2] macro1(); ```. ### Compile a Macro with the Compiler. A plethora of excellent compilers are available, both free and; commercial. We will refer to the `GCC` compiler in the following. In; this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and; then exploit the *root-config* tool for the automatic settings of all; the compiler flags. *root-config* is a script that comes with ROOT; it; prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with; the ROOT libraries.

The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into; a stand-alone application is to add the following ""dressing code"" at the; end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose; of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}; int main() {; ExampleMacro();; return 0;; }; ```.

Modifiability,"Make script files. They can contain code to execute on include as well as; definitions for commands. In CMake macros and functions are universally referred to as commands, and they; are the primary method of defining code that can be called multiple times. In LLVM we have several CMake modules that are included as part of our; distribution for developers who don't build our project from source. Those; modules are the fundamental pieces needed to build LLVM-based projects with; CMake. We also rely on modules as a way of organizing the build system's; functionality for maintainability and re-use within LLVM projects. Argument Handling; -----------------. When defining a CMake command handling arguments is very useful. The examples; in this section will all use the CMake ``function`` block, but this all applies; to the ``macro`` block as well. CMake commands can have named arguments that are required at every call site. In; addition, all commands will implicitly accept a variable number of extra; arguments (In C parlance, all commands are varargs functions). When a command is; invoked with extra arguments (beyond the named ones) CMake will store the full; list of arguments (both named and unnamed) in a list named ``ARGV``, and the; sublist of unnamed arguments in ``ARGN``. Below is a trivial example of; providing a wrapper function for CMake's built in function ``add_dependencies``. .. code-block:: cmake. function(add_deps target); add_dependencies(${target} ${ARGN}); endfunction(). This example defines a new macro named ``add_deps`` which takes a required first; argument, and just calls another function passing through the first argument and; all trailing arguments. CMake provides a module ``CMakeParseArguments`` which provides an implementation; of advanced argument parsing. We use this all over LLVM, and it is recommended; for any function that has complex argument-based behaviors or optional; arguments.

Finally, there are three general categories of symbol record, grouped by where they are legal; to appear in a PDB file.

Modifiability,"MemoryManagerAllocateDataSectionCallback()``. When LLVM creates; this section, it invokes the callback and passes the section name.

For MachO (e.g. on Darwin), the stack map section name is; ""__llvm_stackmaps"". The segment name is ""__LLVM_STACKMAPS"". For ELF (e.g. on Linux), the stack map section name is; "".llvm_stackmaps"". The segment name is ""__LLVM_STACKMAPS"". Stack Map Usage; ===============. The stack map support described in this document can be used to; precisely determine the location of values at a specific position in; the code. LLVM does not maintain any mapping between those values and; any higher-level entity. The runtime must be able to interpret the; stack map record given only the ID, offset, and the order of the; locations, records, and functions, which LLVM preserves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe.

The application program can be run in two modes: it can be simply; interpreted by CLING or compiled. The first method is simpler but; results in slower execution. The second method employs ACLiC -; The Automatic Compiler of Libraries, which automatizes the; process of compilation and linking. In $(ROOTSYS)/tutorials there are 3 demonstration programs:. #### foam_kanwa.C; is a simple example how to run FOAM in interactive; mode. To run this macro issue the following simple command from the; Linux shell:. ```; root foam_kanwa.C; ```. or from CLING:. ```; root [0] .x foam_kanwa.C; ```. Simulation will start and graphical canvas with plot; of the distribution function appear. In this example; we defined the distribution function simply as a global; function function Camel2. #### foam_demo.C; shows usage of FOAM in compiled mode, which is; the preferred method. The integrand function is defined; now as a Density method from class TFDISTR inheriting from; abstract class TFoamIntegrand. User can modify interface to; integrand function according to their needs but they should; always remember to define Density method which provides the; density distribution.; Enter CLING interpreter and type:. ```; root [0] gSystem->Load(""libFoam.so""); root [1] .x foam_demo.C+; ```. to load FOAM library, compile and execute macro foam_demo.C.; A shared object foam_demo_C.so is created in the current; directory. At the end of exploration phase FOAM object; including distribution function will be written to disk. #### foam_demopers.C; demonstrates persistency of FOAM classes.; To run this macro type:. ```; root [0] .x foam_demopers.C; ```. Program reads the FOAM object from disk, checks its; consistency and prints geometry of cells. Next starts the; the generation. It can be interpreted directly by CLING; because compiled TFDISTR class is already available in; `foam_demo_C.so` library. @}",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tutorials/foam/index.md:1510,inherit,inheriting,1510,tutorials/foam/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tutorials/foam/index.md,1,['inherit'],['inheriting']

See ""The Role of TObject"". **`TObject`** provides protocol, i.e. (abstract) member functions,; for:. - Object I/O (`Read()`, `Write())`. - Error handling (`Warning()`, `Error()`, `SysError()`, `Fatal())`. - Sorting (`IsSortable()`, `Compare()`, `IsEqual()`, `Hash())`. - Inspection (`Dump()`, `Inspect()`). - Printing (`Print())`. - Drawing (`Draw()`, `Paint()`, `ExecuteEvent())`. - Bit handling (`SetBit()`, `TestBit()`). - Memory allocation (operator` new and delete`, `IsOnHeap())`. - Access to meta information (`IsA()`, `InheritsFrom())`. - Object browsing (`Browse()`, `IsFolder())`. ## Global Variables. ROOT has a set of global variables that apply to the session. For; example,; ***`gDirectory`*** always holds the current directory, and; ***`gStyle`*** holds the current style. All global variables begin with ""*g*"" followed by a capital letter. ### gROOT. The single instance of **`TROOT`** is accessible via the global; ***`gROOT`*** and holds information relative to the current session.; By using the ***`gROOT`*** pointer, you get the access to every object; created in a ROOT program. The **`TROOT`** object has several lists; pointing to the main ROOT objects. During a ROOT session, the; ***`gROOT`*** keeps a series of collections to manage objects. They; can be accessed via ***`gROOT`***`::GetListOf...` methods. ``` {.cpp}; gROOT->GetListOfClasses(); gROOT->GetListOfColors(); gROOT->GetListOfTypes(); gROOT->GetListOfGlobals(); gROOT->GetListOfGlobalFunctions(); gROOT->GetListOfFiles(); gROOT->GetListOfMappedFiles(); gROOT->GetListOfSockets(); gROOT->GetListOfCanvases(); gROOT->GetListOfStyles(); gROOT->GetListOfFunctions(); gROOT->GetListOfSpecials(); gROOT->GetListOfGeometries(); gROOT->GetListOfBrowsers(); gROOT->GetListOfMessageHandlers(); ```.

Now that you've seen some of; the basics, I strongly encourage you to take the code and hack on it.; For example, try adding:. - **global variables** - While global variables have questionable value; in modern software engineering, they are often useful when putting; together quick little hacks like the Kaleidoscope compiler itself.; Fortunately, our current setup makes it very easy to add global; variables: just have value lookup check to see if an unresolved; variable is in the global variable symbol table before rejecting it.; To create a new global variable, make an instance of the LLVM; ``GlobalVariable`` class.; - **typed variables** - Kaleidoscope currently only supports variables; of type double.

Modifiability,"PPLE); target_compile_definitions(HelloWorld PUBLIC APPLE); endif(). Variables, Types, and Scope; ===========================. Dereferencing; -------------. In CMake variables are ""stringly"" typed. All variables are represented as; strings throughout evaluation. Wrapping a variable in ``${}`` dereferences it; and results in a literal substitution of the name for the value. CMake refers to; this as ""variable evaluation"" in their documentation. Dereferences are performed; *before* the command being called receives the arguments. This means; dereferencing a list results in multiple separate arguments being passed to the; command. Variable dereferences can be nested and be used to model complex data. For; example:. .. code-block:: cmake. set(var_name var1); set(${var_name} foo) # same as ""set(var1 foo)""; set(${${var_name}}_var bar) # same as ""set(foo_var bar)"". Dereferencing an unset variable results in an empty expansion. It is a common; pattern in CMake to conditionally set variables knowing that it will be used in; code paths that the variable isn't set. There are examples of this throughout; the LLVM CMake build system. An example of variable empty expansion is:. .. code-block:: cmake. if(APPLE); set(extra_sources Apple.cpp); endif(); add_executable(HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp ${extra_sources}). In this example the ``extra_sources`` variable is only defined if you're; targeting an Apple platform. For all other targets the ``extra_sources`` will be; evaluated as empty before add_executable is given its arguments. Lists; -----. In CMake lists are semi-colon delimited strings, and it is strongly advised that; you avoid using semi-colons in lists; it doesn't go smoothly.

The `GetEntry` and `GetEntries` methods are not; affected. Note, that in the `SetEventList` method, the **`TEventList`**; argument is internally transformed into a **`TEntryList`**, and this; operation, in case of a **`TChain`**, requires loading of all the tree; headers. In this example, we create a list with all entries with more; than 600 tracks and then set it so that the tree will use this list. To; reset the **`TTree`** to use all events use `SetEventList(0)` or; `SetEntryList(0)`. 1. Let's look at an example. First, open the file and draw the; `fNtrack`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root"");; root[] TTree *T = (TTree*)f->Get(""T"");; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack"");; ```. 2. Now, put the entries with over 600 tracks into a **`TEntryList`**; called `myList`. We get the list from the current directory and assign; it to a variable list. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Draw("">>myList"",""fNtrack > 600"",""entrylist"");; root[] TEntryList *list=(TEntryList*)gDirectory->Get(""myList"");; ```. 3. Instruct the tree **`T`** to use the new list and draw it again. Note; that this is exactly the same `Draw` command. The list limits the; entries. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->SetEntryList(list);; root[] T->Draw(""fNtrack"");; ```. You should now see a canvas similar to this one. ![](pictures/03000105.png). #### Operations on TEntryLists. If you have entry lists that were created using different cuts, you can; combine the lists to get a new list, with entries passing at least one; of the cuts. Example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] T->Draw("">>list1"",""fNtrack>600"",""entrylist"");; root[] TEntryList *list1 = (TEntryList*)gDirectory->Get(""list1"");; root[] T->Draw("">>list2"",""fNtrack<590"",""entrylist"");; root[] TEntryList *list2 = (TEntryList*)gDirectory->Get(""list2"");; root[] list1->Add(list2);; ```. `list1` now contains entries wit",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:111848,variab,variable,111848,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['variab'],['variable']

The string is expected to be of the form ; fileName:workspaceName:objectName and simplifies import of objects from other workspaces on file. The importFromFile; accepts all arguments accepted by the standard import() method.; Generic objects (inheriting from TObject) can now also be stored in the workspace under an alias name, rather; under their own name, which simplifies management of objects of types like TMatrixD that do not have a settable name. ws.import(matrix,""cov_matrix"") ;.

Let us first look how we create an object. When we create an object; by:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. We are creating an object on the stack. A FORTRAN programmer may be; familiar with the idea; it is not unlike a local variable in a; function or subroutine. Although there are still a few old timers who; do not know it, FORTRAN is under no obligation to save local variables; once the function or subroutine returns unless the SAVE statement is; used. If not then it is likely that FORTRAN will place them on the; stack and they will ""pop off"" when the RETURN statement is reached. To; give an object more permanence it has to be placed on the heap. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. The second line declares a pointer to `Quad` called `my_objptr`. From; the syntax point of view, this is just like all the other declarations; we have seen so far, i.e. this is a stack variable. The value of the; pointer is set equal to. ``` {.cpp}; new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. `new`, despite its looks, is an operator and creates an object or; variable of the type that comes next, `Quad` in this case, on the; heap. Just as with stack objects it has to be initialized by calling; its constructor. The syntax requires that the argument list follows the; type.

CMake Caches; ============. Recently LLVM and Clang have been adding some more complicated build system; features. Utilizing these new features often involves a complicated chain of; CMake variables passed on the command line. Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>. CMake cache scripts are processed in an isolated scope, only cached variables; remain set when the main configuration runs. CMake cached variables do not reset; variables that are already set unless the FORCE option is specified. A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C. For more information about some of the advanced build configurations supported; via Cache files see :doc:`AdvancedBuilds`. Executing the Tests; ===================. Testing is performed when the *check-all* target is built. For instance, if you are; using Makefiles, execute this command in the root of your build directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all.

If you experience unexpected problems related to the likelihood evaluation, you; can revert back to the old backend by passing `RooFit::EvalBackend(""legacy"")`; to `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()` or `RooAbsPdf::createNLL()`.

Added correct treatment of extended term in asymptotically correct method for uncertainty determination in the presence of weights.; This improvement will allow for extended unbinned maximum likelihood fits to use the asymptotically correct method when using the `RooFit::AsymptoticError()` command argument in [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#ab0721374836c343a710f5ff92a326ff5).; See also this [writeup on extended weighted fits](https://root.cern/files/extended_weighted_fits.pdf) that is also linked from the reference guide.; The [pull request](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14751) that introduced this feature might also be a good reference. ### Compile your code with memory safe interfaces. If you define the `ROOFIT_MEMORY_SAFE_INTERFACES` preprocessor macro, the; RooFit interface changes in a way such that memory leaks are avoided. The most prominent effect of this change is that many functions that used to; return an owning pointer (e.g., a pointer to an object that you need to; manually `delete`) are then returning a `std::unique_pt` for automatic memory; management. For example this code would not compile anymore, because there is the risk that; the caller forgets to `delete params`:; ```c++; RooArgSet * params = pdf.getParameters(nullptr);; ```; If you wrap such return values in a `std::unique_ptr`, then your code will; compile both with and without memory safe interfaces:; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:8125,extend,extended,8125,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['extend'],['extended']

Because of this, we're moving towards using `OSS Fuzz`_ more; instead. You can browse the `LLVM project issue list`_ for the bugs found by; `LLVM on OSS Fuzz`_.

Utilities for Writing Fuzzers; =============================. There are some utilities available for writing fuzzers in LLVM. Some helpers for handling the command line interface are available in; ``include/llvm/FuzzMutate/FuzzerCLI.h``, including functions to parse command; line options in a consistent way and to implement standalone main functions so; your fuzzer can be built and tested when not built against libFuzzer. There is also some handling of the CMake config for fuzzers, where you should; use the ``add_llvm_fuzzer`` to set up fuzzer targets. This function works; similarly to functions such as ``add_llvm_tool``, but they take care of linking; to LibFuzzer when appropriate and can be passed the ``DUMMY_MAIN`` argument to; enable standalone testing.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst:10037,config,config,10037,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FuzzingLLVM.rst,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"SUMMARY; -------. We met to discuss the LLVM instruction format and bytecode representation:. ISSUES RESOLVED; ---------------. 1. We decided that we shall use a flat namespace to represent our ; variables in SSA form, as opposed to having a two dimensional namespace; of the original variable and the SSA instance subscript. ARGUMENT AGAINST:; * A two dimensional namespace would be valuable when doing alias ; analysis because the extra information can help limit the scope of; analysis. ARGUMENT FOR:; * Including this information would require that all users of the LLVM; bytecode would have to parse and handle it. This would slow down the; common case and inflate the instruction representation with another; infinite variable space. REASONING:; * It was decided that because original variable sources could be; reconstructed from SSA form in linear time, that it would be an; unjustified expense for the common case to include the extra; information for one optimization. Alias analysis itself is typically; greater than linear in asymptotic complexity, so this extra analaysis; would not affect the runtime of the optimization in a significant; way. Additionally, this would be an unlikely optimization to do at; runtime. IDEAS TO CONSIDER; -----------------. 1. Including dominator information in the LLVM bytecode; representation. This is one example of an analysis result that may be; packaged with the bytecodes themselves. As a conceptual implementation ; idea, we could include an immediate dominator number for each basic block; in the LLVM bytecode program. Basic blocks could be numbered according; to the order of occurrence in the bytecode representation. 2. Including loop header and body information. This would facilitate; detection of intervals and natural loops. UNRESOLVED ISSUES ; ----------------- . 1. Will oSUIF provide enough of an infrastructure to support the research; that we will be doing? We know that it has less than stellar; performance, but hope that this will ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2000-12-06-MeetingSummary.txt:196,variab,variables,196,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2000-12-06-MeetingSummary.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2000-12-06-MeetingSummary.txt,4,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

Modifiability,"Sel is a framework that provides a set of reusable passes and utilities; for instruction selection --- translation from LLVM IR to target-specific; Machine IR (MIR). GlobalISel is intended to be a replacement for SelectionDAG and FastISel, to; solve three major problems:. * **Performance** --- SelectionDAG introduces a dedicated intermediate; representation, which has a compile-time cost. GlobalISel directly operates on the post-isel representation used by the; rest of the code generator, MIR.; It does require extensions to that representation to support arbitrary; incoming IR: :ref:`gmir`. * **Granularity** --- SelectionDAG and FastISel operate on individual basic; blocks, losing some global optimization opportunities. GlobalISel operates on the whole function. * **Modularity** --- SelectionDAG and FastISel are radically different and share; very little code. GlobalISel is built in a way that enables code reuse. For instance, both the; optimized and fast selectors share the :ref:`pipeline`, and targets can; configure that pipeline to better suit their needs. Design and Implementation Reference; ===================================. More information on the design and implementation of GlobalISel can be found in; the following sections. .. toctree::; :maxdepth: 1. GMIR; GenericOpcode; MIRPatterns; Pipeline; Porting; Resources. More information on specific passes can be found in the following sections:. .. toctree::; :maxdepth: 1. IRTranslator; Legalizer; RegBankSelect; InstructionSelect; KnownBits. .. _progress:. Progress and Future Work; ========================. The initial goal is to replace FastISel on AArch64. The next step will be to; replace SelectionDAG as the optimized ISel. ``NOTE``:; While we iterate on GlobalISel, we strive to avoid affecting the performance of; SelectionDAG, FastISel, or the other MIR passes. For instance, the types of; :ref:`gmir-gvregs` are stored in a separate table in ``MachineRegisterInfo``,; that is destroyed after :ref:`instructions",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/index.rst:1339,config,configure,1339,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/index.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/index.rst,1,['config'],['configure']

This code remembers the end block (for the; phi node), then creates the block for the loop exit (""afterloop""). Based; on the value of the exit condition, it creates a conditional branch that; chooses between executing the loop again and exiting the loop. Any; future code is emitted in the ""afterloop"" block, so it sets the; insertion position to it. .. code-block:: c++. // Add a new entry to the PHI node for the backedge.; Variable->addIncoming(NextVar, LoopEndBB);. // Restore the unshadowed variable.; if (OldVal); NamedValues[VarName] = OldVal;; else; NamedValues.erase(VarName);. // for expr always returns 0.0.; return Constant::getNullValue(Type::getDoubleTy(*TheContext));; }. The final code handles various cleanups: now that we have the ""NextVar""; value, we can add the incoming value to the loop PHI node. After that,; we remove the loop variable from the symbol table, so that it isn't in; scope after the for loop. Finally, code generation of the for loop; always returns 0.0, so that is what we return from; ``ForExprAST::codegen()``. With this, we conclude the ""adding control flow to Kaleidoscope"" chapter; of the tutorial. In this chapter we added two control flow constructs,; and used them to motivate a couple of aspects of the LLVM IR that are; important for front-end implementors to know.
