These easy workflows are a shorthand to deal directly with FASTA/FASTQ files as input and output. MMseqs2 provides many modules to transform, filter, execute external programs and search. However, these modules use the MMseqs2 database formats, instead of the FASTA/FASTQ format. For optimal efficiency, we recommend to use MMseqs2 workflows and modules directly.; Search; Before searching, you need to convert your FASTA file containing query; sequences and target sequences into a sequence DB.

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file.

MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for t",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/cf36b186fc1ea8a18d4edc2e225bd739b5cd10af.html:5730,Guid,Guide,5730,Home/cf36b186fc1ea8a18d4edc2e225bd739b5cd10af.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/cf36b186fc1ea8a18d4edc2e225bd739b5cd10af.html,1,['Guid'],['Guide']

Usability," combined. You can, for example, do a translated nucleotide against protein profile search.; How to cluster; Before clustering, convert your database into the MMseqs2 database format:; mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta DB. Then execute the clustering:; mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp. Please ensure that in case of large input databases the temporary direcotry provides enough free space.; For disk space requirements, see the user guide.; To generate a FASTA-style formatted output file from the ffindex output file, type:; mmseqs createseqfiledb DB clu clu_seq ; mmseqs result2flat DB DB clu_seq clu_seq.fasta. To generate a TSV-style formatted output file from the ffindex output file, type:; mmseqs createtsv DB DB clu clu.tsv. To extract the representative sequences from the clustering result call:; mmseqs result2repseq DB clu DB_clu_rep; mmseqs result2flat DB DB DB_clu_rep DB_clu_rep.fasta --use-fasta-header. Read more about the format here.; Documentation; The MMseqs2 user guide is available in our GitHub Wiki or as a PDF file (Thanks to pandoc!). We provide a tutorial of MMseqs2 here.; Memory Requirements; When using MMseqs2 the available memory limits the size of database you will be able to compute in one go.; We recommend at least 128 GB of RAM so you can compute databases up to 30.000.000 entries.; MMseqs2 will automatically subdivide the target database if less memory is available. Runtimes will slightly increase in this case.; You can calculate the memory requirements in bytes for L columns and N rows using the following formula:; M = (7 × N × L) byte + (8 × a^k) byte. MMseqs2 stores an index table and two auxiliary arrays, which have a total size of M byte.; For a database containing N sequences with an average length L, the memory consumption of the index table is (7 × N × L) byte .; Note that the memory consumption grows linearly with the number of the sequences N in the database.; The two auxiliary arrays consume (8 × a^k) byte, with a being the size of the amino ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html:10951,guid,guide,10951,Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f74c46cb87bd297925dd0027c46b7838fb8dec62.html,4,['guid'],['guide']

In this command, examples/QUERY.fasta is the query file, examples/DB.fasta is the target database (either FASTA/FASTQ file or MMseqs2 database), alnResult.m8 is the file for alignment results, and tmp is a temporary directory for intermediate files.; Easy-Cluster; easy-cluster clusters entries from a FASTA/FASTQ file using the cascaded clustering algorithm.; mmseqs easy-cluster examples/DB.fasta clusterRes tmp.

Similar to easy-cluster, but more suitable for handling very large datasets efficiently.; Using MMseqs2 Workflows and Modules; While these easy workflows simplify tasks by directly working with common file formats like FASTA/FASTQ, MMseqs2 also offers a wide range of modules for more specialized operations like data transformation, filtering, and external program execution. These modules typically work with MMseqs2's internal database formats. For better performance and flexibility, it's often recommended to use MMseqs2's workflows and modules directly, especially for complex or large-scale bioinformatics analyses.; Downloading databases; Finding and setting up databases for different use cases can be a time-consuming; step.

Usability," memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Database Format; MMseqs2 works internally with the [ffindex] database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format was originally developed by Andreas Hauser to avoid drastically; slowing down the file system when millions of files would otherwise; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search.; ffindex databases have a simple key => data_record structure, in; which the alphanumerical key string corresponds to the file name; and the file content corresponds to the data_record.; ffindex databases consist of two files: an index file; <name>.index and a data file <name>.; The data file contains the plain concatenated data records,; separated by single \0 bytes (which in some editors are rendered as ^@),; thereby hiding them from the file system.; The data records can be accessed by the alphanumerical key string; using the index file. The index file contains; in each line the key and, separated by a tab, the offset in bytes; of the start of the corresponding data_record,; counted from the start of the data file.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12. The index contains four entries 10, 11, 12 and 13. The; entries have the offset position 0, 10, 25, 35 and the entry size 10,; 15, 10, 12 respectively. The according datafile could look like this:; PSSLDIRL\0GTLKRLSAHYTPAW\0AEAIFIHEG\0YTHGAGFDNDI\0.

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.; Example: computedValues or index; Local variable names; Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html:3337,clear,clear,3337,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html,2,['clear'],['clear']

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment.

Usability,"a cluster, that are reachable in a breadth first search starting at; the representative with the most connections.; Note that we always recommend to use the cascaded clustering workflow; instead of the clustering module for larger databases, since the maximum; cluster size is limited to a quite low value otherwise (between 50 and; 300 for large databases containing millions of sequences, depending on; the database size). The reasons are the limited result list length in; the prefiltering and alignment modules (the maximum list length; determines the maximum cluster size in the simple clustering workflow); and the high memory consumption of the clustering for large databases; with many alignment results per query.; Output File Formats; Results of MMseqs2 commands are stored in ffindex database format.; This format avoids creating gazillions of individual results files,; e.g. one for each query sequence of a many-to-many sequence search.; ffindex databases have a simple => <data_record> structure and consist; of two files: an index file .index and a data file .; The data file contains the concatenated data records split by \0 bytes; (which in some editors are rendered as ^@).; The index file contains a list of => pairs, one per line.; The offset gives the start of the <data_record> for in bytes,; counted from the start of the data file.; The file .index contains the identifiers of the; sequences for which t; Prefiltering; The database accession code is a numerical id of the query which was; sequentially assigned by createdb. Each line in the prefiltering; result database record (= one match) has the following format:; targetID -log(E-value) diagonal. where targetID is the database identifier of the matched sequence,; -log(E-value) is the ungapped negative logarithmic E-value of the match and diagonal is the; diagonal on which the match occurs. Example of a prefiltering. The first; line is a hit at sequence 2 on diagonal 0 with a -log(e-value) of 71 (e-value 1.46e-31).;",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/e449f31bbecbd8cc0087685111f7d641ece276ed.html:34356,simpl,simple,34356,Home/e449f31bbecbd8cc0087685111f7d641ece276ed.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/e449f31bbecbd8cc0087685111f7d641ece276ed.html,2,['simpl'],['simple']

To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files.

There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the hashclust and prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clustering’s down to 50% sequence identity in very short time. To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very hi",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1839528464b3b8e8bcb1aa19694870a58cf8aa24.html:24421,simpl,simple,24421,Home/1839528464b3b8e8bcb1aa19694870a58cf8aa24.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/1839528464b3b8e8bcb1aa19694870a58cf8aa24.html,17,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"an first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

The tool offsetalignment will offset the alignment position to the orf start position + alignment start * 3.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. and cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp --cascaded. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjusted with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if neither --cascaded nor -s are provided.; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the hashclust and prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clustering’s down to 50% sequence identity in very short time. To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity. Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignme",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/d31c1f8a4bb7d29ab36a26c1458aa5f1ba020c1a.html:24540,Simpl,Simple,24540,Home/d31c1f8a4bb7d29ab36a26c1458aa5f1ba020c1a.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/d31c1f8a4bb7d29ab36a26c1458aa5f1ba020c1a.html,3,['Simpl'],['Simple']

MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 400 times faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment.

Command stands for one of many commands or workflows such as search, easy-search, createdb etc., args stands for other obligatory arguments the command might need, and options can be given to change parameter settings or modify the behaviour of the command in some way. Workflows and commands are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are bash scripts chaining elementary mmseqs commands and other workflows together.; You can get information about any mmseqs command by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the command. For example ""mmseqs createdb"" will give you its usage as; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster.

Usability,"e normal search workflow. The mapping workflow can also be used in iterative-best-hit mode, where each query that does not find any match is searched with higher sensitivity again.; If either queryDB or targetDB is a nucleotide sequence database, MMseqs2 will use the translated sequence search mode described above.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster or mmseqs linclust. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjusted with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if -s is not provided.; Linclust can be used by calling linclust. The sensitivity can be adjusted by --kmer-per-seq (default 20).; $ mmseqs linclust inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow cluster combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:.

Usability,"e.; Getting started; Here we explain how to run a search for sequences matches in the query; database against a target database and how to cluster a sequence; database. Test data (a query and a target database for the sequence; search and a database for the clustering) are stored in the examples; folder.; Usage of MMseqs2 modules; Calls to MMseqs2 modules and workflows have the structure:; mmseqs module input_db output_db args [options]. module stands for one of many modules or workflows such as search, easy-search, createdb, etc. args stands for other obligatory paths/filenames the module needs, and options can be optionally given to change parameter settings or modify the behavior of the module in some way. Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are shell scripts chaining elementary MMseqs2 module and other workflows together. A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h. Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster.

Usability,"ements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Database Format; MMseqs2 works internally with the ffindex database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format was originally developed by Andreas Hauser to avoid drastically; slowing down the file system when millions of files would otherwise; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search.; ffindex databases have a simple key => data_record structure, in; which data records, corresponding to the file contents,; can be accessed using their unique alphanumerical; key string, corresponding to the file name.; ffindex databases consist of two files: an index file; <name>.index and a data file <name>.; The data file contains the plain concatenated data records,; separated by single \0 bytes (which in some editors are rendered as ^@),; thereby hiding them from the file system.; The data records can be accessed by the alphanumerical key string; using the index file. The index file contains; in each line, separated by tabs, (1) the key, (2) the offset in bytes; of the data_record counted from the start of the data file, and (3); the size of the data record.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12. The index contains four data records 10, 11, 12 and 13. The; entries have the offset position 0, 10, 25, 35 and the data record size 10,; 15, 10, 12 respectively.

C++ Standards; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes std::map (careful!).; However, weights any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they are extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(); s.clear();); smart pointer (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful. std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);.

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux and Mac OS. The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped a",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f30e4b4a10d84dae1d23a78e16398c3ef45647df.html:4171,Guid,Guide,4171,Home/f30e4b4a10d84dae1d23a78e16398c3ef45647df.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f30e4b4a10d84dae1d23a78e16398c3ef45647df.html,1,['Guid'],['Guide']

MMseqs2: ultra fast and sensitive protein search and clustering suite; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software suite to search and cluster huge proteins/nucleotide sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for Linux, MacOS, and (as beta version, via cygwin) Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability. MMseqs2 can run 10000 times faster than BLAST. At 100 times its speed it achieves almost the same sensitivity. It can perform profile searches with the same sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.; The MMseqs2 user guide is available in our GitHub Wiki or as a PDF file (Thanks to pandoc!); Please cite:; Steinegger M and Soeding J.

Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clustering’s down to 50% sequence identity in very short time.

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);.

To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. and cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp --cascaded. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjust with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if neither --cascaded nor -s are provided.; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clusterings down to 50% sequence identity in very short time.; To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; sequence identity.

MMseqs2 workflows combine and chain these single-purpose modules into larger tasks, such as searching, clustering or taxonomic annotation. When you pass -h to a workflow it will show a combined list of parameters of all individual modules. Some parameter combinations might be non-sensical or conflicting. Generally, be careful when you change parameters from -h.; Easy Workflows in MMseqs2; MMseqs2 includes easy workflows like easy-search, easy-cluster, and easy-linclust, which are designed to simplify common tasks like searching and clustering using FASTA/FASTQ file formats.; Easy-Search; The easy-search workflow enables searching with a FASTA/FASTQ file against another FASTA/FASTQ file or a pre-built MMseqs2 target database.; mmseqs easy-search examples/QUERY.fasta examples/DB.fasta alnResult.m8 tmp.

Usability,"le from each database key to its taxon id. Such a database includes the following files:; seqTaxDB, seqTaxDB.index, seqTaxDB.dbtype, seqTaxDB.lookup, seqTaxDB_h, seqTaxDB_h.index, seqTaxDB_h.dbtype, seqTaxDB_mapping and either the taxonomy flat file databases seqTaxDB_nodes.dmp, seqTaxDB_names.dmp, seqTaxDB_merged.dmp or seqTaxDB_taxonomy a binary version of the former files (created by createtaxdb which reduces the read-in time of the taxonomy database).; As detailed in the following sections, there are several ways to create and manipulate a seqTaxDB. Once created, seqTaxDB can be used by various MMseqs2 modules to assign taxonomic labels to sequences based on their similarities to the sequences of seqTaxDB. The result database of searching sequences against a seqTaxDB is referred to as taxonomyResult.; Creating a seqTaxDB; The databases module provides a easy way to download and setup taxonomy; databases that we predefined (see Downloading databases). Follow this section to learn how to manually create a seqTaxDB.; First, create a sequence database:; mmseqs createdb seqTax.fasta seqTaxDB. Next, augment it with taxonomic information.; If your seqTaxDB contains Uniprot ids, the easiest way to do so is to call:; mmseqs createtaxdb seqTaxDB tmp. This module will download the Uniprot idmapping and ncbi-taxdump and map the identifier of the seqTaxDB to NCBI taxonomic identifier. By default, createtaxdb downloads the Uniprot id mapping file (idmapping.dat.gz), and thus only supports Uniprot identifiers.; If your seqTaxDB does not contain Uniprot ids or you wish to provide an alternative source for the taxonomic information, please follow the instructions here:. To create a seqTaxDB from an existing NCBI BLAST database (such as nr or nt), see the section Create a seqTaxDB from an existing BLAST database.; For the SILVA database use mmseqs databases or see Create a seqTaxDB for SILVA for an example how to build it yourself.; For the GTDB database see Create a seqTaxDB for",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f725fec3bd4c99489f3131e65fb1ff45555a9a99.html:52264,learn,learn,52264,Home/f725fec3bd4c99489f3131e65fb1ff45555a9a99.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/f725fec3bd4c99489f3131e65fb1ff45555a9a99.html,47,['learn'],['learn']

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

Usability,"nts).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; MMseqs Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the ffindex database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format was originally developed by Andreas Hauser to avoid drastically; slowing down the file system when millions of files would otherwise; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search.; ffindex databases have a simple key => data_record structure, in; which data records, corresponding to the file contents,; can be accessed using their unique alphanumerical; key string, corresponding to the file name.; ffindex databases consist of two files: an index file; <name>.index and a data file <name>.; The data file contains the plain concatenated data records,; separated by single \0 bytes (which in some editors are rendered as ^@),; thereby hiding them from the file system.; The data records can be accessed by the alphanumerical key string; using the index file. The index file contains; in each line, separated by tabs, (1) the key, (2) the offset in bytes; of the data_record counted from the start of the data file, and (3); the size of the data record. The keys have to be sorted; alphanumerically in ascending order, since matching keys are found; by binary search.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12. The index contains four data records 10, 11, 12 and 13.

Usability,"on memory requirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Database Format; MMseqs2 works internally with the ffindex database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format was originally developed by Andreas Hauser to avoid drastically; slowing down the file system when millions of files would otherwise; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search.; ffindex databases have a simple key => data_record structure, in; which the alphanumerical key string corresponds to the file name; and the file content corresponds to the data_record.; ffindex databases consist of two files: an index file; <name>.index and a data file <name>.; The data file contains the plain concatenated data records,; separated by single \0 bytes (which in some editors are rendered as ^@),; thereby hiding them from the file system.; The data records can be accessed by the alphanumerical key string; using the index file. The index file contains; in each line the key and, separated by a tab, the offset in bytes; of the start of the corresponding data_record,; counted from the start of the data file.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12. The index contains four entries 10, 11, 12 and 13. The; entries have the offset position 0, 10, 25, 35 and the entry size 10,; 15, 10, 12 respectively.

Usability,"on/run_regression.sh full-path-to-mmseqs-binary intermediate-files-scratch-directory. It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux and Mac OS. The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also  270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped alignment score in the first module. Both modules are; parallelized to use all cores of a computer to f",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/d6ca731b62bbb82c6017571808e2d0f83784f652.html:2579,Guid,Guide,2579,Home/d6ca731b62bbb82c6017571808e2d0f83784f652.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/d6ca731b62bbb82c6017571808e2d0f83784f652.html,1,['Guid'],['Guide']

The tool offsetalignment will offset the alignment position to the orf start position + alignment start * 3.; Clustering Databases using mmseqs cluster. To cluster a database, MMseqs2 needs a sequence database converted with; createdb and an empty directory for temporary files. Then, you can run; the clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp. and cascaded clustering with:; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp --cascaded. The sensitivity of the clustering can be adjust with the -s option.; MMseqs2 will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the; --min-seq-id parameter, if neither --cascaded nor -s are provided.; $ mmseqs cluster inDB outDB tmp . The clustering workflow combines the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules into either a simple clustering or a cascaded; clustering of a sequence database. There are two ways to execute the; clustering:. The Simple clustering runs the linclust, prefiltering, alignment and; clustering modules with predefined parameters with a single; iteration. Cascaded clustering clusters the sequence database using the; as first step linclust and then prefiltering, alignment and clustering modules incrementally in; three steps. Cascaded Clustering; The cascaded clustering workflow first runs linclust, our linear-time clustering module, that can produce clusterings down to 50% sequence identity in very short time. To achieve lower sequence identities and/or to further improve the resulting clusters,; we continue with three cascaded clustering steps: In the; first step of the cascaded clustering the prefiltering runs with a low; sensitivity of 1 and a very high result significance threshold, in order; to accelerate the calculation and search only for hits with a very high; ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9e9b966e6f5d058b217302ce3187aa535eccb75c.html:24401,simpl,simple,24401,Home/9e9b966e6f5d058b217302ce3187aa535eccb75c.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/9e9b966e6f5d058b217302ce3187aa535eccb75c.html,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"quirements).; We offer an option for limiting the memory usage at the cost of longer; runtimes. The database is split into chunks and the program only holds; one chunk in memory at any time. For clustering large databases; containing tens of millions of sequences, you should provide enough free; disc space (~500 GB). In section Optimizing Sensitivity and Consumption of Resources, we will discuss the runtime, memory; and disc space consumption of MMseqs2 and how to reduce resource; requirements for large databases.; Database Format; Most MMseqs2 commands use the ffindex database format; (https://github.com/soedinglab/ffindex_soedinglab).; The format was originally developed by Andreas Hauser to avoid drastically; slowing down the file system when millions of files would otherwise; need to be written or accessed, e.g. one file per query sequence; in a many-to-many sequence search.; ffindex databases have a simple key => data_record structure, in; which data records, corresponding to the file contents,; can be accessed using their unique alphanumerical; key string, corresponding to the file name.; ffindex databases consist of two files: an index file; <name>.index and a data file <name>.; The data file contains the plain concatenated data records,; separated by single \0 bytes (which in some editors are rendered as ^@),; thereby hiding them from the file system.; The data records can be accessed by the alphanumerical key string; using the index file. The index file contains; in each line, separated by tabs, (1) the key, (2) the offset in bytes; of the data_record counted from the start of the data file, and (3); the size of the data record. The keys have to be sorted; alphanumerically in ascending order, since matching keys are found; by binary search.; An example index file (file extension .index) could look like this.; 10 0 10; 11 10 15 ; 12 25 10; 13 35 12. The index contains four data records 10, 11, 12 and 13. The; entries have the offset position 0, 10, 25, 35 and",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/290380d3b961f362d56de6cbde3857245540a096.html:13704,simpl,simple,13704,Home/290380d3b961f362d56de6cbde3857245540a096.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/290380d3b961f362d56de6cbde3857245540a096.html,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"r ARM64 systems with support for NEON instructions. You can also disable the automatic setup of architecture-specific compilation flags with -DNATIVE_ARCH=0. Use -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS and -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to set the flags for your system. This is useful in combination with the -mtune/-march/-mcpu flags of GCC/Clang if you know exactly what system your binary will later run on.; To disable the use of the ips4o sorting library, which requires atomic compare exchange instructions for 16-byte/128-bit values, you can use -DDISABLE_IPS4O=1. Usually, MMseqs2 automatically enables/disables ips4o depending on the system, and this flag should not be changed.; You can change the MMseqs2 version string, which is printed in help texts and by the version module, with the -DVERSION_OVERRIDE parameter. This is useful for packaging MMseqs2 to set a custom version string for the distribution name.; The -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 parameter enables additional build types for debugging MMseqs2. Refer to the developer guide for more information.; The -DHAVE_MPI=1 parameter builds the MPI version of MMseqs2. See the How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI section for more information.; MMseqs2 requires OpenMP support for compilation, and it will refuse to compile without it. To build a single-threaded version of MMseqs2, use the -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 parameter during the cmake invocation.; MMseqs2 requires zstd to compile. You can use the system-provided zstd instead of the bundled one by using -DUSE_SYSTEM_ZSTD=1 during the cmake invocation.; Getting started; Here we explain how to run a search for sequences matches in the query; database against a target database and how to cluster a sequence; database.

Test data (a query and a target database for the sequence; search and a database for the clustering) are stored in the examples; folder.; Usage of MMseqs2 modules; Calls to MMseqs2 modules and workflows have the structure:; mmseqs module input_db output_db args [options]. module stands for one of many modules or workflows such as search, easy-search, createdb, etc. args stands for other obligatory paths/filenames the module needs, and options can be optionally given to change parameter settings or modify the behavior of the module in some way. Workflows and modules are the same from the user perspective. Internally, workflows are shell scripts chaining elementary MMseqs2 module and other workflows together. A list of all available modules can be printed with mmseqs -h.; You can get information about any MMseqs2 module by simply calling it without arguments and options, e.g.; mmseqs createdb. It will give a short description, the usage, and a list of the most important options. The usage explains the syntax of the module. For example, mmseqs createdb will give you its usage as:; Usage: <i:fastaFile1[.gz]> ... <i:fastaFileN[.gz]> <o:sequenceDB> [options]. <...> denote files, <i:...> and <o:...> denote input and output files, respectively, brackets [] indicate that what is enclosed is optional, whereas everything not enclosed in [] cannot be omitted.; An extended list of parameters can be shown by adding the -h flag to the MMseqs2 call:; mmseqs createdb -h. Easy workflows; We provide easy workflows to search and cluster. The easy-search searches directly with a FASTA/FASTQ file against a either another FASTA/FASTQ file or an already existing MMseqs2 target database.; mmseqs easy-search examples/QUERY.fasta examples/DB.fasta alnResult.m8 tmp .

Summary; MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many searching) is a software suite to search and; cluster huge sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software; implemented in C++ for Linux and Mac OS. The software is designed to run; on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.; MMseqs2 reaches the same sensitivity as BLAST magnitude faster and which; can also perform profile searches like PSI-BLAST but also 270x faster.; At the core of MMseqs2 are two modules for the comparison of two; sequence sets with each other - the prefiltering and the alignment; modules. The first, prefiltering module computes the similarities; between all sequences in one query database with all sequences a target; database based on a very fast and sensitive k-mer matching stage; followed by an ungapped alignment. The alignment module implements an; vectorized Smith-Waterman-alignment of all sequences that pass a cut-off; for the ungapped a",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/e449f31bbecbd8cc0087685111f7d641ece276ed.html:4117,Guid,Guide,4117,Home/e449f31bbecbd8cc0087685111f7d641ece276ed.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Home/e449f31bbecbd8cc0087685111f7d641ece276ed.html,2,['Guid'],['Guide']

Then alignments are calculated and the database is; clustered. The second step takes the representative sequences of the; first clustering step and repeats the prefiltering, alignment and; clustering steps. This time, the prefiltering is executed with a higher; sensitivity and a lower result significance threshold for catching; sequence pairs with lower sequence identity. In the last step, the whole; process is repeated again with the final target sensitivity.

Also, it allows very large cluster sizes in the end; clustering resulting from cluster merging (note that cluster size can; grow exponentially in the cascaded clustering workflow), which is not; possible with the simple clustering workflow because of the limited; maximum number of sequences passing the prefiltering and the alignment.; Therefore, we strongly recommend to use cascaded clustering especially; to cluster larger databases and to obtain maximum sensitivity.; Clustering modes. Greedy incremental (--cluster-mode 2) works analogous to CD-HIT clustering algorithm. Greedy incremental clustering takes the longest sequence (indicated by the size of the node) and puts all connected sequences in that cluster, then repeatedly the longest sequence of the remaining set forms the next cluster.; Linear time clustering using mmseqs linclust. Linclust can cluster sequences down to 50% pairwise sequence similarity and its runtime scales linearly with the input set size.; Linclust is composed of five stages: 1.)

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file.

This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

Usability,"the Docker engine.; In such a case, run the commands above as ""sudo docker build ...""; The script that runs the regression test is found here:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/scripts/run_codeship_pipeline.sh; There is also a docker image that runs the regression test:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/Dockerfile; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

Usability,"time-consuming k-mer matching and gapless alignment stages prefilter among multiple servers, two different modes are available. In the first, MMseqs2 can split the target sequence set into approximately equal-sized chunks, and each server searches all queries against its chunk. Alternatively, the query sequence set is split into equal-sized chunks and each server searches its query chunk against the entire target set. Splitting the target database is less time-efficient due to the slow, IO-limited merging of results. But it reduces the memory required on each server to (7 × N L/#chunks) byte + (a^k × 8) byte and allows users to search through huge databases on servers with moderate memory sizes. If the number of chunks is larger than the number of servers, chunks will be distributed among servers and processed sequentially. By default, MMseqs2 automatically decides which mode to pick based on the available memory (assume that all machines have the same amount of memory).; Make sure that MMseqs2 was compiled with MPI by using the -DHAVE_MPI=1 flag (cmake -DHAVE_MPI=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..). Our precompiled static version of MMseqs2 can not use MPI.; To search with multiple server call the search workflow with the MPI command exported in the RUNNER environment variable. The databases and temporary folder have to be shared between all nodes (e.g. through NFS):; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs search queryDB targetDB resultDB tmp. The same requirements apply to clustering or any of the other workflows:; RUNNER=""mpirun -np 42"" mmseqs cluster DB clu tmp. Add a custom footer; . . . Toggle table of contents; Pages 3. Loading.

This can be useful in combination with the -mtune/-march/-mcpu flags of GCC/Clang if you know exactly what system your binary will run on.; We use the ips4o sorting library which requires atomic compare exchange instrutions for 16-byte values.; If your system does not have reliable support for this instruction you can disable the use of this library with -DDISABLE_IPS4O=1. Usually MMseqs2 automatically enabled/disabled ips4o depending on the system and this flag should not be changed.; The MMseqs2 version string, which is printed in help texts and by the version module, can be changed with the -DVERSION_OVERRIDE parameter. This is useful for packaging to e.g. set a custom suffix for the distribution.; The -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 parameter enables additional build types for debugging MMseqs2. Refer to the developer guide for additional information.; The -DHAVE_MPI=1 parameter builds the MPI version of MMseqs2. See the How to run MMseqs2 on multiple servers using MPI section for additional information.; MMseqs2 refuses to compile without OpenMP support. To enable building a single-threaded only version of MMseqs2 pass the -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 parameter to cmake.; Getting started; Here we explain how to run a search for sequences matches in the query; database against a target database and how to cluster a sequence; database.

Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.; Example: computedValues or index; Local variable names; Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, ",MatchSource.WIKI,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html:3332,clear,clear,3332,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html,2,['clear'],['clear']
