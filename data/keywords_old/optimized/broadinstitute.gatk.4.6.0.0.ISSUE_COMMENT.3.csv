I've identified where the problem is, and is about to issue the fixing PR in a minute. Basically, the problem is that this particular assembly contig (more specifically, the last two mappings to the same alt reference ""chromosome"") should be filtered out in the master pipeline because the two alignments are showing a particular signature which I call incomplete picture in the prototyping code&mdash;the assembly contig is suggesting two reference blocks switched orders,; which would normally suggest tandem duplication, but the reference blocks also overlaps (see ribbon plot [here](http://www.genomeribbon.com/?perma=cdB92bihIE)). ; And the filtering criterion is used in a wrong way after #3752 so that this is not caught.

Deployability,"@dantefff Thank you for making this fix. It seems like the recommended solution based on https://blogs.apache.org/logging/entry/log4j-2-11-released. . The downside is that it seems to nearly double the size of the packaged jars. I'm going to try to look into why that is exactly and see if there's a work around. The annoying thing is that we're not really aiming to actually produce a multi-version jar, we just want to incorporate the files that are version specific for the version we need. So I suspect there's probably a way to do this without including many additional versions of each file in the final jar. It might be a bit more involved. .

Deployability,"@david-wb Interesting... what version of spark / spark submit are you using? I was pretty sure that at the point where setMaster() was called by gatk the spark context was already created by yarn and setup with the appropriate master. I wonder if it changed from a previous version of spark... Alternatively, I may be misremembering and relying on the fact that our wrapper script supplies `--sparkMaster yarn` as a gatk argument which would probably override what's being set. Could you try:; ```; spark-submit \; --deploy-mode client \; --class org.broadinstitute.hellbender.Main \; --master yarn \; /home/hadoop/gatk-package-4.alpha.2-269-gdce8abc-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar BwaSpark \; --bwamemIndexImage /var/tmp/hs38DH-V.fasta.img \; -I hdfs:///unaligned.bam \; -O hdfs:///aligned.bam \; -R hdfs:///hg38/hs38DH-V.fasta \; --disableSequenceDictionaryValidation true \; --sparkMaster yarn; ```. or with the wrapper: ; ```; GATK_SPARK_JAR_ENV_VARIABLE=/home/hadoop/gatk-package-4.alpha.2-269-gdce8abc-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar. ./gatk-launch \; --bwamemIndexImage /var/tmp/hs38DH-V.fasta.img \; -I hdfs:///unaligned.bam \; -O hdfs:///aligned.bam \; -R hdfs:///hg38/hs38DH-V.fasta \; --disableSequenceDictionaryValidation true \; -- \; --sparkRunner SPARK \; --sparkMaster yarn; ```. Our wrapper script sets a number of properties which we think are important for running our spark tools. If running directly on spark you might want to set them explicitly. Things like `-Dsamjdk.compression_level=1` have MAJOR performance implications. . Also, be aware the BwaSpark is not in the best health at the moment may have issues.

That patch reduces the number of reads stored in memory at once by the engine by roughly an order of magnitude without doing any extra downsampling at all. I suggest that we do an evaluation to test whether this really resolves the issues you encountered. `Mutect2` is already hooked up to the new, lower-memory traversal code in the latest gatk/master, so all you have to do is re-run your benchmarking test. I'd suggest that you:. 1. Run with default settings in the latest master, and see if that alone does the trick!. 2. If not, try turning up the existing downsampling a bit. Eg., run with `--maxReadsPerAlignmentStart 10` instead of the default of 50. 3.

Deployability,"@davidbenjamin It's actually worth exploring, I think -- with a Spark implementation it is much easier for end-users running the GATK directly to run with multiple cores. Multi-process interval-based parallelism is only trivial when using a pipeline runner. .

Deployability,"@davidbenjamin LODs are fixed, but I'm not super happy with them. They fluctuate a lot, making for a big GVCF. How easy would it be to modify the likelihood calculation to integrate over all AFs greater than some threshold of interest? I'm hoping that would produce more stability. Just to give you an idea of the fluctuation, below are some lines from my integration test VCF where I block anything less than -2 and between -2 and 0. I tried a few other thresholds, but it's just a lot of variability.

Deployability,"@davidbenjamin Sorry I've been out and just got around to looking at this. Given that this test appears to run just fine in the Java 11 job (which is not run on our docker), I suspect the failure may have something to do with the jar file we use to test on the docker (which is not the same jar we use on the non-docker tests). . I pulled your branch and all of the generation tasks (gatk doc, wdl gen, javadoc) seem to work fine, so given how much time it looks like this has taken up, I think it would make sense to either disable this test (on the docker only - see below - since we want it to still run in the other CI integration test job), or else remove the variantcalling package from the test package list (if thats the one thats causing the failure ?). And then create a ticket for me with whatever data you have, which I'll follow up on. If you restore everything to its natural state, you should be able to add this to the `DocumentationGenerationIntegrationTest.documentationSmokeTest` method and then it will be skipped only when running on the docker:. ```; final DocumentationGenerationIntegrationTest dt = new DocumentationGenerationIntegrationTest();; if (dt.isGATKDockerContainer()) {; throw new SkipException(""See gatk issue #..."");; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6351#issuecomment-1216668361:623,integrat,integration,623,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6351#issuecomment-1216668361,1,['integrat'],['integration']

I tested the updated `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` with `genomicsDBs` computed in 4.1.7.0 as above and it seems that the workaround recovers a lot of multiallelic variants that were already missing in 4.1.7.0. Using the record and variant counts in 4.1.7.0 as 100% reference, I'm getting 57% more records (all multiallelic) or 142% more variants. No sites from 4.1.7.0 are missing in 4.1.9.0. As a side note, all of the new records have `FRACTION=1` and most (90%) have `BETA=1,1;FRACTION=1`. Among shared records, all multiallelic sites also have `FRACTION=1` and almost always different beta parameter estimates compared to 4.1.7.0. As expected, biallelic sites are unchanged.

I can't call it a bug because mathematically speaking it is an improvement. At worst it can be considered an arbitrary movement along the ROC curve. Regardless, we have always developed Mutect2 and its successor under the principle that theoretical soundness is the best long-term policy. That is not to deny or disregard that some changes harm performance on some data. There is a chance that adjusting the `-f-score-beta`, which controls the relative contribution of recall and precision to the weighted F score that FilterMutectCalls seeks to optimize, will be able to reverse this shift and give up the gained recall in exchange for the lost precision.

Deployability,"@droazen @davidbenjamin any thoughts regarding the last bullet above in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471 on possible integration tests? Started looking at this today and was wondering if you might have any suggestions. Ideally, we'd want to test that the exposure was done correctly through the 3 affected tools: HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, and FilterAlignmentArtifacts. I can certainly take the approach outlined above and 1) on master, pick one or more integration tests for each tool, then generate results by changing the original unexposed constants and running on the relevant test data, 2) on this branch, commit those new results, then add corresponding versions of the integration tests that change the exposed inputs and check against the results. However, not sure if we'll want to clutter the repo with more test files just for this sort of exposing of constants, and such tests don't really feel complete anyway. So alternatively, I could probably write a script to do essentially the same thing and just check consistency between the branches for a bunch of randomly generated SW parameter values, perhaps also running on more substantial test files for each tool. I can document this process and then we can move on without committing any new tests or test files once we're satisfied that the exposure was done correctly. Or if you guys have additional suggestions, would be glad to hear them!. Finally, it looks like FilterAlignmentArtifacts doesn't have any integration tests for correctness---let me know if there are auxiliary tests we'd want to run there. Anyway, probably overthinking things, but the exposure was enough of a headache that I want to make sure I did it right.

Deployability,"@droazen @ldgauthier @eitanbanks @tfenne the issue with `GenotypeGvcfs` outputting the wrong phase will still exist, even if @tfenne makes the change to `HaplotypeCaller` (@tfenne: could you move further discussion of that fix to https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5772). While the above example is fairly simple to understand, since `GenotypeGvcfs` run on a single sample will simply re-capitulate the genotype from the gVCF. In this case, could we just compare the `PGT` field and the `GT` field to ensure they agree, and if they don't, swap the alleles in the `GT` field (for hets only)? . This brings up an other issue: what happens with multiple samples? If the genotype is changed for a sample, how is phasing information affected (in the PGT/PID fields too)? I couldn't find a place where the phasing information is updated when re-genotyping (`PGT/PID` are fixed).

I think that it was a deliberate decision to lift all reads into the initial rdd and then filter them in the transforms to what was needed by that transform. This is paying some performance cost in multi-stage pipelines which will potentially apply the same filters over and over again, but it simplifies the code because the filters can be baked into the transform and the pipeline writer doesn't have to think about them.

Deployability,"@droazen Thank you for the confirmation that HaplotypeCaller performs separate filtering passes on the read mapping qualities, and that the code on line 729 of HaplotypeCallerEngine.java (method ```filterNonPassingReads()``` ) is indeed executing subsequent to the ```MappingQualityReadFilter```. May I suggest, however, that MAPQ values less than 20 might not necessarily lead to an increase in FP variant calls? My understanding is that HaplotypeCaller uses MAPQ values only in a nonparametric rank sum test, in which case MAPQ is treated as an ordinal. This seems appropriate since the magnitude of a MAPQ value depends both on the data and on the computational model the read aligner uses to calculate it. With this in mind, a set of mappings with MAPQ in a lower range (e.g., ```--minimum-mapping-quality 10``` and a correspondingly lower ```--maximum-mapping-quality``` as well) might very well be appropriate for variant calling. So changing the semantics of ```MappingQualityReadFilter``` or parameterizing the currently-hardwired MAPQ range would enable additional control without affecting performance. @jamesemery I will watch for the HaplotypeCaller update that implements that functionality. And if you have a moment, could you please point me to the code that might be adversely affected by decreasing the low-end MAPQ threshold? I might have some ideas about that (or not!)...

Deployability,"@droazen any thoughts how we should proceed here, if at all? @ldgauthier reminded me that this story was unfinished and is getting a little stale. @fleharty take note if we want to report progress on this front to our MalariaGEN collaborators. On my end, there are a couple of things to do:; - [x] rebase and resolve conflicts; - [x] change TSV input as discussed above; - [x] add doc strings for new arguments; - [x] add integration tests to make absolutely sure exposure was done correctly, perhaps? I'm open to discussion about how this should be done. Complete coverage here will be difficult and perhaps not worth the effort, but I can probably put in a few tests that make sure changing the hard-coded values in master and doing the same via the exposed parameters in this branch have the same effect on a few existing test cases. However, while I'm doing the last three, I wonder if we could run whatever canonical evaluations/optimizations we have to see whether it's worth consolidating some of the parameter sets at this stage? I think there's an argument for having at least two sets (haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype), but I'm not sure how to justify having a separate set for dangling heads/tails. But also not sure which set the latter should be consolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval.

Deployability,@droazen sorry for a late response. I agree moving to java 17 would help. I do see that GATK itself is using the newer version of log4j but then its the transitive dependencies for the libraries used that bring in the older version of log4j. . this creates situations that the final compiled jar has both version of the log4j and this could create problems. . Gatk being a very useful tool gets integrated in multiple other tools and pipelines so in a way affecting the security posture of where its being used. The risk might be low being a standalone cli tool but its a very hard conversation with info security :) . May I ask for a ballpark ETA for the new version?

Deployability,"@droazen sure. This PR updates both `BucketUtils.getPathOnGcs` and `IOUtils.getPath` (the latter indirectly) to create a Google Cloud Storage filesystem with a default reopen set to 3. Anyone opening the given `Path` (or even a `Path` derived from it, e.g. via `subpath`) will have the retries enabled. `addPrefetcher` wraps an existing `Path`, so it inherits the underlying `Path`'s retry behavior. Classes within htsjdk that create a `Path` from a String, without using our utility code, would indeed not set retries and errors on those files would not get the benefit of our extra retry. The exception to that is the Spark code path with `NioBam`: this goes via `ReadsIterable`, which also sets the retries. My understanding is that the normal way to open BAMs for tools always creates the `Path` object when parsing the command line, as in e.g. `ReadInputArgumentCollection::GetReadIndexPaths()`. That code path that calls `IOUtils.getPath` (and thus sets the retries). I would expect that the added support for VCF follows the same style, though it looks like it doesn't. If there's a code path that I missed where you think we need retries then please let me know so I can add it!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2506#issuecomment-289585791:23,update,updates,23,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2506#issuecomment-289585791,1,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"@droazen the reason for hardcoding the full path is to handle grouping of arrays. TileDB manages arrays hierarchically. A workspace can contain arrays or groups of arrays. Groups can have different arrays with same name. When you read from an existing array or update it with a given workspace path, you need to figure out which array in the the group you are referring to, hence the full path. More information [here](http://istc-bigdata.org/tiledb/tutorials/index.html#workspaces_groups). The real issue here is to figure out a way to package TileDB arrays to ship it to some other location. The problem is the data and fragments inside the array directory is self-contained. If we replace the full path in the schema it will break other conventions for groups and workspaces.

Deployability,"@droazen this behavior hasn't changed in the most recent GenomicsDB release. . Short recap: this happens because bcf codec doesn't support the 64 bit values that GenomicsDB is returning. Running with `--genomicsdb-use-vcf-codec` will resolve it. From our discussions in the office hours, I thought we had decided to change the behavior in htsjdk so that it doesn't try to decode the type if it doesn't recognize it. (maybe I should have filed https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6548 in htsjdk instead? I thought I was told to do in GATK, but its been long enough that I can't remember). Another possibility is to make `--genomicsdb-use-vcf-codec` the default - though I recall you had some potential performance concerns about that. Lastly, we could change GenomicsDB to throw out a warning if a 64 bit value is needed and we're using bcf codec. Of course, this would still require the user to (re)run with `--genomicsdb-use-vcf-codec` to avoid hitting the NPE (or whatever other failure would be hit if the NPE was changed to something a bit more meaningful).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6667#issuecomment-646167430:68,release,release,68,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6667#issuecomment-646167430,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"@fleharty If you can come up with a way to handle genotypes with missing AD in the tool (that does not involve dropping them completely) I believe that would solve the problem, yes. The following code snippet from the tool shows the current behavior, where genotypes get filtered out if AD is missing:. ```; final List<Genotype> variantGenotypes = vc.getGenotypes().stream(); .filter(g -> hasArtifact(g, germlineAF)).collect(Collectors.toList());. private final boolean hasArtifact(final Genotype g, final double populationAlleleFrequency) {; final int altCount = altCount(g);; if (altCount == 0) {; return false;; }; final int totalCount = (int) MathUtils.sum(g.getAD());. return germlineProbability(populationAlleleFrequency, altCount, totalCount) < maxGermlineProbability;; }. private static final int altCount(final Genotype g) {; return g.hasAD() ? (int) MathUtils.sum(g.getAD()) - g.getAD()[0] : 0;; }; ```. AD will be missing completely if there were *any* missing values present after combination, due to the issues in HTSJDK discussed above. These missing values are there only because the pipeline is combining VCFs rather than GVCFs -- with GVCFs, you have the NON_REF allele and can fill in these missing values. Back when GenomicsDB used the BCF codec by default, the AD value would get truncated at the first missing value, instead of completely removed as it does with the VCF codec. This suggests that the AD values the tool was seeing were never correct in the first place, and the tool should probably be relying on a different attribute. Only AD and PL are affected by this HTSJDK issue. Is there another attribute you could use instead of AD in `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals`?.

Deployability,"@fpbarthel In that case, I would not average the bins---I'd simply take the total integer count across them, which you can then use with the rest of the pipeline and should decrease the noise as you describe. You can still use CollectReadCounts, but it will be up to you whether you want to 1) collect counts on manually merged bins, or 2) collect counts on the initial bins and manually sum the counts for the merged bins. Another option might be to use PreprocessIntervals to create 10kb bins across the genome and then manually intersect that with your list of exons (i.e., keeping only the bins that overlap with your exons) before collecting counts. There are multiple ways one might define such merged bins, which makes it hard to come up with a single tool to cover every possibility. Fortunately, it should be relatively easy for users to put together their own custom script for merging bins. For these reasons, I think it makes sense to not focus too much CNV-team development effort on adding features like this---our philosophy is to leave such pre/postprocessing steps to the user, and focus on CNV-specific algorithms such as denoising, segmentation, etc. Hopefully that makes sense!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439916142:153,pipeline,pipeline,153,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439916142,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"@frank-y-liu Something has gone slightly wrong in this branch git-wise -- it looks like you've duplicated some commits from master, and the merge commits in your history imply that your git workflow needs some tweaking. In general, you want to always `rebase` rather than `merge` or `pull` (and avoid mixing the two, which can cause problems), since `rebase` produces a much cleaner history. Since you're working in a fork, you should create an ""upstream"" remote if you haven't already:. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk.git`. Then when you're working in a branch to which you've made one or more commits, and you want to update your branch with the latest changes from our master, do this:. `git fetch upstream`; `git rebase -i upstream/master`. This will bring up a screen allowing you to ""squash"" (combine) your work into a single commit that is suitable for merging into our master branch. If you do this with the current version of your branch, and select ""squash"" for all but the top commit, I believe you'll succeed in repairing your git history. .

I can pretty reliably move back to the previous commit and it goes away. It always surfaces in the VariantSparkSinkUnitTests, but it seems to be the result of a cumulative effect since AFAICT it only happens when running the full test suite via ""./gradlew clean test"". I tried changing the default values of useJdkInflater and useJdkDeflater to true, and I still get the same problem. Interestingly, disabling all of the tests in IntelInflaterDeflaterIntegrationTest seems to reliably fix it (even with useJdkInflater/Deflater set to false), so I'd start there.

However, that might not be true of more general use cases, so it's certainly worth investigating more robust formats. @SHuang-Broad For all current CNV use cases, we use separate columns for each annotation.

Deployability,"@jamesemery the use of padding is a little confusing. One use of padding is for providing extra reference bases around the reads. This is the case in `ReadWalkerSpark`, for example. When the whole reference is available via the Spark files mechanism (which is what this PR is about) then there is no need for padding (and in the case of `ReadWalkerSpark`, no need for sharding at all). Therefore it makes sense to remove the use of padding in these cases. Another use of padding was for providing more reads around an area of interest in assembly region/haplotype caller tools. This is no longer the case though, since the refactoring that @droazen did in `HaplotypeCaller` in #4031. However, `HaplotypeCallerSpark` has not been updated to reflect the changes from that refactoring, so it's probably best not to change the padding in that class. I've reverted the change there for this reason. The locus walkers never had any need for padding, except for padding reference bases in `LocusWalkerSpark`, mentioned above.

Deployability,"@jfarrell Do you recognize ""scc"" as a local host name ? ""hdfs:///project/casa/gcad/adsp.cc/sv"" looks reasonable enough as a file URI, except that the hadoop file system provider requires an authority component (the part of the uri between the second and third slash: ""hdfs://authority-component/..."") be provided in such URIs. Since you didn't include one as part of the hdfs path on the command line, it looks like transform along the way resulted in one being added (the authority component looks like ""host:port""), resulting in the port number -1. So I'm not clear if its a configuration issue, or a bad code code path, or both. But I would suggest trying an hdfs path with a valid authority component (one that works with the hadoop shell). @SHuang-Broad I do see some code paths in `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` that call `Paths.get directly`, rather than `IOUtils.getPath()`.

Deployability,"@kcibul That NPE suggests that GenomicsDBImporter is failing to find a reader for a particular sample name. One possible cause of this is disagreement between the samples in your `--sampleNameMap` file and the sample names in the VCF headers. Due to a bug that I noticed just now (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2714), the `GenomicsDBImporter` class in GenomicsDB unnecessarily uses the actual VCF headers to construct a list of sample names internally, which it then uses to query a map of `sample -> reader` that was (in your case) populated using the contents of the `--sampleNameMap` file. I've asked Intel to fix that bug in GenomicsDB (ie., use the sample names passed in to it instead of going back to the VCF headers), but it will probably take them 1-2 days, since a new GenomicsDB release will be required. In the meantime @kcibul, I suggest you try running without the `--sampleNameMap` argument and see if the problem goes away. It will likely be a bit slower, since it will download all VCF headers up-front, but it seems to me to greatly decrease the opportunity for this particular NPE to occur.

Some minor updates were made to the Java code in #8049 and the WDL was rewritten by me to do SNPs and indels in a single pass in #8074. (EDIT: I was originally confused here, the WDL that was replaced in this PR simply ran SNPs and indels separately, rather than serially—thanks to George for correcting me here.). The PR here makes relatively minor updates to both the Java code and the WDL and might require very minor updates to GVS code or JSON configurations.

Something better for downstream toolkits will be to create a `gatk.properties` file with entries for both the GATK-jar version and gatktool-python version; it can be easily parsed by gradle to populate the values.

This is at the top of our discussion list for next week. GenomicsDB interfaces use these JSON files today which contain input configuration, list of samples, mapping between sample IDs and TileDB row indexes and stream ids for the input VCFs. If this tool takes the list of VCFs and intervals as input, we'd have to recreate JSON files internally and pass it to GenomicsDB. I wanted to avoid this for now as we are thinking about overhauling the input methodology completely in GenomicsDB with protocol buffers, but this is going to take a while.

Deployability,"@lbergelson Sorry to be unclear---this isn't a GATK issue. For Cromwell, you can configure various options for each backend. For example, if you are running on a local backend with Docker, you can set a `submit-docker` attribute to specify the string that runs the Docker container; so to solve the above problem, you'd set this to include `--shm-size` and set it accordingly. However, according to @jsotobroad, you're not allowed such an attribute when submitting to Google cloud. If that's the case, then this is more of an issue with the Cromwell/Google Pipelines interface than the data.table package (although, as the discussion in the GitHub issue above shows, it'd be a simple fix on the data.table end, so I'm not sure why it's not addressed yet...) Changing the R script to get around the issue in this particular case is not unacceptably ugly, but you could imagine we might run into a similar problem in the future if anything else exceeds the 64MB /dev/shm limit and also cannot specify tmpfs.

I'm currently on vacations but I will try to respond (with some delay) any question.; So, what I'm seeing here (using Github web without having a proper dev env) is that for each interval, it's going to call (in parallel) sample reader function from the configuration =>; ```; final Map<String, FeatureReader<VariantContext>> sampleToReaderMap =; this.config.sampleToReaderMapCreator().apply(; this.config.getSampleNameToVcfPath(), updatedBatchSize, index); ; ```; That's is the first difference from previous implementation. If whatever you have in that function consume lots of memory, that's an issue.; Regarding the thread pool, I'm not seeing it's being starved by chromosome parallel import but it might use extra memory to execute since there is a high load of threads use due to the number of parallel imports.; Worker threads can execute only one task at the time, but the ForkJoinPool doesn’t create a separate thread for every single subtask. Instead, each thread in the pool has its own double-ended queue (or deque, pronounced deck) **which stores tasks**.

Deployability,"@lbergelson. Our simple s3 nio library is not currently open source, but we would be willing to make it so after testing it properly. We found that to get the s3 nio library work with GATK, a few minor changes needed to be made in the GATK source. This is especially true for the spark tools because, on AWS EMR Spark clusters, s3 uris can be treated exactly as if they are HDFS uris. Therefore, it was not quite as simple for us to just add the s3 nio library to the classpath and have everything work as expected. For that reason we put the project on hold until GATK is closer to release.

The tests need updating, but it's easier to see what breaks then fix than run the tests locally! But please see if you agree with the rest of the PR while I update the tests manually. A few notes on the various tools related to making the genotype phased:. 1. Both `HaplotypeCaller` and `Mutect2` support the `--do-not-run-physical-phasing`, so all this can be turned off by the user. I am not going to add another command line option as this may confuse the user.; 2. `FilterMutectCalls` uses the `Mutect2FilteringEngine` internally. It does not look at the order of the alleles in the genotype (`GT` FORMAT field), but does look at the various other per-allele FORMAT fields (ex. `AD`, `AF`). Fortunately, I do not change their order in this PR as suggested by @ldgauthier.; 3. As @ldguathier note [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433970809) and [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433986488), that VQSR and Sam F's work do not look at genotypes either.; 4.

Deployability,"@ldgauthier @yfarjoun We have an update on this! We've identified the bug:. * When `AbstractFeatureReader.getFeatureReader()` tries to open a `.vcf.gz` that doesn't have an index, it returns a `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader` instead of a `TabixFeatureReader`, because `methods.isTabix()` returns false when an index is not present.; * `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader`, in turn, opens a Java vanilla `GZIPInputStream`, instead of the `BlockCompressedInputStream` that gets opened when you create a `TabixFeatureReader`.; * `GZIPInputStream`, in turn, has a *confirmed bug* filed against it in Oracle's bug tracker (see https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7036144#), that it inappropriately relies on the `available()` method to detect end-of-file, which is never safe to do given the contract of `available()`; * As the final piece in the ghastly puzzle, implementations of `SeekableStream` in htsjdk do not implement `available()` at all, instead using the default implementation which always returns 0. As a result of this combination of bugs in Java's `GZIPInputStream` itself and bugs in htsjdk's `SeekableStream` classes, end-of-file can be detected prematurely when within 26 bytes of the end of a block, due to the following code in `GZIPInputStream.readTrailer()`:. ```; if (this.in.available() > 0 || n > 26) {; ....; }; return true; // EOF; ```. Where `n` is the number of bytes left to inflate in the current block. The solution is to replace all usages of the bugged `GZIPInputStream` with `BlockCompressedInputStream` in tribble in htsjdk (at least, for points in the code where the input is known to be block-gzipped rather than regular gzipped).

This fixed a pretty rare (but not rare enough that it wasn't causing mismatches in my other work) error in GATK where we would be mis-sizing assembly windows where indels that overlapped snps were involved.

Deployability,"@ldgauthier I think at some point we removed example JSONs in both the CNV and M2 WDL directories. I believe the reasoning was that those JSONs were mostly non-informative templates that could just as easily be generated with `womtool inputs`; since they were also not tested (in contrast to the JSONs used by the Travis WDL tests), they had to be kept in sync manually. @davidbenjamin @LeeTL1220 can correct me if I'm wrong. In contrast, providing Jack's hyperparameters for WES via JSONs will actually be informative! However, we will inevitably run into some issues touched upon in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4719. I agree that it would be desirable to set some default WES/WGS hyperparameters in the featured workspace. However, I hope this wouldn't require two separate workspaces for WES/WGS or any shenanigans like that. Ideally, this sort of thing could be covered at the tool level with argsets, as mentioned in that issue. @droazen any updates there?. In any case, I'm not sure having the JSON in this repo and not covered by any tests is what we want. ; Maybe @bshifaw can chime in? Are the featured workspaces covered by tests elsewhere?

The intersection is to avoid a bug where the requested trimmed padded region is bigger than the original padded region, but `intersect(region)` causes it to lie within the original unpadded region, which is unnecessary and probably harmful to sensitivity (the trimming cigar didn't hurt sensitivity, but I wonder if this mistake may have offset a net benefit that it should have created).

Deployability,"@ldgauthier Tests are still failing because I haven't updated test vcfs. Before I do so could I get your opinion? Here's a summary of the rationale behind each commit:. * fa34758 When we get to `realignReadToBestHaplotype` we have discarded bases outside of the assembly region but we still have hard clips in the read Cigar. This change forces us to keep those Cigar elements after realigning to the best haplotype so that we know how far past the assembly window the read extended.; * 6af7ad4 After the above change, `BaseQualityRankSum` was liable to look for discarded bases in the hard-clipped part of the read. This fixes that.; * 952d217 The `Clipping` annotation doesn't do anything. It counts the number of hard clips, but pre-this PR there are no hard clips because those bases don't get realigned to the best haplotype and post-this PR the ""hard clips"" are just bases outside the assembly region. As a placeholder I'm setting it to zero (note how this doesn't break any tests!) but really I think we should just get rid of it.; * This PR introduced some off-by-one errors in the depth annotation (but not the ADs). While looking into this I found an apparent bug where some reads that don't overlap a variant get counted in the depth. The issue was that we were counting clipped bases in the overlap. I don't think this is correct because by this point in the code we have unclipped soft clips and gone through local reassembly. Therefore, anything clipped here is a part of the read we truly don't believe belongs anywhere near the assembly region. This change alone breaks the tests with a few off-by-one DP fields.; * 8c51c0a Uses hard clips in the Cigar to correct read position annotations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806:54,update,updated,54,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806,1,['update'],['updated']

GT:AD:DP:F1R2:F2R1:GQ:PGT:PID:PL:PS 0|0:161,0:161:9,0:152,0:99:0|1:21900146_C_G:0,484,7601:21900146 0|0:183,0:183:16,0:167,0:99:0|1:21900146_C_G:0,566,8911:21900146 0|1:85,89:174:5,1:80,88:99:0|1:21900146_C_G:3525,0,3544:21900146; chr1 21900151 .

You'll notice that both `GT` and `PGT` have phased genotypes. And in the case of samples with a homozygous genotype, the `PGT` has an incorrect heterozygous genotype. Going back and looking more closely at the test files that I updated, I also see where the `GT` is `1|1` that the `PGT` is erroneously heterozgyous. In talking to @nh13 about this, he pointed me at a section of code in `AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine` that purposefully sets the genotype to either `0|1` or `1|0` with a long note on line 512 that this is on purpose and that it'll get ""fixed"" later. Evidently that's not happening on the code path in `HaplotypeCaller` that generates a VCF as opposed to a GVCF. If this PR is likely to get accepted _and_ someone can point me in the right direction for fixing up the `PGT`, I'd be happy to try and fix that.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5772#issuecomment-471062432:927,update,updated,927,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5772#issuecomment-471062432,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"@lucidtronix @mbabadi @samuelklee I think the best solution would be to establish a single, common Python environment, with a single set of dependencies, that all GATK Python tools depend on. We would establish a single docker image that has all of these dependencies pip installed, and could also include a conda env for the GATK environment for users who don't want to use the docker image. If we could do that, it would eliminate the need load per-tool conda environments. From what I've seen so far based on existing branches, the two environments we need (gCNV and CNN-VQSR) don't look that far apart in terms of dependencies. gCNV is using Theano, and CNN Tensorflow, but the rest looks [pretty close](https://docs.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/spreadsheets/d/1RV7--uBQ0ctlXzMH09cmr0VimpZYIU68DdxJzE60y-c/edit?usp=sharing). So a strawman proposal for the main components for a common environment would be:. Python 3.6; Numpy >= 1.13.1; Scipy 1.0.0; Theano .0.9.0; Tensorflow 1.4.0; Pymc3 3.1; Keras 2.1.1.

Deployability,"@magicDGS The HaplotypeCaller traversal has undergone some changes in the past few weeks to improve performance and bring the output of the tool closer to GATK3. There is now an `AssemblyRegionWalker` that divides the intervals into active and inactive regions, in a greatly simplified version of the GATK3 traversal. Initially, I did plan on having `AssemblyRegionWalker` extend the former `ReadWindowWalker`, or an adapted version of your `SlidingWindowWalker`, and I did implement it like this at first, but ultimately I collapsed it into a single class for several reasons:; - Inheriting from a more generic traversal type caused usability issues and confusion with respect to the command-line arguments. The `ReadWindow` was the unit of processing for the superclass, but for `AssemblyRegionWalker` it was the unit of I/O and `AssemblyRegion` was the unit of processing, and I couldn't update the docs for `ReadWindowWalker` to clear up the confusion without mentioning `AssemblyRegion`-specific concepts.; - The `ReadShard` / `ReadWindow` was/is **only** there to prove that we can shard the data without introducing calling artifacts, and to provide a unit of parallelism for the upcoming Spark implementation. It's not something we really want to expose to users as a prominent knob, and we may hide it completely in the future once the shard size is tuned for performance.; - Inheriting from a more abstract walker type caused a number of other problems as well: methods that should have been final in the supertype could no longer be made final, with the result that tool implementations could inappropriately override engine initialization/shutdown routines. Also, there were issues with the progress meter, since both the supertype traversal and subtype traversal needed their own progress meter for their different units of processing. Ultimately it was just too awkward and forced, and the read shard is something that we eventually want to make an internal/encapsulated implementation d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513:891,update,update,891,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513,1,['update'],['update']

As for the docker, we're going to have strike the right balance between image bloat and performance(including test performance). I think we're around 4+ gig now, and counting. Before the Python integration we were at 1.9G, and trying to find ways to reduce it. So lets see where we wind up but keep that in mind. Finally, we need to find a way to install the (GATK) python package(s) without depending on access to the GATK repo. Right now I think the gCNV branch has a ""pip install from source"" added to the conda env .yml. That will work on the docker at the moment (and thus on travis), but that won't work for non-docker users how don't have source/repo access. Also, one of the proposals to reduce the size of the docker is to remove the repo clone that is currently there. My proposal is that we change the gradle build to create an archive/zip of the python source (this would include the VQSR-CNN package code as well as gCNV kernel). We can then copy that on to the docker image, and pip-install it from the copy. That would retain the ability to always run travis tests based on the code in the repo, and also keep the nightly docker image in sync. We'll also have deliver the archive as an artifact somehow (perhaps including PyPi) for non-docker users.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3912#issuecomment-350303277:14,update,updated,14,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3912#issuecomment-350303277,12,"['configurat', 'install', 'integrat', 'update']","['configuration', 'install', 'integration', 'updated']"

Deployability,"@mlathara and @nalinigans A couple quick updates:. - ReblockGVCFs reduced gVCF size by 5-8x as advertised. I re-ran this on our ~2000 gVCFs, which is possibly one of the main reasons for improvement below.; - This meant we needed to scrap all existing workspaces. As a side comment, the poor tools around manipulation of GenomicsDB workspaces is a pretty major disadvantage. Your guidance seems to suggest they are designed as a quasi-permanent store of gVCF data. Maybe I'm missing something, but this doesnt seem very workable anymore. Any need to modify any sample that went into the workspace means the whole thing needs to be re-created. For example, we also plan to re-generate some older gVCFs with the newer HaplotypeCaller at some point in the future, and doing this would also mean we need to scrap any existing workspaces. ; - For this round, I started with the 2000 gVCFs, and ran scatter jobs where each has ~1/750th of the genome, split more or less evenly (i.e. no attempt yet to intelligently design borders). Unlike before, each job creates the workspace on-the-fly, and then immediately uses it for GenotypeGVCFs. The workspace is basically a throw-away intermediate file. As far as computational time, this is not that bad (at least for very small intervals/job). I also did not bother running consolidate on these, and imported with a batchSize of 50.; - With the limited interval GenomicsDB workspaces, GenotypeGVCFs runs reasonably well. . So some open questions:. - It's unclear why running GenotypeGVCFs with a GenomicsDB workspace that has intact chromosomes, even when using -L over a small interval, fails to run or runs painfully slowly with extremely high memory. I will try to find time for actual profiling, but this is a little cumbersome since I'm not sure I can run this on my windows dev machine.

Deployability,"@nalinigans pointed out that even if we do switch this pipeline back to the BCF codec, it's still likely to encounter errors with 64-bit values due to some recent changes in GenomicsDB, which now throws an exception for these values instead of silently truncating them as it did in the past. So just switching to the BCF codec in the WDL might not be enough. A couple of other options we discussed today for a quick fix for this issue:. - @ldgauthier suggested that we change the WDL to use an older (pre-4.1.8.0) version of GATK that is known to work well with this pipeline, which would be an easy change. The only problem is that users might run `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` in the latest GATK independently of the WDL anyway and continue to run into this issue. - @nalinigans suggested that we patch `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` so that it does something sensible when the AD annotation is completely missing. Since AD was already likely being truncated by the BCF codec in previous versions of this pipeline, its value was never particularly trustworthy to begin with. Whatever option we go with, we'll need to add a good regression test for the PoN workflow that would have caught this issue. Longer term, we'll plan on developing a fix at the HTSJDK level for the way missing values are handled for the AD and PL annotations in the VCF codec (@lbergelson is currently looking into how this could be done). @fleharty What are your thoughts?

Deployability,"@nalinigans: We now believe this is actually a GenomicsDB issue (or possibly an issue in the JNI layer.). @gokalpcelik was able to reproduce this problem on a set of 330 whole exomes. He found that if he ran GenotypeGenotypeGVCs from a GenomicsDB the memory usage climbed up to 10s of GB, but the java heap memory remained constant. He then tested firt extracting the combined GVCF from genomics db and then running GenotypeGVCFs and saw that memory usage for GenotypeGVCFs remained constant at 1 G. So we think this is probably a GenomicsDB issue. . GenomicsDBImport > GenotypeGVCFs ---- Memory ramps up immediately to 10s of gigabytes; GenomicsDBImport > SelectVariants to GVCF > GenotypeGVCFs ---- Memory is fixed at 1.1 GB.

Deployability,"@neuro2019 Well, the gatkDoc task relies on running the javadoc process with a custom doclet. I'm not sure why its not working for you, but a few suggestions to try. You can try running `javadoc` from the command line to make sure you have the executable. Also, it looks like you're trying to run from within`/usr/bin`. Not sure if thats deliberate, but do other gradle tasks succeed there, i.e., does `./gradlew shadowJar` work ? I would expect that `./gradlew javadoc` would also fail ? Also, normally the gatkDoc task is only run by us when we do a new release and publish the doc. Its not something most users would need to do.

Deployability,"@nh13 As a first step I'd suggest filing a ticket against the GKL (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL) so that Intel engineers can have a look (but leave this GATK ticket open so that we can track it here as well). . This will be difficult to debug without a test case that Intel can run to reproduce the issue on their end. Does the crash only occur with this one particular sample, or have you seen it on more than one sample? If you could get to the point where you can reproduce it on a shareable bam snippet, that would obviously maximize the chances of this getting fixed. Intel is currently (at our request) doing a pass on the GKL with `valgrind` to find and fix memory safety issues (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/107), so we expect the next GKL release to fix a bunch of ""use after free""-type errors. Maybe they'll get lucky and fix this one as well. Timeline for the release is within the next ~2-3 months. . After that we've asked them to test the GKL with long reads data, which is also known to trigger crashes like this (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/105).

Deployability,"@samuelklee Because our repo is open-source, even if we hide them from the docs, users end up asking questions on them. So no to hiding any tool that is in the repo. . - More importantly, it is good to have documentation for our own selves for these tools that we use internally or legacy tools. Once a developer leaves, this is all that typically remains for the rest of us that may have to answer forum question on the code or further develop the functionality. We get questions on all ranges of tool versions and minor releases. . Even when we deprecate a tool or feature, we give people fair warning that the tool/feature will be deprecated before literally removing it from the codebase. - I understand you would rather folks drive the new car but the old clunky car model is out there on the road and is being driven by researchers right now. When they have questions, they come to the GATK forum for answers and we need to have at the least tool documentation. ; - If time is limiting, the least we should do for these legacy tools is to state within the doc that (i) folks should use another tool XYZ instead and (ii) the tool/option will be deprecated in the near future. Besides the `BETA` label, another option that will soon become available is the `Experimental` label for internal tools. @cmnbroad is implementing now. It would be great to have additional categories, but @cmnbroad says that this is as much as he has time to do for us and perhaps this is for the best because we don't want to clutter our docs with too many labels.

If you want to expose the SW parameters on the CLI now, I think 12 arguments is fine. Just give each argument a clear prefix indicating what it applies to (eg., `--read-to-haplotype-mismatch-penalty`).

Deployability,"@samuelklee I've worked through all of the issues with the other repos (Barclay, picard, etc.), so we're ready to move forward with Java 17 reviews, but the `ModelSegments` tests are still inconsistent.

They succeed when run locally or in the CI non-docker job. At one point when I looked into these, the values produced when the tests fail look similar(/identical ?) to the values that the tests USED to produce (i.e., I suspect if we reverted expected results files, the tests might succeed on the docker and fail on the non-docker). I'm not sure what is causing the instability, but this is going to become a blocking issue for this in the next couple of weeks. We also have the option of disabling them only on the docker (or non-docker), but I hate to do that. Can you take a look at this in the next week or so ?.

Deployability,"@samuelklee The module can now save and load everything, including the state of the optimizer. This allows to making interesting inference pipelines. Here's a decent strategy for obtaining the global optimum (it works flawlessly on simulated data every time):. - In the first pass, one disables annealing and obtains the variational parameters in a thermal state. The temperature needs to be _high enough_ to allow most/all local minima to merge, though, not too high to allow copy numbers to travel too far away from baseline copy numbers. If this occurs, one must anneal very slowly in the next stage (see below). The results are checkpointed once converged. - In the second pass, one makes another call to the CLI tool, this time w/ annealing enabled (starting from the same temperature) and starting from the checkpointed thermal results (model params, posteriors, adam(ax) state). The annealing rate must be slow enough to prevent thermal fluctuations from getting quenched (i.e. the evolution must be quasi-isothermal). One must look for a steady and linear rise of ELBO, such that when the annealing protocol ends, SNR quickly drops to values below 1. In both runs, the learning rate must be very small (in the rate 0.01-0.05) such that we wouldn't have to worry about controlling stochastic noise. Adam(ax) quickly adjusts its moment estimates and compensates for the small learning rate, so this doesn't increase the training time significantly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020:139,pipeline,pipelines,139,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020,2,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

In light of 1) I think the best way to fix this is to cap the estimate at 100%. It's not quantitative but at that level of contamination it doesn't really matter.

Deployability,"@sooheelee - I think that to have a proper test suite similar to GATK's 3, we need also some test that exercise some code paths that requires some specific scientifically meaningful data (for example, known indels that are also included in some sample). I am not that familiar with the test data on this or GATK3 repository, so I am not sure if that was already covered. @sooheelee - this is going to be an exact port of the indel-realignment pipeline, as it is in the GATK3 code, so that means that I won't modify the interval list format or anything (although I will use the HTSJDK/Picard classes as used on GATK3). Because this will be an experimental/beta feature, I think that I can have a look to the new format after acceptance of the original port. @cmnbroad - I understand that a fully functional tool is a requirement for acceptance, but what I mean is that some specific features might require more work than others. I am only concerned about the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, which is just an specific way of output the data but does not add anything to the real realignment process (actually, I think that I've never heard about anyone around me using it). That is a nice feature, but I don't think that it is a high-priority - I care more about having the algorithm implemented to test if the actual processing of the data works, and add support for some way of output the data in a different PR. In addition, if the people still using indel-realignment does not require the n-way output, then it is pointless to spend time on it. I was also thinking about the mate-fixing algorithm in the tool, because it can be performed afterwards with Picard, which is not constraining by any distance between reads or records in RAM - nevertheless, this is really a drop of functionality that will change results, and that's why I didn't propose that.

Deployability,"@t-ogasawara @frank-y-liu @gspowley @paolonarvaez @droazen @lbergelson please comment on the following proposal. The proposal is that we would spin off native PairHMM as a separate project/repo on github and host AVX code there and have alternative implementations extend that project/repo (by creating repos that depend on the AVX one). . In other words, now we have 1 repo, broadinstitute/gatk. After the proposed change we'll have 3 repos (all BSD licensed):; 1) broadinstitute/gatk; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-AVX; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-PPC. We will duplicate the native code (AVX and PPC will be separate copies of C++ files etc) to simplify the testing burden. The parties interested in working on a specific architecture will contribute code directly to the respective architecture-specific repo and gatk will take occasional updates of those repos. The gatk repo will depend on the other two. The PPC repo will depend on the AVX repo (and any other native repos will depend on the AVX one). The avx and ppc repos will have their own build systems and unit tests against the new interface. The AVX repo will expose something like the following Java API (to be worked out in detail). ```; //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from reads; public final class JNIReadDataHolderClass {; public byte[] readBases = null;; public byte[] readQuals = null;; public byte[] insertionGOP = null;; public byte[] deletionGOP = null;; public byte[] overallGCP = null;; }. //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from haplotypes; public final class JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass {; public byte[] haplotypeBases = null;; }. public interface NativePairHMMKernel extends AutoCloseable { . /**; * Function to initialize the fields of JNIReadDataHolderClass and JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass from JVM.; * C++ code gets FieldIDs for these classes once and re-uses these IDs for the remainder of the program.

Is it sufficient to look at the first two reads in the BAM file to determine whether the file is aligned or not? Scanning the whole file to see if it's aligned seems like overkill. I've updated this PR to look at the first two reads. Also, should we have a way of overriding these settings, to force alignment or single/paired mode? (BTW the single/paired read thing is an existing argument in BwaSpark.). 2. Is this an intrinsic problem with 2bit, or just the implementation? https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/pull/1508 will fix the implementation (when ADAM 0.23 is out).

Deployability,"@tfenne I'm not sure we quite expect every site in the provided intervals to be covered by a variant or homeVar call. If the HaplotypeCaller deems a site to be active then it is assembled and genotyped, the `EMIT_ALL_SITES` switch is applied to the genotyper and prevents the genotyper from returning a null variant context at sites that are clearly not real variants. That does not however mean that sites that never make it to the genotyper will get returned. That means activityRegions that are not considered sufficiently active to be assembled will still not be covered in the output in `EMIT_ALL_SITES` mode.

Deployability,@tfenne The gatk3 behavior when using intervals was that it only loaded data that started within the interval. We change that in gatk4 so queries get all overlapping data. This means that for GenoytpeGVCFs at least you should be getting all upstream deletions that overlap. If that's *NOT* the case then it's a bug we should fix. The side effect was getting duplicate calls in adjacent shards which is why we added `--only-output-calls-starting-in-interval`. . The HaplotypeCaller behavior is probably different and I don't know for sure what it is. ![HaplotypeCaller leading deletion behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4700332/72105530-b569a080-32fb-11ea-9fc5-1adaee2ac039.png). It seems like there are 3 possible outcomes for a deletion that starts outside the interval in HaplotypeCaller. @davidbenjamin Do you know which we do?

Deployability,"@vdauwera The tools are categorized and listed in the Google Spreadsheet above. It is waiting for you to assign tech leads to tools for documentation. One thing that @chandrans brought to my attention is that for BaseRecalibrator one of the parameters (`-bqsr`) actually causes an error. One can no longer generate the 2nd recalibration table with correction on the fly and instead must use the recalibrated BAM through BaseRecalibrator to generate the 2nd recal table for plotting. **This type of information is missing from the tool docs.** Furthermore, updates I made to the BQSR slidedeck (that showcase this `-bqsr` parameter) are based on information from a developer and this information turns out to be incorrect now (perhaps correct at some point in development?). Soooo, I think it may be prudent that those responsible for tool docs test the commands on data. - [4] Make sure the doc content enables Best Practices, e.g. plotting BQSR recalibration, and ; - [5] Test example commands to ensure they work. If they do not, make corrections and notate the change in application in the documentation.; - [6] Remember @vdauwera's plan to change the representation of parameters from camel to KEBAB case.

Deployability,"@vruano @mwalker174 Any estimates on cost that could help determine the priority of issue 1? Specifically, is the disk cost required to localize the entire count file for all samples a determining factor? If we can drastically reduce this cost, then we can dedicate more to increasing resolution, etc. Here is a minimal set of fixes that could enable the querying of intervals for GermlineCNVCaller (and also for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy without too much extra work, since we also subset intervals there) *only in the gCNV WGS pipeline*, without disrupting other interfaces:. 1) Write a Tribble SimpleCountCodec for the `counts.tsv` extension. I've already done this in a branch.; 2) Change GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy tools to accept paths.; 3) If an index is present for each count path, create a FeatureDataSource, merge the requested -L/-XL intervals, and query to perform the subset. We will also need to stream the SAM header metadata. It should not require much code to extract all this to a temporary IndexedSimpleCountCollection class. (Caveat: for now, this will work with the current gCNV convention of providing bins via -L/-XL. Technically, it will also work with the more conventional use of -L/-XL to denote contiguous regions, but we may have to perform checks that bins are not duplicated in adjacent shards if they overlap both, since querying a FeatureDataSource will return any bins that overlap the interval---rather than only those that are completely contained within it.); 4) Index read-count TSVs in the gCNV WGS pipeline after collection and modify the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and GermlineCNVCaller tasks to take read-count paths and indices, if necessary. These changes could be confined in the gCNV WGS WDL for now. I think that should do the trick. If this is high priority, I can implement now. In the future, we might be able to promote all Locatable CNV Records to Features and write code to automatically pass the columns/encoders/de",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082:532,pipeline,pipeline,532,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Actually, I'm going to go ahead and add some exact match tests to guard against this sort of thing. Behavior for key somatic CNV tool modules (i.e., kernel segmentation and MCMC) is unit tested to within statistical noise (so, not exact match) on simulated data, but most integration tests just check for plumbing and not correctness. The idea was always that this sort of thing would be covered by what eventually became CARROT, since such tests would probably have to be long running and require more resources than are available in the repo to be useful. See the high priority but long dormant issues https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4122 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123, as well as https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4630. In fact, I think the original idea was that Lee's validation would be the first to go into CARROT. Note also that I did some work to set up transition of all existing CNV tests (also including the somatic CNV validation against TCGA SNP calls that I put together on Terra) before going on leave and moving off CNVs, but during all that, we managed to 1) lose TCGA access, 2) delete the test files on which Lee based his validation after he left, and 3) reassign at least one of the people that was going to help with the transition. Again, the resulting differences here are minor and it's unlikely that future non-CNV code changes will have similar effects, since the CNV code is relatively well encapsulated, but the exact-match checks will hopefully give us some peace of mind until CARROT tests are ready. @jonn-smith @KevinCLydon looping you in just in case you're not aware of all of this history.

Deployability,Added some changes per Laura's review. Mainly:; - added a `--genomicsdb-update-workspace-path` that specifies the path to an existing workspace for incremental import and interval_list generation cases; - removed `--incremental` since the above made it superfluous; - added an `--output-interval-list-to-file` argument that will just generate a picard style interval_list at the location specified by the argument for an existing workspace. No import done when this is used; - changed the existing tests to use multiple intervals instead of a single interval. @ldgauthier I'm not entirely sure about the picard interval_list generation. Any chance you could help with providing some expected input/output for that so that I can add a test for it?

Deployability,"After experimenting with this a bit, I think using failOnVersionConflict is too inflexible. Currently, we're silently picking up newer versions of dependencies because we're relying on Gradle's default resolution strategy. But if we switch to using failOnVersionConflict, we'll have to resolve each conflict manually, and then we'll have the opposite problem: we'll silently remain pinned to older versions. I think what we really want is to fix the ""silent"" part, so that we have a mechanism that notifies us when we've introduced a change that results in a change to transitive dependency resolution, and gives us a record of which commits caused the change, without necessarily requiring us to manually pin the dependency to a particular version. I propose that we add a file to the repo containing the output of the ""dependencies"" task, and also add a Gradle task that compares that file with the current ""dependencies"" output. Anytime dependencies change, the task/build will fail, and the file diff will tell us what transitive dependencies changed. We can then choose how to resolve the change; either by force resolution, or by just updating the file. The file would have to be updated every time our explicit dependencies change, but the file history would give us a record of which commits changed transitive dependencies.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2592#issuecomment-300280478:1186,update,updated,1186,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2592#issuecomment-300280478,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Bayesian GMM:. This is essentially an exact port of the sklearn implementation, but only allowing for full covariance matrices. I think it might be good for those in the Bishop reading group to take a look during review.

This is so we can prioritize merging the IsolationForest implementation for @meganshand. We can easily add this module back when it's been reviewed separately. TODOs:. - [x] Class-level docs.; - [x] Method-level docs. I think pointers back to the original sklearn code will suffice for most methods, but I've also included some parameter descriptions. Also note that I've retained original sklearn comments throughout the implementation and have also commented on mathematical expressions where it might be helpful.; - [x] Unit tests. There's already test data (generated using Pyro) checked in and the results match the sklearn implementation to high precision, I just need to write numerical checks. There are also already unit tests for static utility methods. Future work:; - [ ] Expanding unit tests to cover more of the interface. These initial unit tests will almost certainly not completely cover the possibilities allowed by the interface, e.g. warm starts. Could be a good exercise for other developers. EDIT: At least one test of warm starts has been added.; - [ ] As mentioned in the prototyping discussion, expanding this implementation to properly include marginalization might be of future interest.

Deployability,"By default we only support OSX and modernish linux on amd64. We don't have a plan to test or officially support aarch64. However, it's mostly java so it might mostly work? The things I can think of off the bat that won't work are the optimizations for intel hardware, i.e. the fast pairhmm and deflate/inflate optimizations will definitely not work. They **should** degrade to java implementations automatically though. . IBM has a fork that works on power8 which reimplements some of the optimizations for PairHMM, so it's definitely possible to implement the various native optimizations for other architectures although not a small project. . GenomicsDB won't work since we only bundle libs for amd64/osx. You could in theory compile it yourself and pass the library on the library path. Other things that will need special attention would any of the library wrappers, for bwa-mem, fermlite, and hdf5. Those will similarly need custom builds supplied to the gatk. .

Deployability,"By modifying the test I was able to isolate the error in the `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils` package, which is strange because the PR did not modify the javadoc for any class in that package. The integration test runs `com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute` and asserts that the output code is zero, which does not yield a useful error message. In order to produce something more meaningful I hacked the test to output the entire `stdout` and `stderr` as follows:. ```; final StringWriter out = new StringWriter();; final PrintWriter err = new PrintWriter(out);. final int result = com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute(""program"", err, err, err, ""doclet"",docArgList.toArray(new String[] {}));; err.flush(); // probably not needed; String message = out.toString(); // message contains the entire stdout and stderr of the call to execute; Assert.assertEquals(result, 0, message);; ```.

Deployability,"Can you give a bit more information here? If I'm understanding correctly, it's not clear that the same issue is at play here. The original issue was that duplicate/incomplete fragments were causing queries to the workspace to fail. . In this latest instance, it seems you are appending additional samples to the existing workspace. Is that right? If so,; - are you seeing the same/similar error? That is, it's a core dump? Can you share the error messages, any logs, core dump files etc?; - did you clean up the workspace before importing? That is, remove the incomplete fragment @nalinigans identified and the duplicated ones?. My first instinct is that even if the incomplete/duplicated fragments weren't cleaned up, the incremental import shouldn't have an issue -- at least not till it gets to the consolidate phase, which only happens after all batches are imported. Sounds like you were seeing an issue at batch 3 of 4, so might have something to do with the samples in that batch...or some other import issue. You mentioned that previous imports to this particular contig failed -- were those just transient failures that worked when rerun, or was there some configuration that you changed to get that to work?. For completeness, the way I identified duplicate fragments was to do an md5sum check on some of the internal files. If any pair of fragments have the same md5sum they are likely duplicates. So, from the workspace directory, something like:. ```; find . -name ""ALT.tdb"" -exec md5sum {} \;|sort; ```; That will highlight the fragments that are potentially duplicate. To confirm that the fragments are indeed duplicates, you'll then want to take that list of potentially duplicate fragments and check that all corresponding files within each pair of potentially duplicate fragments actually have the same md5sum.

The tension is that AS is used in the scoring but becomes practically useless after that. >> Correct, but I am having thoughts about this now (not to pick only one—that; would be wrong—but to ditch them altogether probably under some condition; and redo the alignment step), exactly because of this behavior I observe.; Think about the case where one originating gapped (say insertion); alignment, after splitting, has one of the two children contained in; another alignment (not its sibling, that's impossible) in terms of their; read span.

Deployability,"Consolidated with #2498. Now that #6885 is done, I'm going to kick off a Bayesian optimization (using the pipeline-optimizer from https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-evaluation/tree/master/pipeline-optimizer I presented on long ago) over all 3 sets of SW parameters using unfiltered HaplotypeCaller -> vcfeval F1 on NA12878 chr22 (with F1 optimized on GQ threshold and enabling decomposition of variants) as the target. This is probably not what we want to ultimately do in practice---we may want to more heavily weight sensitivity after calling, hook up variant filtering, stratify on high/low confidence regions or variant characteristics, etc.---but I'm just curious to see what happens. I see two potentially useful outcomes: 1) we demonstrate that parameters don't have much of an effect and can be consolidated, or 2) we find more optimal sets of parameters. Potentially we could also show that 3) our parameters are already optimal (I'd say this would be by pure dumb luck), in which case we could at least demonstrate and document some justification for them. If the parameters don't have much of an impact on NA12878, I'm curious to see whether this holds for low coverage or messier data---and ultimately, in malaria. Just starting with NA12878 because of the availability of truth and the potential impact for the primary use case of calling in human data. Some preliminary results: I ran the aforementioned comparison on chr22 with 1) 4.1.8.1 master and 2) 4.1.8.1 with haplotype-to-reference SW parameters changed from `NEW_SW_PARAMETERS` to `STANDARD_NGS` on two replicates of NA12878 (O1D1 and O2D2 from the 2018 NovaSeq snapshot experiment). On each replicate, 2) demonstrated slightly lower performance, but it was well within the sample-to-sample variation between these two replicates. Here are the corresponding vcfeval summaries:. ```; ::::::::::::::; NA12878/O1D1/4.1.8.1/summary.txt; ::::::::::::::; Threshold True-pos-baseline True-pos-call False-pos False-neg Precision Sen",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566:106,pipeline,pipeline-optimizer,106,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline-optimizer']

Deployability,"Copying in some discussion about my initial, incorrect, effort in PR #2547:. David Roazen:; As discussed in person, we fully support the mission of making this class less stateful (and particularly making it so that `isVcCoveredByDeletion()` does not modify state, which was the original ticket), but we're concerned that this method `calculateOutputAlleleSubset()` was intended to be stateful, and to accumulate deletions across calls. It's also not well covered by tests, so this change could easily break the method. Can you think about this issue and reply here once you've looked into it, davidbenjamin ? Also at-mentioning ronlevine to solicit his comments, since he appears to have added `upstreamDeletionsLoc` to this class in the first place. Ron Levine; droazen Is correct. It was intended to maintain state for upstream deletions. Make sure the upstream spanning deletion does not span shard barriers, then there will be problems with the book keeping. AFAIK, shards overlap genome locations but for a large spanning deletion, the size might not be sufficient. davidbenjamin Here is the motivation for the change: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1188 and accompanying pull request, [Removed spanning deletions if the deletion was removed](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/pull/1417).

We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations.

Deployability,"Debugging update: the issue in this case seems to be that HaplotypeCaller constructs an additional haplotype containing a fifth variant a little bit downstream of the four called variants. The fifth variant has low read support and is not called, but matches the reference base at all of the four called positions and so is out of phase with both of the possible phase sets suggested by the four called variants. This causes the current phasing algorithm to give up, as it requires all of the haplotypes containing alternate alleles at a locus to agree with one of the phase sets it creates. .

Deployability,"Executive summary: . My main concern is that the amount of unsupported code is continuing to grow. Adding this PR would bring the total to about ~5k lines of WDL, Java, and test code. In comparison, the amount of corresponding supported CNV code clocks in around ~33k---this includes all of gCNV, as well! Development time has also been non-negligible and dates back to pre-4.0 release. Another concern is that the number of users of this unsupported code is also growing. In fact, it seems like we are actively pointing users to it. This seems unsustainable going forward. Finally, I don't think we have satisfactorily demonstrated which of the functions accomplished by this code (format conversion, post-hoc blacklisting, germline/""CNLOH"" tagging and imputation) are necessary or cannot be performed by existing code or more streamlined and principled methods. (Some of these functions, such as IGV conversion, are already performed by existing code.) Of those functions, I think format conversion is the only one we should retain from this code in an unsupported fashion. So if this PR introduces a useful GISTIC conversion, no harm in merging that. This all sounds like a decision for the new tech lead! @mwalker174 any thoughts? . More detailed responses follow:. > Users are already using this branch and giving me positive feedback (definitely more positive than adjusting num_changepoints_penalty_factor). I suggest merging mostly for practical reasons. It buys us more time to put in a principled solution. And this workflow is clearly marked as an unsupported prototype anyway (as are the GATK CLIs). I want to emphasize that this whole workflow is not a long-term solution. In other words, I would like to get this in and then focus on a supported solution. While it's great that users are giving positive feedback, I refer you to CellBender team's manifesto at https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender/commit/28f02f8dbd716aff922bb8da1e56da29347b245b.

This tool extracts annotations, labels, and other relevant metadata from variants (or alleles, in allele-specific mode) that do or do not overlap with specified resources. The former are considered labeled and each variant/allele can have multiple labels. The latter are considered unlabeled and can be randomly downsampled using reservoir sampling; extraction of these is optional. The outputs of the tool are HDF5 files containing the extracted data for labeled and (optional) unlabeled variant sets, as well as a sites-only VCF containing the labeled variants. This VCF can be used in ScoreVariantAnnotations to in turn specify an additional ""extracted"" label, which can be useful for indicating those sites that were actually extracted from the provided resources (since we may only extract over a subset of the genome). TODOs:; - [x] Integration tests. Putting together tests using chr1:1-10M snippets of 1) the 1kgp-50-exomes sites-only VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet. EDITEDIT: Now using gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/joint_genotyping/exome/scientific/truth/master/gather_vcfs_high_memory/small_callset_low_threshold.vcf.gz provided by @ldgauthier, which does have AS annotations.; ; We'll use expected outputs here as inputs to downstream steps, but rather than provide the expected outputs directly, we'll create copies of them and provide those as inputs. This will make the tests better encapsulated. However, it should be relatively easy to update the whole chain of test files, shou",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948059:867,Integrat,Integration,867,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948059,1,['Integrat'],['Integration']

Deployability,"Fair points. I agree that legacy tools/versions that are part of a canonical or relatively widely used pipeline should have good documentation. However, there are many of the CNV tools that are basically prototypes---they have never been part of a pipeline, have no tutorial materials, and the chances that any external users have actually used them are probably extremely low. The sooner they are deprecated, the less the overall burden on both comms and methods---I don't think comms should need to feel protective of code or tools that developers are willing to scrap wholesale!. I'd like to cordon off or hide such tools so the program group doesn't get too cluttered---if we can do this in a way that doesn't require @cmnbroad to add more categories, that would be great. For example, we will have 5 tools that one might reasonably try to use for segmentation (PerformSegmentation, ModelSegments, PerformAlleleFractionSegmentation, PerformCopyRatioSegmentation, and PerformJointSegmentation). The first two are part of the legacy and new pipelines, respectively, but the last 3 were experimental prototypes. I think it's definitely confusing to have these 3 presented in the program group, and treating them the same as the other tools in terms of documentation is just extra work for everyone. In any case, I definitely think an additional program group to separate the legacy and new tools is warranted, since many of the updated tools in the new pipeline have very similar names to the legacy tools. If this is OK with everyone, I'll just add a ""LegacyCopyNumber"" program group, which I don't think should require extra work on anyone else's part.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346187604:103,pipeline,pipeline,103,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346187604,5,"['pipeline', 'update']","['pipeline', 'pipelines', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Finished refactoring the production code as detailed above, just need to add some tests. Results are exactly the same as before in single-sample mode---except for allele-fraction-only mode. This is because I refactored all existing segmenters (there were separate ones for copy-ratio-only, allele-fraction-only, and copy-ratio + allele-fraction) as special cases of a single multisample segmenter; however, the Gaussian kernel in the old allele-fraction-only segmenter was missing a normalization factor that is now present in the new multisample segmenter. Thus, users who previously ran in allele-fraction-only mode will have to retune parameters to achieve the same level of sensitivity. I expect that this will be a very small number of users (if any---note that allele-fraction-only mode isn't even exposed in the WDL), but we can probably mention it in the release notes.

Deployability,"From what I have heard from Dmitriy, this loss in Mutect2 precision between Mutect2 v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0 seems to be perfectly reproducible using default parameters on the HCC1395 somatic benchmark gold-standard from the [Sequencing Quality Control Phase II Consortium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Somatic+Mutation+Working+Group+of+Sequencing+Quality+Control+Phase+II+Consortium%5BCorporate+Author%5D). The drop in performance seems to still persist in the current Mutect2 version. If true, then this could have dramatic affects on Mutect2 clinical variant calling quality since v.4.1.9.0 until now. It would appear that isolating the root cause of this drop in performance has high importance for maintaining the clinical validity of Mutect2. It seems quite a number of Mutect2 code details have [changed between v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/4.1.8.1...4.1.9.0), as for instance [this commit concerning quality filtering](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/a304725a60f5000ec6381040137043a557fc3dc1), or [this one concerning soft-clipped bases](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/4982c2fa60e89f699a81150116d058aeac2f7573). Perhaps the circumstance of the drop in precision affecting WES but not WGS data may point to the culprit?. Also, may I ask whether the GATK team is doing real-world regression test on gold-standard variant callsets between version releases, and have these tests passed between v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1169735509:1434,release,releases,1434,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1169735509,1,['release'],['releases']

Deployability,"Hacked together a proof-of-principle in sl_indexed_counts. This enables streaming of indexed counts (when they are specified by a bucket, although we should change this to trigger on the presence of an index) only for the requested intervals in the gCNV step, which would cut disk costs to practically zero. We could enable this in the contig-ploidy step as well, although the cost benefit is not as great there since the tool is short running.

Deployability,"Hello @bharathramh thank you for your question. We just recently merged the bulk of the code for DRAGEN-GATK (#6634) which means that we are slated to release the DRAGEN-GATK for the next release of GATK. When that happens we will also be releasing an official wdl workflow to use all the new features together. . As for STR variants, one of the code improvements in the new genotyping engine is to better model STR errors by performing a per-sample pre-processing step where a table of empirically generated STR priors is generated by the tools `ComposeSTRTableFile` and `CallibrateDragstrModel`. These work by modifying the priors for genotying to be more in line with the sample PCR/Sequencing errors and can't really be thought of as a feature to ""find STRs"" (except `ComposeSTRTableFile` which is used to find STRs in the reference). These will be featured in the published wdls with appropriate commands. . I would recommend in the future that you direct questions like this one to our forums since this ticket tracker is used to track bugs/ongoing development on the GATK and our Comms Team is better equipped to answer questions there: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/topics",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6912#issuecomment-716747266:151,release,release,151,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6912#issuecomment-716747266,2,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hi @LiviaMoura ,. The dropped allele is expected behavior. One of the ways reblocking speeds up joint genotyping is by dropping information associated with alleles that are not in the most likely genotype. The subsequent alleles are not left aligned because the position doesn't change. Instead they are trimmed so that they use the minimal representation. Historically the FORMAT DP doesn't change when alleles are dropped (as in subsetting more than 5 alternate alleles in the previous pipeline). Given that this is a GVCF with a <NON_REF> allele, the most correct thing to do would be to move that 1 read associated with the dropped allele to the <NON_REF> AD so that the sum of the AD values are still equal to the FORMAT DP, but the NON-REF AD values will get dropped in the joint genotyping step anyway, so the change would only be reflected in the intermediate GVCF files. The DRAGEN data I had been working with didn't have allele fraction, but we also came across this issue independently. I made a fix and we're testing it now. If it looks good, I'll generalize it to use the header information rather than special casing particular annotations. I can put in some code to subset the posteriors as well.

Direct intervention and changing this code breaks certain unit tests which result in failure to build our conda and docker environments.

Deployability,Hi @RWilton i'm sorry to hear that. I suspect its unrelated given how simple this PR is but its quite possible that filter has been broken since evidently nobody was able to use and adjust it for a long time. This is the logic here that the filter uses:; `return read.isPaired() && !read.isUnmapped() && !read.mateIsUnmapped() &&; (Math.abs(read.getStart() - read.getMateStart()) >= mateTooDistantLength || !read.getContig().equals(read.getMateContig()));`. That logic is correct for what the filter is doing. It should be noted that the filter does the opposite of what you expect it to (since its intended for our SV pipeline) in that it filters out all reads that are NOT having distant mates. This means if you try to run HaplotypeCaller with this setting you will be throwing away every read pair EXCEPT the distant ones which results in mostly no reads. We should perhaps rename this filter to be a little less confusing.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098:619,pipeline,pipeline,619,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @Tintest,. Thanks for checking out GermlineCNVCaller! That is indeed a large cohort. The theano computational graph that represents the probabilistic model will be quite large and may require more memory than you have to successfully compile. We typically select a training cohort (perhaps 100-200 samples) to train the denoising model; ideally, all of your samples are from the same batch, but if not, you may want to train separate cohorts for each batch. These trained models can then be used to call subsequent samples in case mode using the appropriate model for each batch. Another strategy we use is to scatter gCNV runs across the exome/genome. I'd recommend including at least 10,000 intervals in each scatter shard, but you may be able to get away with more. I'd recommend studying the WDL at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/master/scripts/cnv_wdl/germline to see how we typically run the pipeline. @sooheelee is also working on a tutorial that will hopefully provide a useful hands-on example of running the workflow in this manner.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5053#issuecomment-407736504:914,pipeline,pipeline,914,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5053#issuecomment-407736504,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
Deployability,"Hi @Vzzarr ,. Thank you for reporting this. I've never heard of this happening before, but I suspect the difference is that you are using maven and we've only ever used gradle. @magicDGS @LeeTL1220 You both build downstream projects, have you ever seen this?. From what I can tell `com.github.fommil.netlib.all` is a POM only dependency, but it's not annotated as such in our generated POM. Gradle resolves it correctly, and then resolves it's transitive dependencies correctly, but maven seems to resolve it differently. . I've reproduced the issue locally, and it seems like it can be fixed by changing this line in our build file:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/62e339fb9150db19f80d4b48aed8d47608461690/build.gradle#L220. to specify the exact dependencies we want instead of using the all artifact. I'll open a pull request with that. There's an additional catch though, you're using the latest release to maven central, which is actually a very old version. We haven't been able to release newer versions to central because they depend on a snapshot of a fork of a google library that isn't released to central. We publish these to our artifactory server which can be resolved like any other maven repository. Would you be able to work with an artifactory dependency? If you can you can A) use the newer and better gatk, B) I won't have to backport this change on top of beta.2 . We're going to fix the problem of not being in central eventually ( certainly before 4.0 release... ) but until then resolving from our artifactory is probably the best bet. If you can't / don't want to use the artifactory releases, let me know and I can release a patch version to maven that fixes this problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3724#issuecomment-339056907:912,release,release,912,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3724#issuecomment-339056907,7,"['patch', 'release']","['patch', 'release', 'released', 'releases']"
Deployability,Hi @Wangchangsh ; Yes there is an update for this issue. We were able to recreate this problem in our hands and looks like there is a memory management issue somewhere in the GenomicsDB related code inside GenotypeGVCFs. . Our temporary solution until we make an updated release would be to convert imported genomicsDB instances to GVCF using . `gatk SelectVariants -V gendb://instancename -O GVCF_export.g.vcf.gz -R ref.fa -L whateverintervalusedinGDBimport`. and later using this GVCF file as input for the GenotypeGVCFs tool.

Deployability,"Hi @Yyx2626, I'm Geraldine, you may remember me from the Beijing training. It was great visiting your team! I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. . After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. . If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. . David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context.

Deployability,"Hi @cccnrc, glad you found this discussion interesting and apologies for the very late reply. Unfortunately, there hasn't been much movement on this front, as I think we decided that the current model sufficed. I think we are moving in a direction so that we can obviate the need for a separate step to fit global (e.g., depth) and per-contig (e.g., contig ploidy) parameters for each sample. Recall that this is only necessary because each gCNV genomic shard needs these quantities to perform inference, but cannot infer them from the data they are responsible for fitting (which typically covers less than a contig). We are looking to reimplement gCNV in a more modern inference framework that could allow us to do away with such sharding entirely. We could thus fit global/per-contig quantities of interest jointly with the rest of the gCNV model. The timeframe for this work may be relatively long (~year), but I think it'll be worth it. That said, I think a key takeaway from this work is that genotype priors can be more powerful for breaking degeneracies than contig-ploidy priors, so we will probably try to incorporate that insight in future work. To answer your questions:; 1) There are no additional results much further beyond what is shown above.; 2) You can see snippets/comparisons of the genotype and contig-ploidy prior file above. If you're just looking for information about the contig-ploidy prior table used in the current pipeline, see an example at https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360051304711-DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and feel free to modify it to be more/less strict as desired.; 3) Unfortunately I believe the samples discussed above are not publicly available.

Deployability,"Hi @fpbarthel,. You have a few options, but I think they would all require a bit of manual processing on your part. For example, you could use CollectReadCounts with your initial list of bins, but then you'd have to do the averaging step manually. Hopefully, it should not be too trouble to put together your own script to do this; however, since it is somewhat of a custom operation, it's unlikely we'll support it as a feature. In any case, note that the rest of the downstream tools in both our germline and somatic pipelines are only set up to work with integer counts. I don't know your reasons for wanting to average counts over multiple bins, but since 1) averages contain less information than the full resolution bins, 2) the BAM I/O to perform count collection is expensive (so we don't want to discard information during the CollectReadCounts step that we might need later), and 3) we want to build generative models of the counts, our philosophy is to always retain the integer counts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439892644:519,pipeline,pipelines,519,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439892644,1,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

Deployability,"Hi @pieterlukasse. This is a great question and somewhat timely. Funcotator hasn't gotten the attention it needs lately because the engineer who's most involved has been extremely busy with other very high priority projects. We intend to support it going forward but it's unclear if that means bug fixes and reactive support or if we're able to make major upgrades. We're currently in the middle of somewhat of a resource crunch, and we are actively planning how to prioritize our attention in the future. . I think if you're basically happy with features now, you should feel safe investing the time into an output parser. If there are major improvements you need I would wait a week or two and ask again then because we'll have more clarity about what we can do. . If you're interested I would consider contributing back your code the GATK core. There's some existing utility code that could probably help you, but there's a long standing gap in our tooling for users to make sense of the funcotations and we'd welcome improvements or new tools. @jonn-smith @droazen",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8154#issuecomment-1378997296:356,upgrade,upgrades,356,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8154#issuecomment-1378997296,1,['upgrade'],['upgrades']
Deployability,"Hi @ruslan-abasov,. I believe your GermlineCNVCaller results should have inherited the correct dictionary from the count files. The issue is you created some GermlineCNVCaller shards (e.g., shard 4) with inappropriately ordered intervals (since these were instead ordered w.r.t. to the idiosyncratic dictionary you attached). However, I think if you just reshard and rerun GermlineCNVCaller for any such shards, you may be able to reuse most of your results. For example, you could take your shard 4 interval list, which contains intervals from chr18, chr19, and chr1, and reshard these intervals into two shards: 4a containing chr18-19 intervals, and 4b containing chr1 intervals. After rerunning 4a and 4b through GermlineCNVCaller, you should be able to use PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls to stitch together shards 4b, 1, 2, 3, and 4a, since these will be ordered w.r.t. the correct dictionary from the count files (i.e, they will contain intervals in the order chr1, chr10-19). Of course, you will want not want to perform this exact procedure; you'll want to generalize it to whatever will yield the correct order for all 10 of your shards across all contigs. Again, this may be error prone and I can't guarantee that it will be successful, since I haven't tried it myself. I would personally just rerun the pipeline. You might be able to cut down on runtime by using smaller shards (I believe we typically shard the entire genome into far more than 10 shards, which we usually run in parallel) and making sure you set parameters appropriately for WGS. @mwalker174 has the most experience running on WGS and should be able to provide you the latest recommendations, or you might be able to find them by searching GitHub or the GATK Forums. Your point is well taken about failing earlier, and I think I've outlined the best strategy above. It is impossible to catch all possible errors early, but for some we can certainly fail before the GermlineCNVCaller step.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-720091802:1310,pipeline,pipeline,1310,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-720091802,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @tomwhite! The serializer registrations in ADAM shouldn't effect any GATK serialization, unless you're serializing classes from ADAM (such as `org.bdgenomics.format.avro.AlignmentRecord`); additionally, we haven't seen any performance issues with serialization in ADAM 0.23.0 outside of the GATK. We actually made a number of patches to eliminate logging in 0.23.0 (relative to 0.22.0), so I'd doubt that is the culprit. The one exception to this is logging when writing Parquet out to disk, which greatly increased sometime between ADAM 0.21.0 and 0.23.0, due to a change in Parquet versions upstream in Spark. However, this would only impact you if you were writing Parquet, and additionally this issue was resolved with the release of Spark 2.2.0, so you should see the logging go away with #4314. If I had to hypothesize anything, I'd suggest that the 2bit file change is the one thing that could be biting you. That said, we've been running with this 2bit file code quite frequently on AWS and Azure for at least the last 6 months using GATK HC on WES and WGS data and haven't seen any performance issues. I show that the changes in the 2bit file code between ADAM 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 are API compatible, so if you check out ADAM 0.23.0 and then `git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.11-0.20.0 adam-core/src/main/scala/org/bdgenomics/adam/util/TwoBitFile.scala` and build the ADAM JAR (and then package that jar into GATK), you should be able to test that hypothesis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897:329,patch,patches,329,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897,2,"['patch', 'release']","['patches', 'release']"

In the minimal example, we do not use PON. In the production pipeline, we use the exome PON file from: gs://gatk-best-practices/somatic-hg38/1000g_pon.hg38.vcf.gz as recommended here: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890631-Panel-of-Normals-PON-; In the production pipeline, we also use gnomAD 3.1.2, filtered for AF>0 and FILTER=PASS as ""germline resource"". Some more data from the production pipeline, just in case it could help. ; Since the PON is exome-only, we were not sure whether including the PON would improve the performance of our WGS workflow in the ""production pipeline"" with gatk version 4.1.7.0, so we ran experiments:; - calling without germline resource and without PON; - calling with germline resource only, without PON; - calling with both germline resource and PON.

Deployability,"Hi Karthik @kvn95ss ,. This isn't going to do what you want it to do if we implement it as you suggest. The latest GVCF formats try to preserve more annotation data so we can get better statistical power by using all mapping quality values (for example) rather than taking the median across all samples. As such, genomicsDB is going to return a value that isn't usable by VariantRecalibrator without going through GenotypeGVCFs to take the final mean and square root of the stored sum of the squared MQ values. GenomicsDB also won't calculate the FS or SOR values; it will only return the strand bias table. Finally, GenotypeGVCFs will apply a QUAL threshold to remove the lowest evidence variants so your final callset isn't riddled with false positives.

Deployability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready.

Deployability,"Hi! This issue is a duplicate of #7054 - under the hood a few changes need to be made to support arbitrary `FeatureTag`s. ; As gencode is updated they seem to be adding more `FeatureTag`s, which Funcotator doesn't expect. The fix is relatively straight-forward, but requires several other changes as well. Unfortunately there isn't a good workaround right now. As a side-note, the `getGencode.sh` script you referenced (and all scripts in that same folder: `scripts/funcotator/data_sources`) are not supported and are designed to be for internal use (I have a file in that folder to indicate this, but I'll admit it's not 100% clear). That said, `getGencode.sh` should work properly - the issue is in the GATK itself (specifically in `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.codecs.gtf.GencodeGtfTranscriptFeature` and associated classes).

Deployability,"Hi, ; for those looking to run containers within a multi-user HPC environment, running a container with default root privileges presents a potential data security risk. Adding something like :. RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash gatk; WORKDIR /home/gatk; USER gatk. to the Docker file would greatly reduce the risk and bring the current containers in line with general best practice, e.g https://medium.com/@mccode/processes-in-containers-should-not-run-as-root-2feae3f0df3b. There should be no downsides to running in this manner.

Deployability,"Hi, @jamesemery .I downloaded the `GTF` file for `basic gene annotation` in the CHR regions from gencode. The version I obtained was `Release 43 (GRCh38.p13)`. After making some modifications as follow, I managed to run SVAnnotate without encountering any errors. ; ```; sed 's/; tag ""Ensembl_canonical""//g' gencode.v43.basic.annotation.gtf|sed 's/; tag ""overlaps_pseudogene""//g'|sed 's/; tag ""readthrough_gene""//g'|sed 's/; tag ""artifactual_duplication""//g' > gencode.v43.basic.modified_annotation.gtf; ```; However, the tool still fails to provide meaningful annotation information.

Deployability,"Hi, I think this issue was driven by our use case. We have a GenomicsDBImport/GenotypeGVCFs pipeline that for efficient parallelisation purposes we would like to run on adjacent 10kb intervals. The problem is that we are interested in correctly calling spanning deletions that span across the interval boundaries. Here is an example of the first two variants of an interval starting at Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001; ; ```; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400001 . AG A,GG,CG 952.47 . AC=2,2,1; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400002 . GCCGAA *,ACCGAA,TCCGAA 236625 . AC=306,21,155; ```; ; And here are the same two variants, but this time from an interval starting before Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001:; ; ```; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400001 . AG *,A,GG,CG 952.47 . AC=304,1,2,1; Pf3D7_07_v3 1400002 . GCCGAA *,ACCGAA,TCCGAA 236625 . AC=306,21,155; ```; ; As you'll see, the first version is missing the spanning deletion at Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001. You'll also notice that the allele counts for the A allele are different between the two versions (2 vs 1). So for the interval Pf3D7_07_v3:1400001-1410000, we want the output to look like the second example above, not the first.; ; We are only interested in having calls for positions that lie within the interval, so in the above case we don't want to see any calls for position Pf3D7_07_v3:1400000 or earlier.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6335#issuecomment-567487326:92,pipeline,pipeline,92,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6335#issuecomment-567487326,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hm. Just yesterday we updated from TF 1.4 to 1.9. Although this makes it more compelling to switch the default to Intel-optimized, we may still have an issue for the reasons outlined in the previous PR (academic users, not all GCS zones guaranty AVX hardware, and its still unclear to me if Travis, which uses both GCS and EC2, makes such a guaranty). It [sounds like](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/18689) the failure mode is to crash. For running inference at least (training may be a different story), we may need something better.

Deployability,"Hmm, looks like we lose events 1 and 3 with CollectReadCounts at 250bp using analogous ModelSegments parameters. However, I experimented with tweaking the segmentation to work on the copy ratios (rather than the log2 copy ratios), which seems to recover them. Although one of the goals of having evaluations backed by SV truth sets is to tune such parameters/methods, I'm beginning to think that SV integration might benefit from using the CNV tools in a more customized pipeline---especially if maximizing sensitivity at resolutions of ~100bp jointly with breakpoint evidence is the goal. For example, you might imagine a tool that directly uses CNV backend code to collect coverage over regions specified by `-L`, builds a PoN, denoises, and segments on the fly. Or we can put together a custom WDL optimized for sensitivity.

Deployability,"How much does count collection cost at the desired bin size? How does this compare to bincov? Perhaps we could eliminate one of these steps if redundant. Note that the read counts are read once and stored in memory, so unless this takes a significant amount of time, then indexing is probably not the highest priority here (although I agree it would be nice to have in general). One related issue, as you mention, is file localization---since each shard only operates on a portion of the counts in each sample, it is a bit wasteful to localize the whole file. But how much does file localization cost? I can't imagine that it is the lowest hanging fruit. One of the more important issues, which you also mention, is optimizing parameters for inference. This includes not only the minimum number of epochs for training, but also things like the learning rate, annealing schedule, iterations per epoch, conditions for epoch convergence, etc. I'll be talking about how to tune these inference parameters---as well as other things in the pipeline---at the next BSV meeting.

Deployability,"I did a simple experiment and changed the version of Java used in the non-Docker (""17"", although again I'm not sure what this actually resolves to) to that used in the Docker (17.0.1+12). This causes both non-Docker and Docker tests to now fail, rather than just the Docker tests; see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8174#issuecomment-1402974502. Moreover, the test failures produce exactly the same discrepant numerical results. I think we can probably conclude that the expected test results were generated with ""17"" and that changing to 17.0.1+12 generates different results. This is not too unreasonable; see the Slack thread linked in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8111#issuecomment-1331407680, for example, which shows that we might be getting into pretty hairy territory and that even changes to things like how HotSpot Intrinsics are implemented in each JVM can cause the numerical differences we see here. So perhaps we can either 1) change the Docker version to the version corresponding to ""17"" or 2) change the non-Docker version to 17.0.1+12 and update the expected results?.

Deployability,"I did some more work on the broadcast approach to see how feasible it would be, and found that Spark Dataflow made two unnecessary copies of the data (now fixed: https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow/pull/60), which caused OOM errors when trying to broadcast the 3GB reference data. With this fixed, I ran a [pipeline called JoinReferencesDataflow](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/dataflow/pipelines/JoinReferencesDataflow.java) on a small cluster that broadcasts the reference as a dataflow view. The code is a modified version of CountReadsDataflow that simply sends the view, and then doesn't use it, so we can see the cost of doing a broadcast (See the rest of the code in this branch: https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/tree/hadoop-references). JoinReferencesDataflow took 2 min 25s to run, of which 18s were for reading the reference from the local filesystem in the driver. For comparison, CountReadsDataflow took 17s on the same cluster. So broadcasting the reference takes less than 2 minutes. Note that this was just for one task, but Spark has [an efficient protocol for sending broadcast variables](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~agearh/cs267.sp10/files/mosharaf-spark-bc-report-spring10.pdf), which scales well with the number of nodes, so the approach looks feasible. Having said all that, we might still want to use the sharding approach, in order to share more code between the Google and Spark dataflow implementations. One way this could work would be to generalize `RefAPISource` and `RefAPIMetadata` to support reading reference data from a [ReferenceHadoopSource](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/dataflow/datasources/ReferenceHadoopSource.java), which is in line with @droazen's last comment.

This change means we definitely have to build it every time. . It feels like we need something more sophisticated. Instead of stamping the conda environment with the gatk version that matches it, maybe we should be stamping the gatk jar and the conda environment with some version based on the conda.env? Maybe we can do something like taking the md5 of the conda.yml and pushing that into both the jar manifest and the conda environment in some way?

Deployability,"I have no problems whatsoever with the code, but I do have some concerns about the design:. In the SV group's pipeline, we distribute this multi-gig file from its home in the cloud once at cluster-creation time, and then reuse it for multiple client executions. There are no superfluous copies lying about anywhere, and no redundant copying operations. We can give it any name we wish, and put it anywhere we desire (except that the path must be the same on every worker). This code, if I'm reading it correctly, will redistribute the file from a non-permanent home on the master's local file system or on the HDFS (to which it must be copied redundantly at least once per cluster instantiation), and then it will further be redundantly copied to a temporary location on each worker's local file system with every client execution. I don't know if that's overhead that we can live with, or whether that might prevent us from writing clients with brief execution times. I'm just opening the issue for discussion. We also lose a little flexibility in that the image must live in the same directory as the reference, though I don't think that's a serious drawback -- it's a perfectly logical place for it. However, since we're just appending a fixed extension ("".img"") to the reference name we can only have one image file per reference, which may be a problem because different images need to be created for different versions of bwa and for various options such as the list of alt contigs. We can handle the first problem by insisting that all clients on a particular cluster stick to one version of bwa, which is probably a good idea, anyway, but I think we're stuck if clients need to specify various alt contig lists. It might be better to provide a default path of ""ref-name""+"".img"", but allow that default to be overridden. Also, just to twist the knife a bit, it's too bad we never reviewed my PR for gatk-bwamem-jni, which version-stamped the images for safety.

For the aim of this issue, this will be useful for setting documentation guidelines in each of the sub-modules: e.g., example-code should be documented for developers, but not for the final user; experimental module should have the `@Experimental` barclay annotation in every `@DocumentedFeature`; etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346291829:180,integrat,integration,180,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346291829,6,"['integrat', 'pipeline']","['integration', 'pipeline', 'pipelines']"

Deployability,"I think changes in 4.2.4.1 are exposing an issue, but I think @eriqande is right that the issue isn't with GenomicsDB. The change was that previously GATK wasn't correctly passing the `--max-alternate-allele` argument to GenomicsDB, but now that it is doing so it makes it more likely that some sites don't contain fields like PL (dependent on number of possible genotypes). It looks like the AF calculation used to ignore sites if they didn't have likelihoods, but has now been updated slightly to also allow sites with GQ or sites where any alleles are called+nonref+not symbolic. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/caa48f98c8207b688db6ee35fead3eafb7219e38/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/GenotypeUtils.java#L139-L141. Possibly that condition needs to be tweaked? @ldgauthier might be the best person to ask. As for this working with previous versions, that is only because the `--max-alternate-alleles` wasn't being passed to GenomicsDB correctly. if you want to revert to that behavior you can set `--max-alternate-alleles` to `50` (which is what GenomicsDB defaults to).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941:479,update,updated,479,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941,1,['update'],['updated']

I divided the PRs for the `IndelRealignment` into 4 different sections for better review (2 components of indel-realignment, `RealignerTargetCreator`and `IndelRealignment`). This strategy is because I dissected the pipeline into the easy `RealignerTargetCreator` to found regions worth to look at (this could be marked as experimental/beta before the indel-realignment is in) and the more complicated and component-based `IndelRealigner` (the same as with other tools, this can be marked as experimental/beta until a really good coverage is achieved - in the meantime, I have some test with the current data in the repository and the GATK3 counterpart). There are two parts that are usable outside `IndelRealigner` that are worthy to separate into two commits, and might be useful for other tools/downstream projects: `ConstrainedMateFixingManager` and `NWaySAMFileWriter`. That's the reason of making the port in split PRs. One option can be to have the PRs open, and reviewed independently without acceptance until every component is ready.

Deployability,"I think that this is a nice feature (at least for me) and not a bug. For example, if in GATK someone runs a tool with `-RF read_filters.args`, then the pipeline cannot be reproduced in a different dataset unless the file is accessible. I can understand that it could be also nice to preserve the `-RF read_filters.args` to be able to modify the file an re-run the tool with different parameters, but for me the purpose of storing the command line in the header or other places is keep track of the exact params that I used: if a file is modified, then it is impossible to trace the params. For input files, this is expected (if the input has changed, it is expected that the result change), but for arguments it shouldn't be the case (independently of the file changing, the tool was running with exactly that parameters).

If you're not using hdfs I think you won't have any problems including 22, but I'm afraid we can't upgrade our default version without some work. .

Deployability,"I would like to reiterate that the one code path in ADAM that is. 1. changed between 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 and; 2. that is used in both the GATK BQSR and HC engines. is the two bit file parsing and extraction engine. The main commit that changed in that code path was https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/commit/1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810, which reverts cleanly on ADAM trunk. There are also some changes in the `ReferenceRegion` class, they appear to be mostly cosmetic, but this necessitated changing one parameter from `null` to `Strand.INDEPENDENT` in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/8a366c7ba570c61338f7109b86c3284b80d5cf47. The GATK does one lookup into the TwoBitFile (which creates one ReferenceRegion along the way) per read during BQSR and two per assembly region during HC, so this code is inside your inner loop. Again, all it should take to test this hypothesis is:. ```; git clone git@github.com:bigdatagenomics/adam.git; cd adam; git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.10-0.23.0; git revert 1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810; mvn install -DskipTests; ```.

Deployability,"I'm not sure what proportion of users leverage the incremental import functionality...it wasn't available when GenomicsDBImport was first made available, but has been around for ~3 years now. As for workspaces with whole chromosomes -- there is no requirement or performance benefits to using whole chromosomes. As you say, subsetting a chromosome to smaller regions will work and make the import and query parallelizable. (if you remember where the advice about whole chromosomes came from, let us know. That might be something that needs to be updated/clarified). Many small contigs does add overhead to import though and, till recently, multiple contigs couldn't be imported together (i.e., each contig would have it's own folder under the GenomicsDB workspace - which gets inefficient with many small contigs). For WGS, probably the best way to create the GenomicsDBImport interval list is to split based on where there are consecutive N's in the reference genome (maybe using [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#ScatterIntervalsByNs)) and/or regions that you are blacklisting. I think you suggested that some of the blacklisted regions were especially gnarly - maybe ploidy or high alternate allele count? - depending on the frequency of those, we may save a bit on space/memory requirements. That may address your concern about overlap between variants and import intervals. In general, any variant that starts in a specified import interval will show up in a query to that workspace.

Deployability,"I'm stepping into the 7 remaining test failures in the debugger, and I think they may just be fixed by overwriting the actual output of `GenotypeGVCFsIntegrationTest.testEntireVariant` onto the expected output for all the forced output test cases. However, this exercise has revealed some other changes:. `GenotypeGVCFsEngine.callRegion` contains the line `final VariantContext mergedVC = merger.merge(variantsToProcess, loc, ref.getBase(), !outputNonVariants, false)`. Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call). Once you do that, could you check whether `removeNonRefAndUnusedAltAlleles` is still necessary?

Deployability,"I've been thinking about this literal edge case. We now have metagenomic pipelines that are meant to align data to presumably extremely small references (bacteria, infectious agents, e.g. viri). These organisms have a different expectation for mutation/variant rates that my synthetic data could represent. I am unfamiliar with the details of the metagenomics pipelines except that it aligns reads to a giant conglomerate of different organisms. I forget whether the pipeline actually produces an alignment BAM or just a list of organisms--perhaps @mwalker174 could inform us. On the forum, we've had a few cases where we encourage folks to use our tools even when they work in other nonmammalian organisms such as bacteria. However, knowing how our assembler handles data at the edges of contigs, and how variants that are close together trigger alternate assumptions, e.g. the presence of an indel as I learned from @droazen, then I'd like to know how I should actually be informing our nonmammalian researchers.

You will also have to setup an SSH key to root on the cluster, which can be done with the command `gcloud compute ssh` and set the ""SSH_KEY"" variable in the config file to point to the google_compute_engine file in roots .ssh directory (public keys should have automatically been distributed to the other nodes). .

Deployability,"In the WGS SV pipeline, for deletions and duplications that the pipeline believes to be biallelic we do the following:. - ALT: `<DEL>` or `<DUP>`; - SVTYPE: `DEL` or `DUP`; - GT: `0/0` or `0/1` or `1/1`. We currently report depth based copy number and quality for these variants in custom format fields `RD_CN` and `RD_GQ` if they are available; we could possibly move those values to the standard `CN` and `CNQ`, but there is some complexity in how to handle events detected by paired end and split reads without good read depth support; ie those under 1kb or so depending on our depth binning size and the coverage. Our depth genotyping module makes estimates of copy number for these sites but sometimes these can be very inaccurate so at the moment we prefer not to report total copy number in those fields. Probably what we _should_ do is fill in CN with 0, 1, or 2 based on the genotype we emitted and set CNQ to the value we computed for GQ. For multiallelic CNVs (i.e. sites where our model is not sure that the variant is bi-allelic) we write:. - ALT: `<CNV>`; - SVTYPE: `CNV`; - GT and GQ: `.`; - CN and CNQ: estimate of total (diploid/unphased) copy number and quality of the depth evidence. I think there are some tradeoffs in completely characterizing the evidence for and quality of each call and enabling easy searching across the whole VCF without having to parse and understand the entire record. Older versions of our pipeline used to put the diploid copy number of the event into the GT field, I think similarly to what's being described above. This is incorrect VCF -- GT values should be indices into the allele list for the variant, and should be a list of length equal to the ploidy. . My view is that if you can confidently infer the alleles present at the site in the sample set you should use a GT value of the form `0/1`, and if you don't know or aren't interested in trying to infer them you should use CN for total copy number and CNQ for the quality.

Deployability,"Interesting! Thanks for generating these. I am already convinced by #4519 we should at least switch over to a ‘CollectReadCounts’ strategy for initial evaluations. A few comments:. -I’m guessing that the equal insert size and uniform sampling is enhancing many of these artifacts to a level that we probably don’t see in the real world. Can we take a look at some real-world examples?. -Same goes for the fact that homs will be unlikely. -Not sure about the dropouts. Might be worth running without SNPs as a confounding factor. -How flexible is SVGen? Might be worth putting together a more realistic simulated data set. Any chance @MartonKN might be able to use it to cook up some realistic tumor data?. -I don’t recall having a `CollectBaseCallCoverage` type tool in beta—which tool are you thinking of? On a related note, it seems there is some demand to port `DepthOfCoverage` from GATK3. However, I’d prefer that we roll a CNV-specific version of the tool even if it does get ported. In any case, I think along with findings from the other issue, we should issue a quick PR for `CollectReadCounts` and go ahead to change the `CollectCounts` WDL task to call it—it’s for this very reason that the task is named generically! @sooheelee note that we may have to update the tutorials, etc. at some point, but perhaps the right time will be until all evaluations are more complete. Speaking of which, this PR should not delay getting the first round of automated evaluations up and running. Again, the whole point of those is to have a reproducible baseline metric against which we can easily experiment with and adopt these sorts of changes.

Given this issue, and the unrelated but evolving requirement that we have more than a single conda yml (we need a separate one with the intel tensorflow version that supports acceleration on intel hardware), I'm going to make the following changes:. Add a single conda template and a gradle task that generates the two (nearly but not quite identical) yml files as part of the build. These will be stored in the build directory with the python package archive, so the yml file no longer has to specify a path to the zip (which we previously had to strip when we included the file in the zip/tar distribution). The zip and yml files will be copied into the tar/zip distributions as was previously done.; Add a gradle target that creates/updates the local conda dev.

The parentheses are confounding but not relevant - the failing case above that uses no parens references `MQRandSum` (sic); the succeeding case references `MQRankSum`. Separating the expression components into separate filter expression arguments **does** change the results because each expression is evaluated individually and serially, so a reference to a missing value in one expression results in a `PASS`, but the subsequent expression results in the filter being applied if it meets the criteria.

Since the variation is inside the padding, it seems safe to ignore. Increasing padding resolves the issue, alhtough this is at the cost of runtime and should not be necessary. For example, suppose we have a ref haplotype ABCDD, where A, B, and C represent sequences of, say, 100 bases and D is a sequence of 50 bases. Suppose further that A and DD are the padding. Then the cigar of an alt haplotype ABCD gets aligned as a 350 base match that doesn't span the full padded reference region, leading to the error.

Deployability,It should also be noted that the current behavior of the HaplotypeCaller on low base quality reads could be better. Specifically in the PairHMM there is code that explicitly caps the base qualities for every base in every read to be at most the reads Mapping Quality. Empirically this doesn't seem to sufficiently penalize low MQ reads in the HMM scores which is part of the reason for the hard cuttoff. In the upcoming DRAGEN-GATK release code we disable this particular behavior and instead apply a secondary genotyping algorithm in the genotyper that attempts to partition the evidence by mapping quality and adjust the score if there is a significant difference in MQ between reads supporting the various alleles.

Deployability,"It won't be able to run any faster than BWA mem does with a similar number of cores, since it is essentially just running bwamem. It's potentially faster as part of a spark pipeline so you can load and process data once instead of saving the data to disk and reloading it repeatedly. . The complete list of spark configuration parameters is available on the [spark docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/configuration.html). Many of them are not relevant in local mode. From what I understand the local mode is going to execute as a single executor with the number of cores specified in the `local[#]` block ( or the total number of system threads if it's set to `*`) It will use the available memory that java is configured with. I'm pretty sure it's ignoring the memory and configuration parameters you've set. Those will be relevant if you configure a stand alone spark cluster (potentially one running exclusively on your local machine). . Our spark tools are not being actively developed for the most part. We've moved away from them to use single threaded tools widely sharded and managed by cromwell.

Deployability,"Java implementation of segmentation is now in the sl_wgs_segmentation dev branch, with a few simple unit tests. I'll expand on these and add tests for denoising in the future, but for now we have a working revised pipeline up through segmentation.

Here's a particularly noisy exome:. CBS found 1398 segments:; ![cbs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/30165095-cdf6251a-93ac-11e7-91fb-dcc8f48fe07f.png).

The number of segments can similarly be controlled in WGS. WGS runtime is ~7min for 250bp bins, ~30s of which is TSV reading, and there is one more spot in my implementation that could stand a bit of optimization, which might bring the runtime down. In contrast, I kicked off CBS 45 minutes ago, and it's still running... @LeeTL1220 this is probably ready to hand off to you for some WDL writing and preliminary evaluation. ; Although I can't guarantee that there aren't bugs, I ran about ~80 exomes with no problem.

Deployability,"Just a reminder tech leads @droazen @cwhelan @samuelklee @ldgauthier @vruano @yfarjoun @LeeTL1220 @cmnbroad , that the tool doc updates need to be done, reviewed and merged as soon as possible. Please assign your people tools to update if you haven't already and let us know the status of the changes in the STATUS column of [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/spreadsheets/d/19SvP6DHyXewm8Cd47WsM3NUku_czP2rkh4L_6fd-Nac/edit?usp=sharing). Please prioritize tools that are featured in any Best Practice workflow. The forum docs revolve mostly around Best Practice workflows. **@chandrans and I have to then take your new kebab parameters and _edit the entirety of the forum documents_ to represent the new syntax and WE HAVE LESS THAN 9 WORKING DAYS TO DO SO as of today 12/4.** @chandrans is leaving for the holidays starting December 15 and will not be back until near the release on January 9. Once she goes on holiday, I take over her forum duties, which is a full-time job. We really need to have these changes now so we can start working on updating forum docs as the updates are merged to master. Thank you for your work towards these improvements. Again, although I cannot help in changing code, and do not understand the intricacies, I have brought in homemade cheesecake towards fueling your work towards these updates.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-349040010:128,update,updates,128,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-349040010,6,"['a/b', 'release', 'update']","['a/broadinstitute', 'release', 'update', 'updates']"
Deployability,"Just an idea: it will be nice to propagate the configuration from `Main` to the tools, and obtain from it the packages/classes to include in the command line tools (this is one of the things that I implemented in #2322).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3126#issuecomment-309680944:47,configurat,configuration,47,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3126#issuecomment-309680944,1,['configurat'],['configuration']
Deployability,"Just finished switching over all of the CNV tools to fail early if directories are not writeable---or do not exist and cannot be created---only to realize that this behavior is inconsistent with that of Picard IntervalListTools (which is used in the gCNV pipeline). That tool fails early if the output directory is not writeable or does not exist, and although there is a code path later that suggests that output directories should be created, it is not reached due to this early fail. It might be that this inconsistency was introduced in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1208 and I did not catch it in my PR review. @yfarjoun any opinions what the intended behavior should be? Are there any conventions for Picard tools in general?. Perhaps we could enforce this at the engine level (maybe checks that are triggered by annotations such as suggested in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/141, if possible)? But this would only work for GATK tools and would still rely on the diligence of developers. In any case, I'll decide on and document a convention for the CNV tools, but I think it might be a quixotic dream to enforce consistent behavior---especially without breaking things downstream which may rely on existing, inconsistent behavior...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4825#issuecomment-469067676:255,pipeline,pipeline,255,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4825#issuecomment-469067676,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
