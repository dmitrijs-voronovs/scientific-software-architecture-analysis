You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures.

### Example 2
**Content:** [[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]] — describes syntax for matching values using format specifiers like %u, %d, or %x.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is purely technical specification of syntax with no natural language explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.

2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1
**Content:** Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: Consists entirely of build logs and test failures.

### Example 2
**Content:** [[#%<fmtspec>, <constraint> <expr>]] — describes syntax for matching values using format specifiers like %u, %d, or %x.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is purely technical specification of syntax with no natural language explanation.

### Example 3
**Content:** I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Natural language explanation of performance trade-offs.

### Example 4
**Content:** The MemoryDef structure now keeps two operands: the defining access and the optimized access. This change allows faster walking of Def chains and enables caching.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Explains technical design changes in natural language with rationale.

### Example 5
**Content:** We propose SPECTER, a document-level embedding model trained using citation graphs. It improves scientific document classification without task-specific fine-tuning.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: Describes an academic NLP model in natural language.
