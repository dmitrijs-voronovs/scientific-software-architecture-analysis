### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:

- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**

1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** deployability

**2. Attribute Description:** Deployability measures the ease and speed with which a new version of the system can be delivered to and installed by its users, including the time taken for updates.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on infrastructure, automation, and processes related to release and installation. Strong examples will mention build scripts, package managers (like pip or conda), Dockerfiles, or CI/CD pipelines. Distinguish this from 'Modifiability', which is about the ease of changing the code itself.

**4. Content to Analyze:** sc.pp.scale(adata) generates NaN error; I encountered this error when using data with a relatively small number of cells (~2,600). I have not encountered this error with my previous data with more cells (>10,000). ![sc pp scale_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35155633/34744836-6f325a80-f586-11e7-963f-34d14c1e1399.png).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on preventing physical harm or catastrophic failure. Strong examples will relate to systems where a failure could cause real-world harm (e.g., medical, automotive) and describe a mechanism to prevent that specific harm.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Pick a type to identify incoming block values as we construct SSA. We can't use anything more robust than an integer unfortunately, as SSAUpdater expects to zero-initialize the type.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",False,"The content's primary intent is describing functionality. It explains what the code does by mentioning 'incoming block values' and 'construct SSA', but does not explicitly state why this design choice relates to a non-functional goal like safety."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

I'm thinking of AST matchers vs. AST visitors as a roughly. similar situation: matchers are not omnipotent, but they're so nice. * Separation between core and checkers is usually quite strange. Once we have. shared state traits, i generally wouldn't mind having region store or range. constraint manager as checkers (though it's probably not worth it to transform. them - just a mood). The main thing to avoid here would be the situation when. the checker overwrites stuff written by the core because it thinks it has a. better idea what's going on, so the core should provide a good default behavior. * Yeah, i totally care about performance as well, and if i try to implement. approach, i'd make sure it's good. **Artem:**. > Approach (2): We could teach the Store to scan itself for bindings to. > metadata-symbolic-based regions during scanReachableSymbols() whenever. > a region turns out to be reachable. This requires no work on checker side,. > but it sounds performance-heavy. Nope, this approach is wrong. Metadata symbols may become out-of-date: when the. object changes, metadata symbols attached to it aren't changing (because symbols. simply don't change). The same metadata may have different symbols to denote its. value in different moments of time, but at most one of them represents the. actual metadata value. So we'd be escaping more stuf

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** performance

**2. Attribute Description:** Performance is a system's ability to meet its timing requirements, encompassing its time-based response to events and its efficiency in resource usage under specified conditions.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on speed, latency, throughput, and resource usage. Strong examples will explicitly mention speed (e.g., 'faster'), time (e.g., 'reduces latency'), or resource usage (e.g., 'uses less memory').

**4. Content to Analyze:** Okay the base pointers match, so we have [c1+r] vs [c2+r]. Check to see if the load and store actually overlap.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** performance

**2. Attribute Description:** Performance is a system's ability to meet its timing requirements, encompassing its time-based response to events and its efficiency in resource usage under specified conditions.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on speed, latency, throughput, and resource usage. Strong examples will explicitly mention speed (e.g., 'faster'), time (e.g., 'reduces latency'), or resource usage (e.g., 'uses less memory').

For non-PIE binaries the preferred and profiled segment addresses should be equal and this is a no-op.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** usability

**2. Attribute Description:** Usability is concerned with how easily users can accomplish desired tasks and the kind of user support the system provides to facilitate their effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on the end-user experience. Strong examples will describe something that makes the software easier for a human to use, such as a clearer user interface, a more helpful error message, or a more intuitive workflow.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Update the edge to point directly to the correct GUID.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content to analyze is: Update the edge to point directly to the correct GUID. This sentence describes a specific action that developers must take regarding code configuration or data management. It does not explicitly explain why this design choice enhances usability (e.g., how it simplifies user interaction).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

Strong examples will mention build scripts, package managers (like pip or conda), Dockerfiles, or CI/CD pipelines. Distinguish this from 'Modifiability', which is about the ease of changing the code itself.

**4. Content to Analyze:** ing extra since they are normally translated to Python primitive. types on access and hence their address cannot be taken. For that. purpose, there is the `AddressOf()` function. As an example:. ``` {.cpp}. from ROOT import TFile, TTree. from ROOT import gROOT, AddressOf. gROOT.ProcessLine(. struct MyStruct { Int_t fMyInt1; Int_t fMyInt2; Int_t fMyInt3; Char_t fMyCode[4]; }; );. from ROOT import MyStruct. mystruct = MyStruct(). f = TFile('mytree.root','RECREATE'). tree = TTree('T','Just A Tree'). tree.Branch('myints',mystruct,'MyInt1/I:MyInt2:MyInt3'). tree.Branch('mycode',AddressOf(mystruct,'fMyCode'),'MyCode/C'). for i in range(0,10):. mystruct.fMyInt1 = i. mystruct.fMyInt2 = i*i. mystruct.fMyInt3 = i*i*i. mystruct.fMyCode = %03d % i note string assignment. tree.Fill(). f.Write(). f.Close(). ```. The C++ class is defined through the `gROOT.ProcessLine()` call, and. note how the `AddressOf()` function is used for data members of built-in. type. Most of the above is for ROOT version 5.02 and later only. For. older releases, and without further support, here is an example as to. how you can get hold of a pointer-to-pointer to a ROOT object:. ``` {.cpp}. h = TH1F(). addressofobject = array('i',[h.IsA().DynamicCast(h.IsA(),h)]). ```. Using Your Own Classes. A user's own classes can be accessed after loading, either directly or. indirectly, the library that contains the dictionary. One easy way of. obtaining such a library, is by using ACLiC:. ``` {.cpp}. $ cat MyClass.C. class MyClass {. public:. MyClass(int value = 0) {. m_value = value;. }. void SetValue(int value) {. m_value = value;. }. int GetValue() {. return m_value;. }. private:. int m_value;. };. $ echo .L MyClass.C+ | root.exe -b. [...]. Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC>: creating shared library [..]/./MyClass_C.so. $. ```. Then you can use it, for example, like so:. ``` {.cpp}. from ROOT import gSystem. load library with MyClass dictionary. gSystem.Load('MyClass_C'). get MyClass from ROOT. from ROOT

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",False,"The content to analyze is technical documentation for software development involving C++ code generation from Python scripts. However, upon analysis of Step 2: Intent vs. Quality Attribute, the primary intent appears to be describing functionality (how to use ROOT and its features) rather than explaining why certain design choices were made in relation to a non-functional goal like deployability. The examples provided are about how to perform specific tasks using ROOT's C++ interface, which falls under 'Modifiability' or other functional aspects, not directly addressing the ease of deployment."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content describes an issue with testing by mentioning that tests were passing through a function (`rangesToTuples`) that obscured the state of `TreeRange` objects.

- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** modifiability

**2. Attribute Description:** Modifiability refers to the ease with which changes, such as adding, deleting, or modifying functionality, quality attributes, capacity, or technology, can be made to a system, ideally involving the fewest distinct elements.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code structure that makes future changes easier. Strong examples will mention refactoring, decoupling, modularity, or using a design pattern for the explicit purpose of simplifying future development.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Class responsible for emitting a DWARF v5 Accelerator Table. The only public function is emit(), which performs the actual emission. A callback abstracts the logic to provide a CU index for a given entry.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** The liverange splitting logic sometimes produces bundles of copies when subregisters are involved. Expand these into a sequence of copy instructions after processing the last in the bundle. Does not update LiveIntervals which we shouldn't need for this instruction anymore.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,The content describes a specific design change in code processing that simplifies testing by avoiding unnecessary updates to LiveIntervals. It explicitly states the 'why' behind the logic change: to make testing easier without affecting other parts of the system.

- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

For example, if the cell groups are clusters, then one might be interested in examining the fraction of each cluster that originates from each batch of cells or each patient sample. This function also enables ordering of the groups according to a specific value (e.g., a patient number or batch ID) or by agglomerative clustering. An example of ordering the groups based on agglomerative clustering is shown below:. ![image](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/assets/5004419/bfde8173-4f0d-483f-b37e-849446b65153). The function supplies an argument to specify whether the dendrogram should or should not be plotted. Please let me know if this feature is of interest and if so, what else needs to be adjusted or fixed prior to merging. Thanks! Matt.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

**1. Quality Attribute:** deployability

**2. Attribute Description:** Deployability measures the ease and speed with which a new version of the system can be delivered to and installed by its users, including the time taken for updates.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on infrastructure, automation, and processes related to release and installation. Strong examples will mention build scripts, package managers (like pip or conda), Dockerfiles, or CI/CD pipelines. Distinguish this from 'Modifiability', which is about the ease of changing the code itself.

**4. Content to Analyze:** [WIP] dev docs; This PR contains a work in progress version of development docs. I would like to have an initial version of this in the next release. Right now we just have [CONTRIBUTING.md](), but this not particularly discoverable, complete, or up to date.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

1512,modifiability,The stats are computed per module and will all be merged in the binary. Importing the metadata will cause duplication of the stats.,"
You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** modifiability

**2. Attribute Description:** Modifiability refers to the ease with which changes, such as adding, deleting, or modifying functionality, quality attributes, capacity, or technology, can be made to a system, ideally involving the fewest distinct elements.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code structure that makes future changes easier. Strong examples will mention refactoring, decoupling, modularity, or using a design pattern for the explicit purpose of simplifying future development.

**4. Content to Analyze:** The stats are computed per module and will all be merged in the binary. Importing the metadata will cause duplication of the stats.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** testability

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Parameter that's used as generics in the context. For example template parameters.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

It supports mapping an arbitrary range of bytes to an. arbitrary other object. The StringMap implementation uses a quadratically-probed hash table, where the. buckets store a pointer to the heap allocated entries (and some other stuff). The entries in the map must be heap allocated because the strings are variable. length. The string data (key) and the element object (value) are stored in the. same allocation with the string data immediately after the element object. This container guarantees the ``(char*)(&Value+1)`` points to the key string. for a value. The StringMap is very fast for several reasons: quadratic probing is very cache. efficient for lookups, the hash value of strings in buckets is not recomputed. when looking up an element, StringMap rarely has to touch the memory for. unrelated objects when looking up a value (even when hash collisions happen),. hash table growth does not recompute the hash values for strings already in the. table, and each pair in the map is store in a single allocation (the string data. is stored in the same allocation as the Value of a pair). StringMap also provides query methods that take byte ranges, so it only ever. copies a string if a value is inserted into the table.

**4. Content to Analyze:** en. long, expensive to copy, etc. StringMap is a specialized container designed to. cope with these issues. It supports mapping an arbitrary range of bytes to an. arbitrary other object. The StringMap implementation uses a quadratically-probed hash table, where the. buckets store a pointer to the heap allocated entries (and some other stuff). The entries in the map must be heap allocated because the strings are variable. length. The string data (key) and the element object (value) are stored in the. same allocation with the string data immediately after the element object. This container guarantees the ``(char*)(&Value+1)`` points to the key string. for a value. The StringMap is very fast for several reasons: quadratic probing is very cache. efficient for lookups, the hash value of strings in buckets is not recomputed. when looking up an element, StringMap rarely has to touch the memory for. unrelated objects when looking up a value (even when hash collisions happen),. hash table growth does not recompute the hash values for strings already in the. table, and each pair in the map is store in a single allocation (the string data. is stored in the same allocation as the Value of a pair). StringMap also provides query methods that take byte ranges, so it only ever. copies a string if a value is inserted into the table. StringMap iteration order, however, is not guaranteed to be deterministic, so. any uses which require that should instead use a std::map. .. _dss_indexmap:. llvm/ADT/IndexedMap.h. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. IndexedMap is a specialized container for mapping small dense integers (or. values that can be mapped to small dense integers) to some other type. It is. internally implemented as a vector with a mapping function that maps the keys. to the dense integer range. This is useful for cases like virtual registers in the LLVM code generator: they. have a dense mapping that is offset by a compile-time constant (the first. virtual register ID). .. _dss_densemap:

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

Value *VariableExprAST::codegen() {. // Look this variable up in the function. AllocaInst *A = NamedValues[Name];. if (!A). return LogErrorV(""Unknown variable name"");. // Load the value. return Builder->CreateLoad(A->getAllocatedType(), A, Name.c_str());. }. As you can see, this is pretty straightforward. Now we need to update. the things that define the variables to set up the alloca. We'll start. with ``ForExprAST::codegen()`` (see the `full code listing <#id1>`_ for. the unabridged code):. .. code-block:: c++. Function *TheFunction = Builder->GetInsertBlock()->getParent();. // Create an alloca for the variable in the entry block. AllocaInst *Alloca = CreateEntryBlockAlloca(TheFunction, VarName);. // Emit the start code first, without variable in scope. Value *StartVal = Start->codegen();. if (!StartVal). return nullptr;. // Store the value into the alloca. Builder->CreateStore(StartVal, Alloca);. ... // Compute the end condition. Value *EndCond = End->codegen();. if (!EndCond). return nullptr;. // Reload, increment, and restore the alloca. This handles the case where. // the body of the loop mutates the variable. 

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

When TFileMerger is given multiple files, the first of which doesn't have any branches in it, the merged output file will not have any branches either.

As a follow-up of https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8947, it would be nice to have a CMake flag that allows you to turn on the building of the Doxygen documentation within a normal build. Right now, it has to be done manually in the source directory. Optional: share how it could be improved. In addition, cmake Options can be easily used to tune the input files, see https://aliceo2group.github.io/advanced/doxygen.html, rather than manually having to edit the Doxyfile as indicated in https://root.cern/for_developers/doxygen/#how-to-generate-the-doxygen-documentation. Some flags like:. ```. BUILD_DOCS [OFF]. BUILD_DOCS_CORE [ON]. BUILD_DOCS_GRAF2D [OFF]. BUILD_DOCS_QHP [OFF]. ... ```. with the configurable QHP generation, see, https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8781. and then calling:. `doxygen_add_docs(...)` with all the variables correctly set to generate the proper Doxyfile.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

**1. Quality Attribute:** security

**2. Attribute Description:** Security is the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorised access or manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability for legitimate users.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on protection against malicious actors. Strong examples will explicitly mention a security threat (e.g., injection attack, unauthorized access) or a security mechanism (e.g., encryption, input sanitization, authentication).

**4. Content to Analyze:** erence guide; Explain what you would like to see improved. As a follow-up of https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8947, it would be nice to have a CMake flag that allows you to turn on the building of the Doxygen documentation within a normal build. Right now, it has to be done manually in the source directory. Optional: share how it could be improved. In addition, cmake Options can be easily used to tune the input files, see https://aliceo2group.github.io/advanced/doxygen.html, rather than manually having to edit the Doxyfile as indicated in https://root.cern/for_developers/doxygen/#how-to-generate-the-doxygen-documentation. Some flags like:. ```. BUILD_DOCS [OFF]. BUILD_DOCS_CORE [ON]. BUILD_DOCS_GRAF2D [OFF]. BUILD_DOCS_QHP [OFF]. ... ```. with the configurable QHP generation, see, https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8781. and then calling:. `doxygen_add_docs(...)` with all the variables correctly set to generate the proper Doxyfile. This requires some (one-time) manual copy work from the actual Doxyfile to the CMakeLists.txt, but it will look clean in the end.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** interoperability

**2. Attribute Description:** Interoperability is the degree to which two or more systems can usefully exchange and correctly interpret meaningful information via their interfaces within a particular context.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on data formats and protocols for exchanging information between *separate systems*. Strong examples will mention a standardized data format (like JSON, XML, TSV) or a network protocol for communication with an external system.

**4. Content to Analyze:** The value returned by this function can be returned from convertToErrorCode for Error values where no sensible translation to std::error_code exists. It should only be used in this situation, and should never be used where a sensible conversion to std::error_code is available, as attempts to convert to/from this error will result in a fatal error. (i.e. it is a programmatic error to try to convert such a value).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content describes a design choice regarding error handling. It explains why this function should not be used for certain Error values that cannot be translated to std::error_code, thereby relating to the non-functional goal of interoperability by ensuring compatibility with external systems using standard data formats."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on the end-user experience. Strong examples will describe something that makes the software easier for a human to use, such as a clearer user interface, a more helpful error message, or a more intuitive workflow.

**4. Content to Analyze:** The version of the SDK which was used during the compilation. The option is used for two different purposes: on darwin the version is propagated to LLVM where it's used to support SDK Version metadata (See D55673). CUDA compilation uses it to control parts of CUDA compilation in clang that depend on specific version of the CUDA SDK.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

In addition to all features provided by Qt the ROOT version supports connecting slots to a class (as opposed to connecting to a specific object). These slots will be called whenever the specified signal is emitted by any object of the class. Also a slot can have default arguments and be either a class method or a stand-alone function (compiled or interpreted). Basic Concepts. Signals and slots are used for communication between objects. Signals are emitted by objects when they change their state in a way that may be interesting to the outside world. This is all the object does to communicate. It does not know if anything is receiving the signal at the other end. Slots can be used for receiving signals. A slot does not know if it has any signal(s) connected to it. This is true information encapsulation, and ensures that the object can be used as a true software component. Signals and slots can take any number of arguments of any type. It is possible to connect as many signals as you want to a single slot, and a signal can be connected to as many slots as you desire. It is possible to make a single connection from all objects of the same class. A Small Example. A minimal C++ class declaration might read:. ``` {.cpp}. class A {. private:. Int_t fValue;. public:.

5006,energy efficiency,"> tangentially, what's the fundamental reason we need a special interpretation of the same `offset` array instead of just having a new column for tracking the counter? can we really not spare one more `Uint16` or even `UInt8` per event to track it? The reason is indeed space savings.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

1519,testability,"Hi,. I think global trimming is just removing a fixed number of bases from either end of the reads. And for trimming by quality, both Naive and Phred algorithms use quality scores (http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=144154&postcount=17), but naive takes the quality score as an integer without taking into account the error probability it represents unlike the Phred algorithm.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Hi,. I think global trimming is just removing a fixed number of bases from either end of the reads. And for trimming by quality, both Naive and Phred algorithms use quality scores (http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=144154&postcount=17), but naive takes the quality score as an integer without taking into account the error probability it represents unlike the Phred algorithm.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

TODO: Using a spin lock on every allocation can be quite expensive when contention is high. Since this is mainly used for BumpPtrAllocator and SpecificBumpPtrAllocator, it'd be better to have a specific thread-safe BumpPtrAllocator implementation that only use a fair lock when allocating a new slab but otherwise using atomic and be lock-free.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

**2. Attribute Description:** Safety refers to the software's ability to avoid entering hazardous states that could cause damage, injury, or loss of life, and to recover or limit harm if such states are entered.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on preventing physical harm or catastrophic failure. Strong examples will relate to systems where a failure could cause real-world harm (e.g., medical, automotive) and describe a mechanism to prevent that specific harm.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Hi Danilo, does the last commit mean that the standard `std::not_fn` fails to pass the test? I saw that the backport headers has guards against C++17 and Windows. How about adding an else clause and still running the test by including the standard `std::not_fn`?

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content describes specific steps for adding an instruction to LLVM, including modifying tablegen files, test cases, and other components. It explicitly mentions design choices related to code generation and testing, such as using the DAGToDAG method and ensuring compatibility with bitcode format.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** testability

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** [temp.deduct]p9 A lambda-expression appearing in a function type or a template parameter is not considered part of the immediate context for the purposes of template argument deduction. CWG2672: A lambda-expression body is never in the immediate context.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** usability

**2. Attribute Description:** Usability is concerned with how easily users can accomplish desired tasks and the kind of user support the system provides to facilitate their effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on the end-user experience. Strong examples will describe something that makes the software easier for a human to use, such as a clearer user interface, a more helpful error message, or a more intuitive workflow.

**4. Content to Analyze:** This might be worth an error message

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content to analyze is: This might be worth an error message. First, I need to check if this reads like software codebase or technical documentation. It seems to refer to a comment about an error message in the context of software development. Now, analyzing the primary intent: Is it describing functionality? Functionality would explain what the system does, but here it's not detailing any specific function; rather, it's suggesting consideration for an error message feature. So this is more about quality attributes than just stating what code does. The scope and distinctions focus on end-user experience, specifically usability aspects like ease of task accomplishment or helpful user support. This content directly addresses the design choice related to error messages which can impact user satisfaction and effectiveness during their interaction with the software. Therefore, it meets the criteria for being a direct example of usability."

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** integrability

**2. Attribute Description:** Integrability refers to the ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined and made to work together effectively as a coherent whole, often supported by mechanisms that reduce coupling and manage dependencies.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on APIs, component design, and dependency management that allow different parts of a system to be combined. Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

It explicitly mentions performance issues: 'it is at least 10x slower than PCA' and the need for dense data matrices which can be limiting, indicating a design choice made to address computational efficiency or scalability concerns (a non-functional goal). This meets the criteria of describing why the code was designed this way in relation to security? Wait no, let's recheck. The attribute is Security but the text talks about performance and limitations regarding big data implementation. However, note that the description says 'we assume you can load the data matrix in dense form' which implies a limitation (security risk?) due to memory constraints if not done properly. But this connection requires significant assumptions: loading large matrices as dense could lead to security vulnerabilities by exposing sensitive data or increasing attack surface? The text doesn't explicitly state that, it just states a technical constraint. Also, the deviance-based filtering is mentioned but without explicit threat context. Therefore, I must reclassify."

**4. Content to Analyze:** We use the multiplicative formula: n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-(k-1)) / k(k-1)(k-2)...1 . At each iteration, we take the n-th term of the numeral and divide by the (k-n)th term of the denominator. This division will always produce an integral result, and helps reduce the chance of overflow in the intermediate computations. However, we can still overflow even when the final result would fit.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**4. Content to Analyze:** I always run with the gnuinstall option, and I see no failures. But I don't have as many tests in total as you. For my 6.08.04 build I have (see: https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/root/6.08.04/1.fc25/data/logs/x86_64/build.log):. 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 602. This is with a few tests requiring network access disabled. make test ARGS=-j16 --output-on-failure -E test-stressIOPlugins-.*|tutorial-tree-run_h1analysis|tutorial-multicore-imt001_parBranchProcessing|tutorial-multicore-mp103_processSelector|tutorial-multicore-imt101_parTreeProcessing . But those few disabled tests do not account for the difference between 602 and 1395. I disable all the builtin options (except for llvm), and build using the versions of external dependencies that are available in the distribution. Can you elaborate on what you mean by because the ROOT libraries are expected in different place""? When running the test suite in the build tree, the libraries are expected to be in the same place independently of the gnuinstall option (i.e. in ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib). The location of the built targets in the build tree are supposed to not depend on whether the gnuinstall option is on or off.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Impose a total order (by name) on the replacement of functions. This is important when operating on more than one module independently to prevent cycles of thunks calling each other when the modules are linked together.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**2. Attribute Description:** Integrability refers to the ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined and made to work together effectively as a coherent whole, often supported by mechanisms that reduce coupling and manage dependencies.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on APIs, component design, and dependency management that allow different parts of a system to be combined. Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component. Distinguish from 'Interoperability', which is about exchanging data with external systems.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Samples k elements with uniform probability from an iterable. Selects a subset of k elements from n input elements with uniform probability without needing to hold all n elements in memory at the same time. This implementation has max space complexity O(min(k, n)), i.e., we allocate up to min(k, n) elements to store the samples. This means that we only use ~n elements when n is smaller than k, which can be important when k is large. If n elements are added to this sampler, and n <= k, all n elements will be retained. If n > k, each added element will be retained with a uniform probability of k / n. The order of the k retained samples from our n elements is undefined. In particular that means that the elements in the returned list can occur in a different order than they appeared in the iterable. More details about reservoir sampling (and the specific algorithm used here called Algorithm R) can be found on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling#Algorithm_R Args: iterable: Python iterable. The iterable to sample from. k: int. The number of elements to sample. random: A random number generator or None. Returns: A list containing the k sampled elements. Raises: ValueError: If k is negative.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content describes functionality by explaining what reservoir sampling does. It also mentions performance benefits but without explicitly stating a non-functional goal. However, upon closer inspection, it fails to describe the 'why' behind design choices for integrability."
