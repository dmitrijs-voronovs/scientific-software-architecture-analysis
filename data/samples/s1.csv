You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

Note that this does *not* preserve the uniqueness of node IDs! The selection DAG must no longer depend on their uniqueness when this function is used.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

1385,deployability,"Hi @mdriller . My answer to your question will depend on what exactly you will need from Plink and what sort of cohort approach you have. . If you just want to be able to run Plink on the joint genotype results, I wonder if you can try following the process which was performed for UKBiobank to convert their DeepVariant exome joint calls into PLINK format. That is the section **Conversion of pVCF to PLINK and BGEN files** [from the UKBiobank WES Protocol](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/ukb/docs/UKB_WES_Protocol.pdf). I hope this will work, as it is not generally our preference to replicate the functionality of -ERC BP_RESOLUTION, and this is likely to make writing output much slower. If, instead, you want calls at specific sites (similar to a genotyping chip approach but with NGS data), I would say that is is possible to force genotyping at a given set of alleles with one of the modules of DeepVariant (VCF candidate importer). I suspect this isn't what you want though. Thank you,. Andrew.","

Assuming that `fChain` is the pointer to the **`TChain`**. being processed, use. ``` {.cpp}. fChain->GetTree()->GetEntry(entry);. ```. To create a selector call:. ``` {.cpp}. root[] T->MakeSelector(""MySelector"");. ```.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**1. Quality Attribute:** integrability

**2. Attribute Description:** Integrability refers to the ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined and made to work together effectively as a coherent whole, often supported by mechanisms that reduce coupling and manage dependencies.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on APIs, component design, and dependency management that allow different parts of a system to be combined. Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component. Distinguish from 'Interoperability', which is about exchanging data with external systems.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

**4. Content to Analyze:** The item is marked public in the format string.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

6293,availability," supporting arbitrary output rescaling might wish for more than one row group of context when shrinking the image; tough, we don't handle that. (This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at the upsample step needn't be much less than one.) To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row. (The last row group can't be processed until we have another row group for its below-context, and so we have to save the next-to-last group too for its above-context.) We could do this most simply by copying data around in our buffer, but that'd be very slow. We can avoid copying any data by creating a rather strange pointer structure. Here's how it works. We allocate a workspace consisting of M+2 row groups (where M = min_DCT_scaled_size is the number of row groups per iMCU row). We create two sets of redundant pointers to the workspace. Labeling the physical row groups 0 to M+1, the synthesized pointer lists look like this: M+1 M-1 master pointer --> 0 master pointer --> 0 1 1 ... ... M-3 M-3 M-2 M M-1 M+1 M M-2 M+1 M-1 0 0 We read alternate iMCU rows using each master pointer; thus the last two row groups of the previous iMCU row remain un-overwritten in the workspace. The pointer lists are set up so that the required context rows appear to be adjacent to the proper places when we pass the pointer lists to the upsampler.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

**4. Content to Analyze:**  supporting arbitrary output rescaling might wish for more than one row group of context when shrinking the image; tough, we don't handle that. (This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at the upsample step needn't be much less than one.) To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row. (The last row group can't be processed until we have another row group for its below-context, and so we have to save the next-to-last group too for its above-context.) We could do this most simply by copying data around in our buffer, but that'd be very slow. We can avoid copying any data by creating a rather strange pointer structure. Here's how it works. We allocate a workspace consisting of M+2 row groups (where M = min_DCT_scaled_size is the number of row groups per iMCU row). We create two sets of redundant pointers to the workspace. Labeling the physical row groups 0 to M+1, the synthesized pointer lists look like this: M+1 M-1 master pointer --> 0 master pointer --> 0 1 1 ... ... M-3 M-3 M-2 M M-1 M+1 M M-2 M+1 M-1 0 0 We read alternate iMCU rows using each master pointer; thus the last two row groups of the previous iMCU row remain un-overwritten in the workspace. The pointer lists are set up so that the required context rows appear to be adjacent to the proper places when we pass the pointer lists to the upsampler. The above pictures describe the normal state of the pointer lists. At top and bottom of the image, we diddle the pointer lists to duplicate the first or last sample row as necessary (this is cheaper than copying sample rows around). This scheme breaks down if M < 2, ie, min_DCT_scaled_size is 1. In that situation each iMCU row provides only one row group so the buffering logic must be different (eg, we must read two iMCU rows before we can e

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**2. Attribute Description:** Security is the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorised access or manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability for legitimate users.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on protection against malicious actors. Strong examples will explicitly mention a security threat (e.g., injection attack, unauthorized access) or a security mechanism (e.g., encryption, input sanitization, authentication).

**4. Content to Analyze:** I made a hack solution for this to have something that would work for me. I put it here: https://gist.github.com/Xparx/33026da63dabb1c200b2602bbae0b95c. It's not defensively coded so it might bug out without proper input.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

**4. Content to Analyze:** mismatches allowed in adapter trimming; Dear all. Thanks for making this great tool available. Maybe, I missed it in the documentation but I can't seem to find a description of how many mismatches you allow when trimming adapters. So my question is: If I explicitely specify a set of adapter sequences, what is the similarity criterion that must be fulfilled in order to trim the adapters? Best regards. Hubert

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

The signature of the public function `isIdenticalNoCov` is extended by a. tolerance parameter for the error comparison. This is expected to not. break user code, because the function was only introduced in 6.26 and is. so far only used in a single unit test (`testSumW2Error`). The `testRooAbsPdf` unit test didn't reset the initial parameter errors. correctly, which is now fixed.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** usability

**2. Attribute Description:** Usability is concerned with how easily users can accomplish desired tasks and the kind of user support the system provides to facilitate their effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on the end-user experience. Strong examples will describe something that makes the software easier for a human to use, such as a clearer user interface, a more helpful error message, or a more intuitive workflow.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Slot called whenever the date text size mode is modified by the user.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,The content describes functionality by stating what action occurs ('Slot called whenever...') but does not explicitly explain why this design choice relates to usability. It lacks direct evidence of a non-functional goal such as user support or ease of task accomplishment.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.

",True,"**Step 1: Context Check.** The content appears to be from a software codebase context as it discusses Python compatibility issues, test failures related to numerical instability in multi-threaded processing, and references specific developers or team members (e.g., @hageboeck). This is technical discussion relevant to software development.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.** The primary intent of the content seems to be describing a quality attribute ('Deployability') because it addresses issues that affect system stability and reliability during deployment or operation, which are non-functional goals related to how easily updates can be delivered without causing problems. However, upon closer inspection, the text is primarily discussing technical bugs and limitations (multi-threaded numerical instability) rather than explicitly describing why certain design choices were made for deployability.

**Step 3: Apply Scope & Distinctions.** The scope requires direct evidence of deployment-related processes or infrastructure. This content does not mention build scripts, package managers, Dockerfiles, or CI/CD pipelines. Instead, it focuses on a technical issue (numerical instability) and the inability to fix it from the Python side.

**Step 4: Final Decision.** The connection is weak because the text describes a problem that affects reliability but does not explicitly discuss deployment processes or infrastructure. Therefore, I classify this as a false positive."

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Consume a sequence of spelled tokens that didn't expand to anything. In the simplest case, skips spelled tokens until finding one that produced the NextExpanded token, and creates an empty mapping for them. If Drain is provided, skips remaining tokens from that file instead.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** [ROOT-9617] Add TTree::SetBranchAddress pythonization; Modify the behaviour of SetBranchAddress so that proxy references can be passed as arguments from the Python side, more precisely in cases where the C++ implementation of the method expects the address of a pointer. For example:. ```python. v = ROOT.std.vector('int')(). t.SetBranchAddress(""my_vector_branch"", v). ```. Pending items:. - Check failure in Python 3. - Test other overloads. - Any other case to support? E.g. SetBranchAddress of individual elements in a struct? - Use helper method `GetClass` that was factored out

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** modifiability

**2. Attribute Description:** Modifiability refers to the ease with which changes, such as adding, deleting, or modifying functionality, quality attributes, capacity, or technology, can be made to a system, ideally involving the fewest distinct elements.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code structure that makes future changes easier. Strong examples will mention refactoring, decoupling, modularity, or using a design pattern for the explicit purpose of simplifying future development.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Create a function pointer with the given type, name, and initializer in the given Module.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,The content describes a design pattern for creating function pointers to achieve modifiability. It explicitly states that this approach allows for easy addition of new functionality by simply adding a new function and modifying the initializer list without changing existing code structure.

Would you accept a PR that simply moves the test utils into private submodules of `scanpy.testing` and switches the import mode to (future default, drawback-less) `importlib`? Any change to the test layout can come later or never. I’d like to follow pytest’s recommendation (`/src/scanpy/` and `/tests/`) but this issue is orthogonal to that.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

This is a. simple way to test for proper debug info handling. The ``debugify`` utility pass. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``debugify`` testing utility is just a pair of passes: ``debugify`` and. ``check-debugify``. The first appl

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content describes how to update debug info in IR-level transformations by using specific utility passes. This explains a mechanism that ensures proper handling of debug information even when other parts of the code change, which is directly related to safety because it prevents potential hazards from incorrect or lost debug information during transformations."
1722,security," The tutorial sparsehist.C shows the turning point. On a AMD64 with 8GB memory, THnSparse wins starting with a TH3 with 30 bins per dimension. Using a THnSparse for a one-dimensional histogram is only reasonable if it has a huge number of bins. Projections The dimensionality of a THnSparse can be reduced by projecting it to 1, 2, 3, or n dimensions, which can be represented by a TH1, TH2, TH3, or a THnSparse. See the Projection() members. To only project parts of the histogram, call THnSparse::GetAxis(12)->SetRange(from_bin, to_bin); Internal Representation An entry for a filled bin consists of its n-dimensional coordinates and its bin content. The coordinates are compacted to use as few bits as possible; e.g. a histogram with 10 bins in x and 20 bins in y will only use 4 bits for the x representation and 5 bits for the y representation. This is handled by the internal class THnSparseCompactBinCoord. Bin data (content and coordinates) are allocated in chunks of size fChunkSize; this parameter can be set when constructing a THnSparse. Each chunk is represented by an object of class THnSparseArrayChunk. Translation from an n-dimensional bin coordinate to the linear index within the chunks is done by GetBin(). It creates a hash from the compacted bin coordinates (the hash of a bin coordinate is the compacted coordinate itself if it takes less than 8 bytes, the size of a Long64_t. This hash is used to lookup the linear index in the TExMap member fBins; the coordinates of the entry fBins points to is compared to the coordinates passed to GetBin(). If they do not match, these two coordinates have the same hash - which is extremely unlikely but (for the case where the compact bin coordinates are larger than 4 bytes) possible. In this case, fBinsContinued contains a chain of linear indexes with the same hash. Iterating through this chain and comparing each bin coordinates with the one passed to GetBin() will retrieve the matching bin.","

I think maybe we should postpone discussing `ingest` until later (as well as recipes based on our Nat Comms paper, and other topics raised above) and focus on switching to openTSNE first. Scanpy's architecture is to compute kNN graph by calling `sc.pp.neighbors` and then run dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and clustering (Leiden) on this graph. I think this is very neat and makes everything consistent and other functions should follow this approach as much as possible. So IMHO if it's possible to run t-SNE on the kNN graph with k=15, then that's what we should do. And luckily it is possible! I can even see two approaches. (1) Either use k=15 kNN graph with the uniform similarity kernel. As I said, and as Pavlin knows, this yields result that is *very* similar to using perplexity=30. (2) Or use k=15 kNN graph with UMAP weights, normalize it as t-SNE expects it to be normalized and use that. My expectation is that it would yield very similar results, but I haven't actually tried it. Admittedly, this is not the vanilla t-SNE. But it's very close. And I think advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Actually this is quite a bit faster than the standard t-SNE, because it only uses k=15 instead of k=90 (3 times perplexity=30).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** modifiability

**2. Attribute Description:** Modifiability refers to the ease with which changes, such as adding, deleting, or modifying functionality, quality attributes, capacity, or technology, can be made to a system, ideally involving the fewest distinct elements.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code structure that makes future changes easier. Strong examples will mention refactoring, decoupling, modularity, or using a design pattern for the explicit purpose of simplifying future development.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

The effects. of non-linearity and numerical roundoff both become more important as. the external value gets closer to one of the limits (expressed as the. distance to nearest limit divided by distance between limits). The user. must therefore be aware of the fact that, for example, if they put limits. of $(0,10^{10})$ on a parameter, then the values $0.0$ and $1.0$ will be. indistinguishable to the accuracy of most machines. For this purpose single sided limits on parameters are provided by M ,. with their transformation being:. Lower bound $a$:. $$\begin{aligned}. P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \pm\sqrt{(P_{\mathrm{ext}} - a + 1)^2 - 1} \\. P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a - 1 + \sqrt{P_{\mathrm{int}}^2 + 1} \end{aligned}$$. Upper bound $b$:. $$\begin{aligned}.

The transformation of course also affects the parameter error matrix, so. M does a transformation of the error matrix (and the parabolic"". parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users should however. realize that the transformation is only a linear approximation, and that. it cannot give a meaningful result if one or more parameters is very. close to a limit, where. $\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}} / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 0$. Therefore, it is recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in. order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the limits. should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or. re-perform the error analysis without limits.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on preventing physical harm or catastrophic failure. Strong examples will relate to systems where a failure could cause real-world harm (e.g., medical, automotive) and describe a mechanism to prevent that specific harm.

**4. Content to Analyze:** ical calculation of the $\mbox{FCN}$ value. The effects. of non-linearity and numerical roundoff both become more important as. the external value gets closer to one of the limits (expressed as the. distance to nearest limit divided by distance between limits). The user. must therefore be aware of the fact that, for example, if they put limits. of $(0,10^{10})$ on a parameter, then the values $0.0$ and $1.0$ will be. indistinguishable to the accuracy of most machines. For this purpose single sided limits on parameters are provided by M ,. with their transformation being:. Lower bound $a$:. $$\begin{aligned}. P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \pm\sqrt{(P_{\mathrm{ext}} - a + 1)^2 - 1} \\. P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a - 1 + \sqrt{P_{\mathrm{int}}^2 + 1} \end{aligned}$$. Upper bound $b$:. $$\begin{aligned}. P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \pm\sqrt{(b - P_{\mathrm{ext}} + 1)^2 - 1} \\. P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& b + 1 - \sqrt{P_{\mathrm{int}}^2 + 1} \end{aligned}$$. The transformation of course also affects the parameter error matrix, so. M does a transformation of the error matrix (and the parabolic"". parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users should however. realize that the transformation is only a linear approximation, and that. it cannot give a meaningful result if one or more parameters is very. close to a limit, where. $\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}} / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 0$. Therefore, it is recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in. order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the limits. should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or. re-perform the error analysis without limits. Further discussion of the effects of parameter limits may be found in. the last chapter. M strategy . At many places in the analysis of the $\mbox{FCN}$ (the user. provided function), M must decide whether to be safe and waste a few. function calls in order

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** availability

**2. Attribute Description:** Availability refers to a system's ability to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval, ensuring it is ready to carry out its task when needed.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on system-level uptime and recovery from major failures. Strong examples will describe mechanisms for handling crashes, network outages, or service failover. Distinguish this from component-level 'Reliability', which involves a single function handling bad data or preventing a null pointer error.

**4. Content to Analyze:** [RF] Make RooAbsTestStatistic error out if multiple ranges are passed; The RooFit test statistic classes give wrong results if they are. constructed from multiple comma-separated ranges. This can cause errors,. such as the one reported in Jira issue [ROOT-10038](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-10038). This commit suggests to throw an exception if multiple comma-separated. ranges are detected.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,The content describes functionality by explaining what happens when multiple ranges are passed. It does not explicitly explain why this design choice is made to achieve a non-functional goal like availability or fault tolerance.

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** testability

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Divide the string up into simple strings and measure each string.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content to analyze is: 'Divide the string up into simple strings and measure each string.' This statement describes a specific action taken in the code for testing purposes. It implies that breaking down the input data (like large text) into smaller parts allows for easier fault detection during execution-based testing, as it simplifies handling complex inputs or edge cases. The intent is clearly about making the system more testable by controlling how strings are processed and measured."

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** integrability

**2. Attribute Description:** Integrability refers to the ease with which software components or distinct systems can be combined and made to work together effectively as a coherent whole, often supported by mechanisms that reduce coupling and manage dependencies.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on APIs, component design, and dependency management that allow different parts of a system to be combined. Strong examples will describe how a component is designed to be pluggable or how it uses a well-defined API to connect with another component. Distinguish from 'Interoperability', which is about exchanging data with external systems.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Note that FromType has not necessarily been transformed by the array-to-pointer or function-to-pointer implicit conversions, so check for their presence as well as checking whether FromType is a pointer.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

1185,security,"Hi @SHuang-Broad,. Thank you both for the detailed statistics background information. For PEPPER - we're now not using the code from that approach and instead are using the make_examples logic in DeepVariant. However, you conclusion will still be correct. Within make_examples and even call_variants we're still not using the GPU to its fullest capability. Improving GPU utilization is an area we could make progress on. However, the skill profile of the team will allow us to do the work, but not as quickly as for groups that have more experience optimizing GPU performance. As a result, we don't feel that our team's leverage is as high for that work as opposed to other projects. We may get to it eventually, but it will probably remain lower priority. @pgrosu Thank you for the I/O profile. We have also flagged I/O as a bottleneck and area for improvement in DeepVariant in general. At this time, for speed improvements, we are looking into optimizations which reduce the amount of data being passed back and forth for various function calls. This seems to us to be the most engineer-time efficient way to speed up DeepVariant currently. I am hopeful that this will result in runtime improvements in the next 1 or 2 releases.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",False,The content to analyze appears to be about resolving an issue with software installation dependencies rather than describing a specific quality attribute. It does not explicitly state why the design choice was made in terms of energy efficiency.

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

You are a meticulous software engineering expert acting as a strict quality gatekeeper. Your task is to determine if a sentence from a software codebase or its technical documentation is a **direct and unambiguous** example of a specific quality attribute.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Avoid False Positives at All Costs:** If a connection is weak, indirect, or requires significant assumptions, you must classify it as a false positive.
2.  **Principle of Direct Evidence:** The content must explicitly describe the *'why'* behind a design choice as it relates to a non-functional goal. Do not infer a quality attribute from a simple description of what the code *does*.

### Data for Evaluation

**1. Quality Attribute:** testability

**2. Attribute Description:** Testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to quickly reveal its faults through execution-based testing, by providing controllability and observability of its state and limiting complexity.

**3. Scope & Distinctions (Crucial Guardrails):** Focus on code or design that simplifies testing. Strong examples will mention a specific testing practice (like dependency injection, mocking) or adding a feature (like logging) for the explicit purpose of making testing easier.

**4. Content to Analyze:** Try to reduce the pass list again. This covers additional cases we failed to reduce earlier, because of more complex pass dependencies triggering the crash.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).
",True,"The content to analyze is: ""Try to reduce the pass list again. This covers additional cases we failed to reduce earlier, because of more complex pass dependencies triggering the crash."" I first check if this is from a software context. It appears to be a comment about code behavior and testing issues, so it's plausible for a codebase or documentation. The primary intent seems to be describing functionality (what the code does) rather than explicitly stating why it was designed that way for a non-functional goal. However, upon closer inspection, I notice terms like ""pass list"" which might refer to test passes and mentions of crashes during testing, suggesting an implicit concern with testability by addressing issues in the test suite itself. But without explicit language about design choices or features added specifically for testability (like dependency injection), it doesn't directly describe a quality attribute. The text focuses on fixing problems in tests rather than explaining why certain aspects are made testable. Therefore, I must classify this as a false positive because there's no direct and unambiguous example of the quality attribute description provided."

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

These variables are used for both exceptions and setjmp/longjmps. THREW__ indicates whether an exception or a longjmp occurred or not. 0 means nothing occurred, 1 means an exception occurred, and other numbers mean a longjmp occurred. In the case of longjmp, __THREW__ variable indicates the corresponding setjmp buffer the longjmp corresponds to. threwValue is 0 for exceptions, and the argument to longjmp in case of longjmp.

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response

Provide your response with only the following two fields:
- `true_positive`: `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: A concise explanation for your decision based on the step-by-step analysis. Your explanation must begin by explicitly stating if the primary intent is 'Describing Functionality' or 'Describing a Quality Attribute'. If false, you must state which rule or distinction it failed and suggest the more appropriate quality attribute (e.g., Reliability, Performance, Maintainability).

### Instructions for Analysis

Follow this **mandatory** reasoning process step-by-step:

**Step 1: Context Check.**
First, determine if the 'Content to Analyze' is plausibly a comment from a software codebase or technical documentation.
- If it reads like a scientific abstract, a news article, or any other non-software text, it is **out of scope**. Respond immediately with `true_positive: false` and reasoning that the content is not from a software context.

**Step 2: Intent vs. Quality.**
Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

Analyze the content's primary intent. This is the most important step. You must rigorously differentiate between:
- **Describing Functionality:** Text that only explains what the code *does*. (e.g., ""This function parses a file."") This is **not** a true positive.
- **Describing a Quality Attribute:** Text that explains *why* the code is designed in a certain way to achieve a non-functional goal. (e.g., ""The parser uses a streaming API to handle large files without running out of memory."") This **is** a potential true positive.

**Step 3: Apply the Scope & Distinctions.**
Reread the 'Scope & Distinctions' section carefully. Does the intent you identified in Step 2 fall squarely within this scope?
- A strong example must match the positive descriptions provided in the scope hint, not the concepts it should be distinguished from.

**Step 4: Final Decision.**
Based on the strict application of the steps above, make your final decision.

### Your Response
