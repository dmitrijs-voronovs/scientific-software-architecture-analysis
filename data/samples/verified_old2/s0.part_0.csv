You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The source text contains a mix of code and comments, including some human-written analysis like 'I see.' and error messages from './pad5.exe'. However, the primary substance is technical artifacts (code) with embedded elements.

In this case, there are some prose elements ('I see.', '*** Break *** floating point e') that should be considered. The AI's reasoning is flawed because it doesn't properly weigh the substantial code portions against these minimal human elements.

",incorrect,"The AI's decision to eliminate the source text is incorrect because it fundamentally misrepresents its primary nature. The source text describes a filtering operation in a file (arm_acle.h) and includes specific terms (__arm_cdp, __arm_ldcl, __arm_stcl). According to the original prompt, content should be kept if it consists of meaningful human-written prose or explanation intended for developers. This line appears to be an instruction or comment within code documentation, explaining what is being filtered out from a source file. It contains technical discussion about filtering specific elements in arm_acle.h and could be part of a larger context where such information is communicated to humans (e.g., in comments or configuration files). The AI's reasoning incorrectly labels it as lacking natural language narrative when the substance describes an action relevant to human readers, specifically developers working on ARM assembly-related code. It should not be eliminated because it reflects communication intended for developers about technical artifacts."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

public:. MyClass(int i) : fInt(i) {}. int get_int() { return fInt; }. private:. int fInt;. };. and a corresponding Linkdef.h file, selecting only ``MyClass``::. ifdef __ROOTCLING__. pragma link off all classes;. pragma link off all functions;. pragma link off all globals;. pragma link off all typedef;. pragma link C++ class MyClass;. endif. For more pragmas, see the `rootcling manual`_. E.g., a commonly useful pragma is one that selects all C++ entities that are. declared in a specific header file::. pragma link C++ defined_in MyClass.h"";. Next, use ``rootcling`` to generate the dictionary (here:. ``MyClass_rflx.cxx``) and module files::. $ rootcling -f MyClass_rflx.cxx MyClass.h Linkdef.h. Alternatively, define a myclass_selection.xml file::. &lt;lcgdict&gt;. &lt;class name=""MyClass /&gt;. &lt;/lcgdict&gt;. serving the same purpose as the Linkdef.h file above (in fact, ``rootcling``. accepts a selection.xml file in lieu of a Linkdef.h""). For more tags, see the `selection file`_ documentation. Commonly used are ``namespace``, ``function``, ``enum``, or ``variable``. instead of the ``class`` tag, and ``pattern`` instead of ``name`` with. wildcarding in the value string. Next, use ``genreflex`` to generate the dictionary (here:. ``MyClass_rflx.cxx``) and module files::. $ genreflex MyClass.h --selection=myclass_selection.xml -o MyClass_rflx.cxx. From here, compile and link the generated dictionary file with the project. and/or system specific options and libraries into a shared library, using. ``cling-config`` for the relevant cppyy compiler/linker flags. (For work on MS Windows, this `helper script`_ may be useful.). To continue the example, assuming Linux::. $ g++ `cling-config --cppflags` -fPIC -O2 -shared MyClass_rflx.cxx -o MyClassDict.so. Instead of loading the header text into ``cling``, you can now load the. dictionary:. .. code-block:: python. &gt;&gt;&gt; import cppyy. &gt;&gt;&gt; cppyy.load_reflection_info('MyClassDict'). &gt;&gt;&gt; cppyy.gbl.MyClass(42). &lt;cppyy.gbl.MyClass object

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

",incorrect,"The AI's output classifies the content as 'to_eliminate': true, meaning it should be filtered out. However, according to the prompt, we must keep content that includes scientific or detailed technical discussions even if embedded in code-like artifacts. The source text is a technical explanation about ROOT functionalities (minimization algorithms and vectors), which falls under the category of detailed technical discussion as per the examples provided. For instance, Example 5 kept similar tagged documentation because it explained design strategies with commentary. Here, despite being formatted like technical descriptions, the content discusses minimization methods and vector packages in a way that reflects human-to-human communication about complex topics. The AI's reasoning incorrectly states there is no substantial narrative or analysis, but the text does provide explanations of algorithms, their usage, and related libraries (like GenVector).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)

- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's decision was incorrect because the source text contains a detailed log of function calls and their locations (e.g., memory addresses, library paths) which is characteristic of technical artifacts. However, according to the prompt rules, content should be kept if it includes significant natural language explanation or discussion even when embedded in technical artifacts. The AI's reasoning correctly identified that there was no human analysis present, but incorrectly concluded that this entire block should be eliminated based on its primary nature being purely a log without any accompanying narrative. In fact, the source text does contain prose elements (the function names and their descriptions) which could potentially serve as documentation if properly contextualized, though they are currently presented in a highly technical format lacking explanatory commentary."

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**

reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

PyROOT incorrect/unstable overload resolution with enum class.; With master (commit 7f3f3428e4d20) (but has been present for a long time), PyROOT overload resolution of function that takes an enum class is unstable (it appears to depend on the value rather than the type). With the test file below compiled by ACLiC (for example) running the script:. ```python. import ROOT. ROOT.gSystem.Load(""enums_cxx""). h = ROOT.Holder(). for i in range(10, 0, -1):. h.SetTwo(i). ROOT.to_string(h.two). ```. gives. ```txt. Calling to_string for enum EOne with 0. Calling to_string for enum EOne with 1. ... ```. I.e. even-though the argument is an enum ETwo', the overload take an `enum EOne` actually called. In the original example (requires the code for Celeritas and VecGeom to build). For a similar script:. ```python. for i in range(0, 14, 1):. p.process_class = i. ROOT.celeritas.to_cstring(p.process_class). ```. I get:. ```txt. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 0 unknown. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 1 linear. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 2 log. to_cstring ImportPhysicsVectorType called with 3 free. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 4 ionisation_subsec. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 5 csda_range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 6 range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 7 secondary_range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 8 inverse_range. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 9 lambda. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 10 sublambda. to_cstring ImportTableType called with 11 lambda_prim. to_cstring ImportProcessType called with 12 ucn. to_cstring ImportProcessClass called with 13 annihilation. ```. i.e. the *same* code line given the *same* data members (and thus always the *same* type), call 3 different overloads over the loop iterations.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

This document contains information necessary to successfully implement this. interface, use it, and to test both sides. It also explains some of the finer. points about what exactly results mean. ``AliasAnalysis`` Class Overview. ================================. The `AliasAnalysis <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__. class defines the interface that the various alias analysis implementations. should support. This class exports two important enums: ``AliasResult`` and. ``ModRefResult`` which represent the result of an alias query or a mod/ref. query, respectively. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes information about memory, represented in. several different ways. In particular, memory objects are represented as a. starting address and size, and function calls are represented as the actual. ``call`` or ``invoke`` instructions that performs the call. The. ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to. get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions. All ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces require that in queries involving multiple. values, values which are not :ref:`constants <constants>` are all. defined within the same function. Representation of Pointers. --------------------------. Most importantly, the ``AliasAnalysis`` class provides several methods which are. used to query whether or not two memory objects alias, whether function calls. can modify or read a memory object, etc. For all of these queries, memory. objects are represented as a pair of their starting address (a symbolic LLVM. ``Value*``) and a static size. Representing memory objects as a starting address and a size is critically. important for correct Alias Analyses. For example, consider this (silly, but. possible) C code:. .. code-block:: c++. int i;. char C[2];. char A[10];. /* ... */. for (i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {. C","

The. ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to. get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**
groups() on my gene expression data, I do get separate matrices for names, scores, pvals, and pvals_adj. However, the scores don't match the pvals. In other words, with decreasing pvals, we don't always have increasing score. I did check out the description on the main documentations page, and they say they're calculating the zscores underlying the distribution, however if that's the case shouldn't it always be higher with decreasing pval? Also, I went through the code: it looks like they're calculating the scores on the absolute values instead of the real values--why is this? Are the scores basically U1 values corresponding to the pvalues, in whcih case once again lower pvalues should always have higher scores right? ares calculated from the p-values? What's the relation between the two. I have ran sc.rank_genes_groups() on my gene expression data, and I have generated the matrix for cluster-1 versus the rest, for reference. You can see that one, the pavlues don't increase as we go down the rows; and two, the scores seem kinda arbitrary to the p-values. What am I missing here? Thanks a lot, and sorry for the wordy question. [NOTE: This doesn't just depend on a specific type of clustering technique. Irrespective of whether I try the in-built Leiden clustering technique, or the Schit library, or even cluster the cells randomly, this issue keeps occuring--which makes me think it's ether a bug, or I don't quite understand how the score generation works, maybe both. I've provided a little code snipper below.]. [ClusterOneVsRest.csv](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/files/12243486/ClusterOneVsRest.csv).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

Impact of llvm optimizations on coverage reports. ================================================. llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no. impact on coverage report quality. This is due to the fact that the mapping. from source regions to profile counters is immutable, and is generated before. the llvm optimizer kicks in. The optimizer can't prove that profile counter. instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the. program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade. during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables. Using the profiling runtime without static initializers. =======================================================. By default the compiler runtime uses a static initializer to determine the. profile output path and to register a writer function. To collect profiles. without using static initializers, do this manually:. * Export a ``int __llvm_profile_runtime`` symbol from each instrumented shared. library and executable. When the linker finds a definition of this symbol, it. knows to skip loading the object which contains the profiling runtime's. static initializer. * Forward-declare ``void __llvm_profile_initialize_file(void)`` and call it. once from each instrumented executable. This function parses. ``LLVM_PROFILE_FILE``, sets the output path, and truncates any existing files. at that path. To get the same behavior without truncating existing files,. pass a filename pattern string to ``void __llvm_profile_set_filename(char. *)``. These calls can be placed anywhere so long as they precede all calls. to ``__llvm_profile_write_file``. * Forward-declare ``int __llvm_profile_write_file(void)`` and call it to write. out a profile.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true

reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly labels the source text as to be eliminated, but according to the prompt, content should be kept if it contains meaningful human-written prose or technical discussion. The provided source text appears to be a series of error messages from an SSL/TLS context, listing failed certificate loads with specific file paths and parameters like CURLOPT_CAPATH. This is not purely code or logs without explanation; it includes detailed system errors that are meant for developers debugging issues. It describes the loading process and failures in a narrative form, discussing what went wrong and which files were attempted to be loaded. Therefore, despite being technical, it contains significant natural language and analysis of an error situation, so it should not be eliminated."

ClassImp(SClass);. void SClass::Print() const {. cout &lt;&lt; fX = &lt;&lt; fX &lt;&lt; , fY = &lt;&lt; fY &lt;&lt; endl;. }. ```. You can add a class without using the `ClassDef` and `ClassImp` macros;. however, you will be limited. Specifically the object I/O features of. ROOT will not be available to you for these classes. See Cling the C++. Interpreter"". The `ShowMembers` and `Streamer` method, as well as the. `&gt;&gt;` operator overloads, are implemented only if you use `ClassDef` and. `ClassImp`. See `$ROOTSYS/include/Rtypes.h` for the definition of. `ClassDef` and `ClassImp`. To exclude a data member from the `Streamer`,. add a `!` as the first character in the comments of the field:. ``` {.cpp}. Int_t fTempValue; //! temporary state value. ```. The LinkDef.h File. **Step 3:** The `LinkDef.h` file tells `rootcling` which classes should. be added to the dictionary. ``` {.cpp}. ifdef __CLING__. pragma link C++ class SClass;. endif. ```. Three options can trail the class name:. - `-` : tells `rootcling` **not** to generate the `Streamer` method for. this class. This is necessary for those classes that need a. customized `Streamer` method. ``` {.cpp}. pragma link C++ class SClass-; // no streamer. ```. - **`!`** : tells `rootcling` **not** to generate the. `operator&gt;&gt;(`

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The <source_text> is a single sentence describing the 'AddDelta' method. The primary purpose of this text appears to be an explanation of how the method works, which includes technical details and functionality description. According to the original prompt's rules, content that consists of meaningful human discussion or analysis should not be eliminated unless it fundamentally misrepresents the nature of the source text.

The <original_prompt> instructs to keep content that is 'meaningful human discussion' if present. The provided <source_text> contains a technical explanation with natural language and intent for communication, which aligns with being primarily prose (technical documentation). However, the AI's output incorrectly classifies this as eliminating it.

The rules in the prompt state to keep content that is 'meaningful human discussion' or technical analysis. The source text describes a method's functionality, but does not contain any discussion or narrative beyond its definition and purpose. It lacks elements like critique, explanation of trade-offs, or suggestions for improvement—these are required for elimination.

The AI's reasoning in the output is flawed because it states that the content 'lacks depth, context, or discussion intended for human readers'. However, the source text does not need to be a detailed discussion; even a concise technical explanation with clear intent can be kept if it meets the criteria. The primary nature of this text is technical documentation explaining a method's function and usage, which should be kept according to the prompt rules."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation

Move the call to free before a NULL test. Check if this free is accessed after its argument has been test against NULL (property 0). If yes, it is legal to move this call in its predecessor block. The move is performed only if the block containing the call to free will be removed, i.e.: 1. it has only one predecessor P, and P has two successors 2. it contains the call, noops, and an unconditional branch 3. its successor is the same as its predecessor's successor The profitability is out-of concern here and this function should be called only if the caller knows this transformation would be profitable (e.g., for code size).

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

If you can’t use one of those, use a concrete class like AnnData. If your parameter only accepts an enumeration of strings, specify them like so: Literal['elem-1', elem-2']. Returns section#. There are three types of return sections – prose, tuple, and a mix of both. Prose is for simple cases. Tuple return sections are formatted like parameters. Other than in numpydoc, each tuple is first characterized by the identifier and not by its type. Provide type annotation in the function header. Mix of prose and tuple is relevant in complicated cases, e.g. when you want to describe that you added something as annotation to an `AnnData` object. Examples#. For simple cases, use prose as in normalize_total():. Returns. -------. Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`. or updates `adata` with normalized versions of the original. `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`. For tuple return values, you can use the standard numpydoc way of populating it,. e.g. as in calculate_qc_metrics(). Do not add types in the docstring, but specify them in the function signature:. def myfunc(...) -> tuple[int, str]:. . ... Returns. -------. one_identifier. Description. second_identifier.

- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The original prompt requires filtering content based on primary nature: if it's code, logs, human discussion, etc., but this text is clearly discussing a configuration change (CMake) that involves technical reasoning and commentary. However, the AI output to verify classifies it as not being eliminated, which aligns with the rule to keep communication intended for developers or users. But note: The source text does not contain any natural language narrative; it's formatted in a way that resembles code comments or configuration settings but is actually prose discussing technical decisions. However, the primary intent of this sentence appears to be providing instructions or guidelines (like a comment) rather than pure human discussion.

- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

ue is. the result of the modifier. An expression can be empty, in which case it is always true. See the example. at the top. Otherwise, it is a series of one or more numeric conditions,. separated by ,"". If any condition matches, the expression matches. Each. numeric condition can take one of three forms. * number: A simple decimal number matches if the argument is the same as the. number. Example: ``""%plural{1:mouse|:mice}0""``. * range: A range in square brackets matches if the argument is within the. range. Then range is inclusive on both ends. Example:. ``""%plural{0:none|1:one|[2,5]:some|:many}0""``. * modulo: A modulo operator is followed by a number, and equals sign and. either a number or a range. The tests are the same as for plain numbers. and ranges, but the argument is taken modulo the number first. Example:. ``""%plural{%100=0:even hundred|%100=[1,50]:lower half|:everything else}1""``. The parser is very unforgiving. A syntax error, even whitespace, will abort,. as will a failure to match the argument against any expression. **""ordinal format**. Example:. ``""ambiguity in %ordinal0 argument""``. Class:. Integers. Description:. This is a formatter which represents the argument number as an ordinal: the. value ``1`` becomes ``1st``, ``3`` becomes ``3rd``, and so on. Values less. than ``1`` are not supported. This formatter is currently hard-coded to use. English ordinals. **""objcclass format**. Example:. ``""method %objcclass0 not found""``. Class:. ``DeclarationName``. Description:. This is a simple formatter that indicates the ``DeclarationName`` corresponds. to an Objective-C class method selector. As such, it prints the selector. with a leading ``+``"". **""objcinstance format**. Example:. ``""method %objcinstance0 not found""``. Class:. ``DeclarationName``. Description:.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

    <reasoning>This content appears to be a discussion about language design trade-offs, specifically regarding switch statements, type uniformity, and the inclusion of memory management instructions (malloc/free). It includes analysis of implementation techniques, potential benefits for code generation (simplifying CFG building), and considerations about bytecode size. The text also references examples from other high-level languages (Java, C++, Fortran) to support its points. While it contains some technical terms and mentions specific functions like 'shl', the substance is primarily a narrative of human-to-human communication discussing design choices and their implications.</reasoning>

",partially correct,"The AI correctly identified that this content should not be eliminated because it contains discussion about language design, but the reasoning provided is flawed. The text does contain technical artifacts (e.g., references to 'shl', 'uint', and programming languages) which might suggest some code or logs are present, but there's no actual code or log in the source text. However, the primary nature of the content appears to be a discussion about design trade-offs, pros/cons, and examples from other languages, making it more akin to human analysis than pure technical artifacts."

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

Module map files use a simplified form of the C99 lexer, with the same rules for identifiers, tokens, string literals, ``/* */`` and ``//`` comments. The module map language has the following reserved words; all other C identifiers are valid identifiers. .. parsed-literal::. ``config_macros`` ``export_as`` ``private``. ``conflict`` ``framework`` ``requires``. ``exclude`` ``header`` ``textual``. ``explicit`` ``link`` ``umbrella``. ``extern`` ``module`` ``use``. ``export``. Module map file. ---------------. A module map file consists of a series of module declarations:. .. parsed-literal::. *module-map-file*:. *module-declaration**. Within a module map file, modules are referred to by a *module-id*, which uses periods to separate each part of a module's name:. .. parsed-literal::. *module-id*:. *identifier* ('. *identifier*)*. Module declaration. ------------------. A module declaration describes a module, including the headers that contribute to that module, its submodules, and other aspects of the module. .. parsed-literal::. *module-declaration*:. ``explicit``:sub:`opt` ``framework``:sub:`opt` ``module`` *module-id* *attributes*:sub:`opt` { *module-member** }'. ``extern`` ``module`` *module-id* *string-literal*. The *module-id* should consist of only a single *identifier*, which provides the name of the module being defined. Each module shall have a single definition. The ``explicit`` qualifier can only be applied to a submodule, i.e., a module that is nested within another module. The contents of explicit submodules are only made available when the submodule itself was explicitly named in an import declaration or was re-exported from an imported module. The ``framew

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",partially correct,"The AI's decision to keep this content is partially correct because it contains a technical artifact (the CMake option description) but lacks sufficient natural language explanation or discussion. The text describes adding an option in CMake, which could be considered as part of build configuration documentation, and the intent appears to be for developers who are configuring the project. However, according to the guidelines, content should be kept if it contains significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion intended for human readers. The text does not provide a detailed narrative or substantial explanation beyond stating what is being done (adding an option) and its default state. It lacks depth in explaining why this change was made or any broader context, which are key elements of meaningful human communication. Therefore, it should be evaluated as lacking the required substance for keeping."

My goal was to write the fastest 3D object viewer that I could, period. Regular programs ought to be written with different goals in mind such as: 1) A program has excellent documentation that ANYONE can read. 2) A program when released has no strange features or bugs. 3) A program is robust and handles ALL extreme and unusual cases. 4) A program is written in phases and modules with hard tests for each one. 5) A program is written for any user who doesn't need special knowledge to use the program. 6) A program has well defined user requirements and functional specifications. 7) A program is written with regard to future expansion and integreation with other systems (portability).

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**

2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

",incorrect,"The AI's output classifies the source text as a license header block, but according to the original prompt, we must evaluate if it should be kept based on whether it contains meaningful human discussion. The source text is primarily a copyright and licensing notice with version control metadata. According to the rules in the original prompt, content that is purely technical artifacts like this should not be considered for elimination unless it lacks primary nature of being code or logs. However, note that the guiding principle states: 'What is the primary purpose of the <source_text>? Is it code, a log, a human discussion, or documentation?' This source text is primarily metadata and legal boilerplate, which does not contain any natural language narrative, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers. It lacks meaningful content that would be considered as communication between humans. Therefore, even though the AI's decision to eliminate it might seem reasonable at first glance (as per Example 2), I must evaluate based on primary nature according to the prompt rules."

Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)

**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)

Vary provides a natural and flexible syntax to define systematic variations that automatically propagate to Filters, Defines and results. RDataFrame usage of columns with attached variations does not change, but for results that depend on any varied quantity, a map/dictionary of varied results can be produced with ROOT::RDF::Experimental::VariationsFor (see the example below). The dictionary will contain a nominal value (accessed with the nominal key) for the unchanged result, and values for each of the systematic variations that affected the result (via upstream Filters or via direct or indirect dependencies of the column values on some registered variations). The keys will be a composition of variation names and tags, e.g. pt:up and pt:down for the example below. In the following example we add up/down variations of pt and fill a histogram with a quantity that depends on pt. We automatically obtain three histograms in output (""nominal"", pt:up and pt:down""): ~~~{.cpp} auto nominal_hx = df.Vary(""pt"", [] (double pt) { return RVecD{pt*0.9, pt*1.1}; }, {""down"", up""}) .Filter(""pt > k"") .Define(""x"", someFunc, {""pt""}) .Histo1D(""x""); auto hx = ROOT::RDF::Experimental::VariationsFor(nominal_hx); hx[""nominal""].Draw(); hx[""pt:down""].Draw(""SAME""); hx[""pt:up""].Draw(""SAME""); ~~~ RDataFrame computes all variations as part of a single loop over the data. In particular, this means that I/O and computation of values shared among variations only happen once for all variations. Thus, the event loop run-time typically scales much better ","

I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)

Vary provides a natural and flexible syntax to define systematic variations that automatically propagate to Filters, Defines and results. RDataFrame usage of columns with attached variations does not change, but for results that depend on any varied quantity, a map/dictionary of varied results can be produced with ROOT::RDF::Experimental::VariationsFor (see the example below).

The keys will be a composition of variation names and tags, e.g. pt:up and pt:down for the example below. In the following example we add up/down variations of pt and fill a histogram with a quantity that depends on pt.

The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.

2105," the way to copy types or declarations from one ``ASTContext`` to another. We refer to the context from which we import as the **""from context** or *source context*; and the context into which we import as the **""to context** or *destination context*. Existing clients of the ``ASTImporter`` library are Cross Translation Unit (CTU) static analysis and the LLDB expression parser. CTU static analysis imports a definition of a function if its definition is found in another translation unit (TU). This way the analysis can breach out from the single TU limitation. LLDB's ``expr`` command parses a user-defined expression, creates an ``ASTContext`` for that and then imports the missing definitions from the AST what we got from the debug information (DWARF, etc). Algorithm of the import. -----------------------. Importing one AST node copies that node into the destination ``ASTContext``. Why do we have to copy the node? Isn't enough to insert the pointer to that node into the destination context? One reason is that the from context may outlive the to context. Also, the Clang AST consider nodes (or certain properties of nodes) equivalent if they have the same address! The import algorithm has to ensure that the structurally equivalent nodes in the different translation units are not getting duplicated in the merged AST. E.g. if we include the definition of the vector template (``#include <vector>``) in two translation units, then their merged AST should have only one node which represents the template. Also, we have to discover *one definition rule* (ODR) violations. For instance, if there is a class definition with the same name in both translation units, but one of the definition contains a different number of fields. So, we look up existing definitions, and then we check the structural equivalency on those nodes.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

rather than to ``[[…]]`` sequences. Compilers that don't. recognize the keyword are likely to report an error of some kind. For example, the ``ArmStreaming`` function type attribute affects. both the type system and the binary interface of the function. It cannot therefore be spelled ``[[arm::streaming]]``, since compilers. that don't understand ``arm::streaming`` would ignore it and miscompile. the code. ``ArmStreaming`` is instead spelled ``__arm_streaming``, but it. can appear wherever a hypothetical ``[[arm::streaming]]`` could appear. Subjects. ~~~~~~~~. Attributes appertain to one or more subjects. If the attribute attempts to. attach to a subject that is not in the subject list, a diagnostic is issued. automatically. Whether the diagnostic is a warning or an error depends on how. the attribute's ``SubjectList`` is defined, but the default behavior is to warn. The diagnostics displayed to the user are automatically determined based on the. subjects in the list, but a custom diagnostic parameter can also be specified in. the ``SubjectList``. The diagnostics generated for subject list violations are. calculated automatically or specified by the subject list itself. If a. previously unused Decl node is added to the ``SubjectList``, the logic used to. automatically determine the diagnostic parameter in `utils/TableGen/ClangAttrEmitter.cpp. &lt;https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/utils/TableGen/ClangAttrEmitter.cpp&gt;`_. may need to be updated. By default, all subjects in the SubjectList must either be a Decl node defined. in ``DeclNodes.td``, or a statement node defined in ``StmtNodes.td``. However,. more complex subjects can be created by creating a ``SubsetSubject`` object. Each such object has a base subject which it appertains to (which must be a. Decl or Stmt node, and not a SubsetSubject node), and some custom code which is. called when determining whether an attribute appertains to the subject. For. instance, a ``NonBitField`` SubsetSubject appe

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

Basic blocks in LLVM are an important part. of functions that define the `Control Flow. Graph &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph&gt;`_. Since we. don't have any control flow, our functions will only contain one block. at this point. We'll fix this in `Chapter 5 &lt;LangImpl05.html&gt;`_ :). Next we add the function arguments to the NamedValues map (after first clearing. it out) so that they're accessible to ``VariableExprAST`` nodes. .. code-block:: c++. if (Value *RetVal = Body-&gt;codegen()) {. // Finish off the function. Builder-&gt;CreateRet(RetVal);. // Validate the generated code, checking for consistency. verifyFunction(*TheFunction);. return TheFunction;. }. Once the insertion point has been set up and the NamedValues map populated,. we call the ``codegen()`` method for the root expression of the function. If no. error happens, this emits code to compute the expression into the entry block. and returns the value that was computed. Assuming no error, we then create an.

    <reasoning>This content describes a technical explanation about compiler construction and LLVM's intermediate representation (IR) generation for functions in C--, specifically focusing on function creation, basic block setup, and code generation steps. It includes detailed explanations of concepts like 'NamedValues' map, the process of clearing it, adding arguments to the function, and using LLVM APIs such as Builder and ValueHandle. The content explains how a compiler handles function calls by creating a new basic block for each expression node in an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) during code generation. It also mentions handling errors and verifying the generated code with `verifyFunction`. This is clearly written in natural language, explaining technical concepts and processes to developers or users of a compiler/LLVM toolchain, so it should be kept.</reasoning>

",partially correct,"The AI's output correctly identifies the source text as containing technical explanation and code snippets. However, the prompt requires filtering content based on primary nature. The source text is a mix of prose (explanation) and code blocks, but its primary substance is instructional or explanatory text about compiler construction with embedded code examples. The original prompt states to keep content that reflects human discussion if it contains natural language explanation. Here, the AI's output correctly identifies this as not being primarily program logs or other non-prose artifacts, so the decision aligns with the guiding principle."
