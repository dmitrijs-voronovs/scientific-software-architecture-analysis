## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

23395,performance,I like your suggestions. Especially the `filter_rank_genes_groups` use makes a lot of sense to me. The one thing I would suggest to take into account is that some of these filtering steps can be done before significance testing and therefore you would not have to perform multiple testing correction on the filtered out genes. This may be quite useful to some. That precludes filtering on p-value though. It also makes a case for filtering already in `rank_genes_groups` rather than in `sc.get`.,"

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State

Regarding the compute instance of EC2, that is a high-end one, but you need to experiment to see what works for you and is within your budget. DeepVariant can also utilize a lot of memory depending on what stage it is running, and how much of the genome your are covering.","The primary architectural concept identified in this text is the optimization of GPU utilization by leveraging multiple CPU cores through parallel processing. The text highlights that while GPUs have more cores than CPUs, they require specific coding and compilation to utilize them effectively. It also mentions that certain tasks, such as those executed on a single GPU core (`make_examples` and `postprocess_variants`), are CPU-based, which can be less efficient in terms of parallel processing compared to GPUs. The text emphasizes the need for careful budgeting when experimenting with different compute instances like EC2.",True,"The identified architectural activity involves optimizing GPU utilization by parallelizing CPU cores, which is a deliberate design decision aimed at improving performance and efficiency. This concept directly relates to the idea of making decisions that influence quality attributes through specific architectural choices.",true,Active Redundancy,"The identified activity involves active redundancy, where multiple components are designed to handle failures and maintain system integrity.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

""Hello,. my issue is similar to the ones above, so I hope you can help me with that.

When I pass in the data just like that, I get a KeyError: 1. . I adjusted the file to have two more columns (with numbers 1:x as gene IDs and a feature types column with Gene Expression in all rows) , but then I get the following Error: ValueError: Length of passed value for var_names is 31054, but this AnnData has shape: (389056, 31053). I think this is because the function treats the column names as values, but I don’t know why. When I look at the features file with pandas, it is displayed correctly. Any suggestions? Thanks a lot in advance!""

It should be easy to support this in Scanpy - the syntax appears to be identical to the old `louvain` innards, and I was able to construct a very minimal dummy function for testing by taking the key bits of `sc.tl.louvain()` and replacing `louvain.` with `leidenalg.:. `",The algorithm is conceptually similar to Louvain but includes an extra collapsed network refinement step.,True,"The extracted sentences indicate that the algorithm's change from Louvain to Leiden introduces a new feature, which could be considered a deliberate design decision. This change might influence specific quality attributes in the codebase.",True,Localize State Storage,"The extracted sentences suggest that replacing `louvain` with `leidenalg` introduces an additional step, which could be seen as a localized state storage mechanism. This aligns with the 'Localize State Storage' tactic, as it involves modifying how states are managed within components to influence system behavior."

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

12165,performance,"? The obvious answer is compile-time: see the performance differences between. C++ and Python, for example. Obvious, but completely wrong, however. In fact, when it comes to Python, it is even the `wrong question.`. Everything in Python is run-time: modules, classes, functions, etc. are all. run-time constructs. A Python module that defines a class is a set of instructions to the Python. interpreter that lead to the construction of the desired class object. A C/C++ extension module that defines a class does the same thing by calling. a succession of Python interpreter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs;. the exact same that Python uses itself internally). If you use a compile-time binder such as `SWIG`_ or `pybind11`_ to bind a C++. class, then what gets compiled is the series of API calls necessary to. construct a Python-side equivalent at `run-time` (when the module gets. loaded), not the Python class object. In short, whether a binding is created at compile-time or at run-time has. no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier. This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying. objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload. resolution based on the unboxed arguments; offset calculations; and finally. the actual dispatch. As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed. by the unboxing and conversion. Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the. run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path. For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects. and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost. Similarly, this is why pybind11 is so slow: its code generation is the C++. compiler's template engine, so complex path selection and specialization is. very hard to do in a performance-portable way.

- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.

In short, whether a binding is created at compile-time or at run-time has. no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.

## Relevant Tactic Names for this Quality Attribute
Manage Sampling Rate, Limit Event Response, Prioritize Events, Reduce Overhead, Bound Execution Times, Increase Resource Efficiency, Increase Resources, Introduce Concurrency, Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations, Maintain Multiple Copies of Data, Bound Queue Sizes, Schedule Resources

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

6724,safety,"Thanks Brad, I now understood your difficulties. You're right, AFAIK, bcl2fastq cannot use a part of index as UMI. . If you use fastp only for processing UMI (without any filtering/adapter/correction), there is a way to do: processing R1+R3 and R2+R3 individually. For example, your command must look like:. ```. fastp -i R1.fq -I R3.fq -o R1.out.fq -O R3.out.fq --umi --umi_loc=read2 --umi_len=6 -Q -A -L -w 1. fastp -i R2.fq -I R3.fq -o R2.out.fq -O R3.out.fq --umi --umi_loc=read2 --umi_len=6 -Q -A -L -w 1. ```. The `-Q -A -L` options disable quality filtering, adapter trimming and length filtering so all input reads will be output, to keep R1.out.fq and R2.out.fq consistent. . You may also specify `-G` to disable polyG end trimming if you're processing data from NextSeq / NovaSeq, but polyG end trimming will not discard reads so it will not break the read consistency. The performance will be mainly unaffected since only R3.fq is loaded twice, which is very small since it's only 6 bp long. And actually you can run these two commands in parallel so that the performance may be even better :). Updated on 1/11/2018: add `-w 1` to the commands to limit the worker threads to keep read order of R1 and R2.","

- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

""Thanks Brad, I now understood your difficulties. You're right, AFAIK, bcl2fastq cannot use a part of index as UMI. . If you use fastp only for processing UMI (without any filtering/adapter/correction), there is a way to do: processing R1+R3 and R2+R3 individually. For example, your command must look like:. ```. fastp -i R1.fq -I R3.fq -o R1.out.fq -O R3.out.fq --umi --umi_loc=read2 --umi_len=6 -Q -A -L -w 1. fastp -i R2.fq -I R3.fq -o R2.out.fq -O R3.out.fq --umi --umi_loc=read2 --umi_len=6 -Q -A -L -w 1. ```. The `-Q -A -L` options disable quality filtering, adapter trimming and length filtering so all input reads will be output, to keep R1.out.fq and R2.out.fq consistent. . You may also specify `-G` to disable polyG end trimming if you're processing data from NextSeq / NovaSeq, but polyG end trimming will not discard reads so it will not break the read consistency. The performance will be mainly unaffected since only R3.fq is loaded twice, which is very small since it's only 6 bp long. And actually you can run these two commands in parallel so that the performance may be even better :). Updated on 1/11/2018: add `-w 1` to the commands to limit the worker threads to keep read order of R1 and R2.""

A minimal number of obvious scripts (with associated documentation) should naturally transition them from source code, through the build phase, and as quickly to the analysis process. Basically less is more, and you do not want to add more to the main directory as you begin to approach version 1.0. So ideally what would be nice is to have one build script - let's call it `build` - that reads a `config/build` directory - and does the following:. 1. Analyzes hidden build-generated files under `.build/...`, and detects if the `prereq` and `build-and-test` phases have been successfully processed. Otherwise, it would report back to the user the build status, and query the user with a recommendation on the next required step to run. For example:. ```. $ build status. Checking DeepVariant build prerequisites... OK. Checking DeepVariant test environment compatibility [GPU]... OK. Checking DeepVariant build binaries... MISSING. Proceed with building binaries [Y/n]? ```. 2. Once the builds have been successfully completed, then it would tell the user the available options to run (i.e. `make_examples`, `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`, `pkrusche/hap.py`, etc.) as well as any analysis that has been completed if a `results` or `analysis-results` folder is present. 3.

""her directories in the tree flowing naturally from it. A minimal number of obvious scripts (with associated documentation) should naturally transition them from source code, through the build phase, and as quickly to the analysis process. Basically less is more, and you do not want to add more to the main directory as you begin to approach version 1.0. So ideally what would be nice is to have one build script - let's call it `build` - that reads a `config/build` directory - and does the following:. 1. Analyzes hidden build-generated files under `.build/...`, and detects if the `prereq` and `build-and-test` phases have been successfully processed. Otherwise, it would report back to the user the build status, and query the user with a recommendation on the next required step to run. For example:. ```. $ build status. Checking DeepVariant build prerequisites... OK. Checking DeepVariant test environment compatibility [GPU]... OK. Checking DeepVariant build binaries... MISSING. Proceed with building binaries [Y/n]? ```. 2. Once the builds have been successfully completed, then it would tell the user the available options to run (i.e. `make_examples`, `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`, `pkrusche/hap.py`, etc.) as well as any analysis that has been completed if a `results` or `analysis-results` folder is present. 3. For Cloud Build, that would also be part of the `build` script, when they provide the `help` argument:. ```. $ ./build help. ... cloudbuild Builds Docker images of DeepVariant, and . pushes them on the Google Container Registry (gcr.io) . ... $ ./build cloudbuild help. CPU Builds a DeepVariant Docker image for CPU usage. GPU Builds a DeepVariant Docker image for GPU usage. Runner Builds a DeepVariant Docker image for large-scale analysis run. using the Genomics Pipelines API. $. ```. Even `Runner` is a bit too general, so maybe calling it `LargeScaleAnalysis`, or something which should be instantly recognizable as to its intended use. Hope it helps,. Paul""

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

4440,performance,"@pichuan @pgrosu This improves my understanding substantially. After reading the paper, my initial impression was that DeepVariant consists of two parts - one part following traditional callers performing local assembly, haplotype detection and candidate allele generation based on the top-two haplotypes, and a second part which is a DNN used to perform candidate filtration. In such a scheme, the second part would be presented a single image per site and it makes a determination among homozygous-ref, heterozygous, and homozygous-alt in an allele-agnostic way - hence it needs a single image per site. In such a caller, 3 allele candidates at a site wouldn't be possible. I was also surprised that such a method could outperform all others, since this approach simply (approximately) replaces the VQSR step in GATK or the RandomForest in Strelka, and a lot would be riding on heuristic-based algorithms for candidate selection. I understand now that all (reasonable) candidates at a site are evaluated and scored against each other using the DNN, which seems to me to be a much more satisfying approach.

- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

","I'm enjoying this brainstorming session... let's continue. I think the most difficult part would be the grid plotting in the end, but let's continue with the points in order. 1. We may need to rethink the scaling. At the moment it's scaled such that 1 is the highest density in one sample. Maybe it's more informative to make all sample densities to sum to 1 for this comparison? I didn't implement that currently as it's currently calculated over cells... if it were over grid points, then each condition would have the same number of grid points and this would be feasible again. 2. I'm not even sure if sampling is necessary... you could just as well take average densities in a grid square. That would make the calculation fairly easy.

- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.

- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

""@vgainullin Ah! Sorry you are right, I miss read your question. Spacy also does not provide this functionality, so it is unlikely we will. It's possible you can call `spacy.cli.download` with a url path, i'm not sure. Regardless, I don't think having models as dependencies is 100% useful (they can be large, you want to cache them in a way you don't want to with normal dependencies) so it's unlikely we will implement this.

## Relevant Tactic Names for this Quality Attribute
Manage Sampling Rate, Limit Event Response, Prioritize Events, Reduce Overhead, Bound Execution Times, Increase Resource Efficiency, Increase Resources, Introduce Concurrency, Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations, Maintain Multiple Copies of Data, Bound Queue Sizes, Schedule Resources

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

So, for each number from 0 to 1000, I need to check two things: whether it's a debug number and whether it's a distro number. If both are true, then it's an overlap point; otherwise, not. But wait, how do I determine if a number is a debug number or a distro number? Hmm, perhaps the numbers represent something else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: The problem says that for each number from 0 to 1000, we need to check whether it's both a debug number and a distro number. So, if a number is in both categories, then it's an overlap point; otherwise, not. But how do I determine which numbers are in the debug category and which are in the distro category? Maybe each number represents something else. Wait, perhaps the problem is about checking whether a given number (from 0 to 1000) is both a debug number and a distro number. So for example, if a number is both even and divisible by 3, then it's an overlap point. But I'm not sure what defines a debug number or a distro number here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about checking whether a given number (from 0 to 1000) can be expressed as a sum of two numbers where one is even and the other is divisible by three. Wait, that might make sense. So for each number N from 0 to 1000, we need to check if there exist integers A and B such that N = A + B, where A is even (divisible by 2) and B is a multiple of 3. If such A and B exist, then N is an overlap point; otherwise, it's not. So the task reduces to checking for each N from 0 to 1000 whether there exists at least one pair (A,B) where A is even, B is divisible by three, and their sum is N. If yes, output ",overlap_point,True,"We need to determine if each number from 0 to 1000 can be expressed as the sum of an even number and a multiple of three. If such a pair exists, then it's an overlap point; otherwise, not.","The approach would involve checking for each N whether there are integers A and B where A is even (A = 2k) and B is divisible by three (B = 3m), such that 2k + 3m = N. We can rewrite this as 3m = N - 2k, which implies that N - 2k must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, for each N, we need to find at least one k such that (N - 2k) is divisible by 3.",Software Upgrade,"The problem requires checking if each number can be expressed as the sum of an even and a multiple of three. This can be done by iterating through each N from 0 to 1000, and for each N, check whether there exists some integer k such that (N - 2k) is divisible by 3. If yes, then N is an overlap point; otherwise, it's not."

- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.

Manage Sampling Rate, Limit Event Response, Prioritize Events, Reduce Overhead, Bound Execution Times, Increase Resource Efficiency, Increase Resources, Introduce Concurrency, Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations, Maintain Multiple Copies of Data, Bound Queue Sizes, Schedule Resources

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

Detect Intrusion, Detect Service Denial, Verify Message Integrity, Detect Message Delay, Identify Actors, Authenticate Actors, Authorize Actors, Limit Access, Limit Exposure, Encrypt Data, Separate Entities, Change Default Settings, Revoke Access, Lock Computer, Inform Actors, Maintain Audit Trail, Restore

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

4744,testability,"Hi @li1ba . For the question about why does the model have a difficult time calling this 1/1 versus 0/1, we have done further investigation. First, it doesn't look like this is a bug in pre-processing or how the data is represented. It seems to be a property of the model. . Second, the property of the model seems to reflect something learned about exome sequencing as opposed to WGS. To determine that, we ran your snippet through both the WGS and WES models. The WGS model is able to confidently call this site as 1/1:. ```. chr2 24146804 . C T 34.1 PASS . GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL 1/1:34:162:0,162:1:34,45,0. ```. When we run the WES model, we replicate your finding (this is with the most recent DeepVariant v1.4, so there is a small difference in the GQ values. . ```. chr2 24146804 . C T 29.3 PASS . GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL 0/1:4:162:0,162:1:26,0,1. ```. This suggests that there is some aspect of exome sequencing that the DeepVariant WES model has learned makes this variant difficult to genotype, possibly because there is some signal that indicates only one allele is present. The reason for this might be some factor which isn't understood (at least by me). This is an interesting observation, but really understanding the reason for a 0/1 call at this position would probably need more investigation (for example, by going into the GIAB training labels for exome sequencing and seeing how often positions that look like this are 0/1 versus 1/1 and trying to understand why). With respect to why your collaborator has different results from you, it's very likely that the difference in mappers has a small effect on which reads are present and how many map discordantly. This small difference pushes the output for the variant on the edge of probabilities between 0/1 an 1/1 to the other side.","

""Hi @li1ba . For the question about why does the model have a difficult time calling this 1/1 versus 0/1, we have done further investigation.

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

At the time we were putting together the vg-giraffe paper, we noticed that Indel errors would occur because the positioning of read indel events in the CIGAR string were not always left-normalized.

Subsequent to that finding, both ourselves and the vg team built methods which left-normalize Indel CIGAR events during processing. We found that this reduced almost all, but not quite all, of the Indel performance difference with ABRA processed reads. Because we have built the DeepVariant vg pipeline to include read normalization with the --normalize_reads=true tag, we don't routinely benchmark the two methods against each other. Our last head-to-head benchmark on ABRA on and off on 35x HG003 was no_ABRA Indel F1=0.9953, with ABRA Indel F1=0.9958. @pichuan Has made [this linked gist](https://gist.github.com/pichuan/eedab4cf2e06fa7ceb2fad0f9b3f8066) that we use for efficient, single machine processing of vg giraffe+DeepVariant.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

---

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

3980,modifiability,"ut it could also be interesting. DeepVariant is trained to assess probabilities of diploid models, and its training data is diploid with some likely minor subclonal acquired variants. We've found that for diploid genomes, the output probabilities (represented as GQ values) are very well calibrated against the empirical error probability, and so are highly informative with respect to the quality of a call. . Subclonal variants will not look like the signature of true germline variants in a diploid organism, and so will not be likely to be assigned a high probability of a variant call. However, it is also the case that subclonal variants will not look like the signature of the noise-derived errors typical for rejected calls.

- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics (with definitions)

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.
