## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

47,energy efficiency,"and maps, RNTuple uses `TClass`. Simple types and other stdlib classes are natively supported and do not require dictionaries. See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple. The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source. A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax. The RBrowser uses RNTuple classes to display RNTuple dataset information. Future Features. ---------------. The following features are planned for after the first RNTuple production version:. - RNTupleProcessor: advanced RNTupleReader that allows for free combination of chains and (indexed/unaligned) friends. - Horizontal merging: persistified friends, analogous to a classical merge being a persistified chain. - An interface for bulk writing. - Meta-data: RNTuple-specific and user-provided meta-data storage, such as file provenance, scale factors, or varied columns. - C library interface. - S3 storage backend (page source / page sink). Semantics of Reading Non-Trivial Objects. ========================================. Reading an object with RNTuple should be seen as _overwriting_ its persistent data members.

""and maps, RNTuple uses `TClass`. Simple types and other stdlib classes are natively supported and do not require dictionaries. See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple. The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source. A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax. The RBrowser uses RNTuple classes to display RNTuple dataset information. Future Features. ---------------. The following features are planned for after the first RNTuple production version:. - RNTupleProcessor: advanced RNTupleReader that allows for free combination of chains and (indexed/unaligned) friends. - Horizontal merging: persistified friends, analogous to a classical merge being a persistified chain. - An interface for bulk writing. - Meta-data: RNTuple-specific and user-provided meta-data storage, such as file provenance, scale factors, or varied columns. - C library interface. - S3 storage backend (page source / page sink). Semantics of Reading Non-Trivial Objects. ========================================. Reading an object with RNTuple should be seen as _overwriting_ its persistent data members. Given a properly constructed and valid object, the object must ensure that it stays valid when overwriting its persistent data members. However, the object should not rely on its transient state to remain unchanged during reading:. it may be destructed and constructed again when it is read as part of a collection (see below). An object that is being read from disk may have been constructed by `RField::CreateValue()`. In this case, the deleter returned by `RField::GetDeleter()` releases the resources. When reading collections of type `T` (`std::vector<T>`, `ROOT::RVec<T>`, ...), RNTuple uses `RField::CreateValue()` to construct elements of the inner type `T`.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

9241,safety,"[ntuple,daos] Support multiple ntuples per container; This pull request introduces ntuple management at the DAOS container level, extending support for more than one ntuple to populate a container. Changes or fixes:. - Support for up to 2\^32 - 1 ntuples in a DAOS container, by assigning an index to a previously-unused portion of the DAOS Object ID address space. The index thus induces a subspace dedicated for all objects belonging to a given ntuple.

""s in an RDataFrame computation graph can introduce serious overheads both in terms of performance and memory usage. In extreme (but very realistic) cases, this leads to OOM crashes. . A flamegraph (attached) can highlight that the main culprit is the allocation/deallocation of very large STL containers (std::map, std::vector), which happens in the machinery of the `RColumnRegister` class. This class has a copy-on-write policy, introduced by https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10899 and further explained at https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11297 . ![many_defines_original](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/15638895/298b9fb4-b18c-4fb8-a103-8a7fccf225a7). For large graphs (O(10K) nodes), we start seeing multiple GBs of memory used just to make the `Define` calls, and a large portion of the total runtime being spent in the destruction of the RDataFrame itself (i.e. at the end of the application the user is stuck at the terminal). The copy-on-write policy is there for a reason. This way, any new branch of the computation graph can share the information about the columns defined (available) for that branch, without being contaminated by information coming from other branches of the graph (this is the cause of the CI errors in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14490 for example). We need to rethink about a way to keep the same functionality that does not incur in the performance/memory usage penalties. Reproducer. ```cpp. include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>. include <string>. include <iostream>. int main(). {. ROOT::RDataFrame df(1);. auto node = df.Define(""col_0"",. [](). { return 42; });. // Increase the number of iterations for a more evident effect. for (std::size_t i = 0; i < 10000; i++). {. node = node.Define(""col_ + std::to_string(i + 1),. [](). { return 42; });. }. std::cout << End of main\n"";. }. ```. ROOT version. Any. Installation method. Built from source. Operating system. Any. Additional context. _No response_""

Where in the original version a TBufferMerger with a file with 1000+ branches and only 50s and ran with any number of threads would take more than 3m (did not wait until the end) the new version takes 11s with 1 thread, 8s with 6 threads and 22s with 6 thread when increased to 500 events.

This PR includes:. * Skipping the boxing/compressing/uncompressing/unboxing cycle if the TBufferMerger is available (not already merging) when the thread is writing its TMemFile. * Skipping SetBranchAddress and SetMakeClass in when doing fast cloning (where that information is not used anyway). * Replacing calling to the slow TObjArray::GetEntries (which counts the slot used) by calling GetEntriesFast. * Speeding up the GetMother implementation (caching parent's address sooner when reading, use that information in GetMother). * In fast cloning, delay writing the output until the last input is processed (instead of writing the output after each input),. * Optimization of fast cloning handing of empty write basket. It also contains a couple of bug fixes (RNtuple merging forgetting to merge the result of the objects in the file, iofeatures incorrectly cloned).

Where in the original version a TBufferMerger with a file with 1000+ branches and only 50s and ran with any number of threads would take more than 3m (did not wait until the end) the new version takes 11s with 1 thread, 8s with 6 threads and 22s with 6 thread when increased to 500 events. (using the CMS file ../data//250202_181_RECO.root). This PR includes:. * Skipping the boxing/compressing/uncompressing/unboxing cycle if the TBufferMerger is available (not already merging) when the thread is writing its TMemFile. * Skipping SetBranchAddress and SetMakeClass in when doing fast cloning (where that information is not used anyway). * Replacing calling to the slow TObjArray::GetEntries (which counts the slot used) by calling GetEntriesFast. * Speeding up the GetMother implementation (caching parent's address sooner when reading, use that information in GetMother). * In fast cloning, delay writing the output until the last input is processed (instead of writing the output after each input),. * Optimization of fast cloning handing of empty write basket. It also contains a couple of bug fixes (RNtuple merging forgetting to merge the result of the objects in the file, iofeatures incorrectly cloned). Also made TBufferMerger::GetQueueSize actually thread safe (it is necessary to use it to stop the producer from adding more data if the queue is too full). Also improved TClass::GetBaseClassOffset parallelism (benefit parallel boxing/unboxing) and reduced/removed contention see in the mechanism use to determine the actual object type at run-time (TIsAProxy).""

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

RLoopManager data source initialization (rev bbf221f). The snapshot action creates a new loop manager which manages the snapshotted data set. The loop manager gets initialized before the actual snapshotting takes place. Originally, the pointer to the data source owned by the loop manager was marked as `const`. Because the RNTuple's data source _has_ to be created after the loop manager, for this PR the `const` qualifier has been dropped. Move `ROOT::RDF::Experimental::FromRNTuple` (rev 0a29b02). For snapshotting RNTuples, we need to include the header file for RNTupleDS in `ActionHelpers.hxx`. To avoid dependency conflicts related to including `ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx`, the free `FromRNTuple` functions have been moved to a separate header. Current limitations and follow-ups. This PR adds the minimal functionality for (single-threaded) snapshotting to RNTuple. A number of follow-ups are foreseen:. RNTuple write options. Currently no RNTuple-specific write options have been added to `RSnapshotOptions` yet, except for compression settings which were already present as an option.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

""[DF] Separate computation graph from dataset it should run on; Explain what you would like to see improved and how. Moving from JIRA: [ROOT-9438](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9438). Advanced users (e.g. TMVA internals) might want to define a computation graph once (e.g. by jitting) and then apply it to several different data-sets or several subsets of a dataset in sequence, without having to re-generate the computation graph each time. The introduction of a new type of head node, a computation manager"", which can attach to different loop managers"", would be one relatively simple way to allow this. Common usage of RDataFrame would remain the same, with the loop manager using a computation manager to speak to the computation graph under the hood. Explicit usage of the computation manager node would allow to attach to different loop managers. At least the schema of the dataset (or the subset that one expects to read) should probably still be known a priori, to allow RDataFrame to error out early in case of misspelled column name, inexistent branch name and so on. To allow the reusage of the same computation graph, actions should not be deleted at the end of the event loop as it is currently done but kept around for the next run. ROOT version. all.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

5822,modifiability,"[ntuple] Provide a page allocator that reuses previous memory allocations; This pull request provides a page allocator that caches previous allocations up to a certain limit. The cache is thread-local and defaults to 16 pages per thread (~1MiB per thread for default-sized pages). This PR is largely based on the concepts in 8634. Reuse of memory allocations in `RPageAllocatorCache` not only reduces calls to the global allocator but also heap fragmentation. The global allocator is thread-safe albeit locked; thus, to also reduce contention, the cache in `RPageAllocatorCache` is thread-local. Given the small size of the (per-thread) cache, the internal structure is a simple `std::deque`. Anything more complex is not justified at the moment of this writing. . **NOTE:** Performance evaluation (specially for the multi-threaded case) should be inserted here tomorrow. Changes or fixes:. - Add `RPageAllocatorCache`: this templated allocator returns pages that have at least the required capacity. `DeletePage()` does not immediately deallocate memory; instead, pages are returned to a thread-local cache, dropping the smallest allocated buffer if the cache is full. If a previous page cannot be recycled, the underlying allocator `AllocT` (`RPageAllocatorHeap` by default) is used to allocate memory. - Change the signature of `RPageSource::UnsealPage()`: `SealPage()`, the counterpart of `UnsealPage()` takes an RPage and returns an RSealedPage. Make the interface of `UnsealPage()` symmetric and return an RPage. - Make `UnsealPage()` use `RPageAllocatorCache` by default. - Remove stray `RPageAllocator{File,Daos}` classes.

""[ntuple] Provide a page allocator that reuses previous memory allocations; This pull request provides a page allocator that caches previous allocations up to a certain limit. The cache is thread-local and defaults to 16 pages per thread (~1MiB per thread for default-sized pages). This PR is largely based on the concepts in 8634. Reuse of memory allocations in `RPageAllocatorCache` not only reduces calls to the global allocator but also heap fragmentation. The global allocator is thread-safe albeit locked; thus, to also reduce contention, the cache in `RPageAllocatorCache` is thread-local. Given the small size of the (per-thread) cache, the internal structure is a simple `std::deque`. Anything more complex is not justified at the moment of this writing. . **NOTE:** Performance evaluation (specially for the multi-threaded case) should be inserted here tomorrow. Changes or fixes:. - Add `RPageAllocatorCache`: this templated allocator returns pages that have at least the required capacity. `DeletePage()` does not immediately deallocate memory; instead, pages are returned to a thread-local cache, dropping the smallest allocated buffer if the cache is full. If a previous page cannot be recycled, the underlying allocator `AllocT` (`RPageAllocatorHeap` by default) is used to allocate memory. - Change the signature of `RPageSource::UnsealPage()`: `SealPage()`, the counterpart of `UnsealPage()` takes an RPage and returns an RSealedPage. Make the interface of `UnsealPage()` symmetric and return an RPage. - Make `UnsealPage()` use `RPageAllocatorCache` by default. - Remove stray `RPageAllocator{File,Daos}` classes. Checklist:. - [X] tested changes locally. - [X] updated the docs (if necessary). This PR supersedes 8634.""

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.

These conditions can be a high bar to meet, so this function can be used to generate a secret of proper quality. customSeed can be anything. It can have any size, even small ones, and its content can be anything, even stupidly low entropy source such as a bunch of zeroes. The resulting `secret` will nonetheless provide all expected qualities. Supplying NULL as the customSeed copies the default secret into `secretBuffer`. When customSeedSize > 0, supplying NULL as customSeed is undefined behavior.""

See https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt for license information. SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception This class implements a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) based packetizing mechanism for VLIW architectures. It provides APIs to determine whether there exists a legal mapping of instructions to functional unit assignments in a packet. The DFA is auto-generated from the target's Schedule.td file. A DFA consists of 3 major elements: states, inputs, and transitions. For the packetizing mechanism, the input is the set of instruction classes for a target. The state models all possible combinations of functional unit consumption for a given set of instructions in a packet. A transition models the addition of an instruction to a packet. In the DFA constructed by this class, if an instruction can be added to a packet, then a valid transition exists from the corresponding state. Invalid transitions indicate that the instruction cannot be added to the current packet.""

- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.

- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

The purpose of this document is to. both capture some of this high level information and also describe some of the. design decisions behind it. This is meant for people interested in hacking on. Clang, not for end-users. The description below is categorized by libraries,. and does not describe any of the clients of the libraries. LLVM Support Library. ====================. The LLVM ``libSupport`` library provides many underlying libraries and. `data-structures <https://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html>`_, including. command line option processing, various containers and a system abstraction. layer, which is used for file system access. The Clang Basic Library. =========================. This library certainly needs a better name. The basic library contains a. number of low-level utilities for tracking and manipulating source buffers,. locations within the source buffers, diagnostics, tokens, target abstraction,. and information about the subset of the language being compiled for. Part of this infrastructure is specific to C (such as the ``TargetInfo``. class), other parts could be reused for other non-C-based languages. (``SourceLocation``, ``SourceManager``, ``Diagnostics``, ``FileManager``). When and if there is future demand we can figure out if it makes sense to. introduce a new library, move the general classes somewhere else, or introduce. some other solution. We describe the roles of these classes in order of their dependencies. The Diagnostics Subsystem. -------------------------. The Clang Diagnostics subsystem is an important part of how the compiler. communicates with the human. Diagnostics are the warnings and errors produced. when the code is incorrect or dubious. In Clang, each diagnostic produced has. (at the minimum) a unique ID, an English translation associated with it, a. :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` to put the caret"", and a severity.

""Sorry about the delay, I've been working on some writing about this stuff (though from a different perspective). I'm not sure `k` is meant to have any particular effect, since these methods weren't designed for KNN graphs. I'd also argue if the parameters are analogous, there's an advantage of simplicity to just choosing one of them. I've got some plots for the effect of resolution and number of neighbors on the size of clusters which are found. This is for the 10x example dataset with 10k pbmcs using the v3 chemistry.

- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.

981,deployability,"address (`RA`) on stack. Various mitigation techniques (e.g. `SafeStack`_, `RFG`_, `Intel CET`_). try to detect or prevent `RA` corruption on stack. RCFI enforces the expected control flow in several different ways described below. RCFI heavily relies on LTO. Leaf Functions. --------------. If `f()` is a leaf function (i.e. it has no calls. except maybe no-return calls) it can be called using a special calling convention. that stores `RA` in a dedicated register `R` before the `CALL` instruction. `f()` does not spill `R` and does not use the `RET` instruction,. instead it uses the value in `R` to `JMP` to `RA`. This flavour of CFI is *precise*, i.e. the function is guaranteed to return. to the point exactly following the call. An alternative approach is to. copy `RA` from stack to `R` in the first instruction of `f()`,. then `JMP` to `R`. This approach is simpler to implement (does not require changing the caller). but weaker (there is a small window when `RA` is actually stored on stack). Functions called once. ---------------------. Suppose `f()` is called in just one place in the program. (assuming we can verify this in LTO mode). In this case we can replace the `RET` instruction with a `JMP` instruction. with the immediate constant for `RA`. This will *precisely* enforce the return control flow no matter what is stored on stack. Another variant is to compare `RA` on stack with the known constant and abort. if they don't match; then `JMP` to the known constant address. Functions called in a small number of call sites. ------------------------------------------------. We may extend the above approach to cases where `f()`. is called more than once (but still a small number of times). With LTO we know all possible values of `RA` and we check them. one-by-one (or using binary search) against the value on stack. If the match is found, we `JMP` to the known constant address, otherwise abort. This protection is *near-precise*, i.e. it guarantees that the control flow wi","

""address (`RA`) on stack. Various mitigation techniques (e.g. `SafeStack`_, `RFG`_, `Intel CET`_). try to detect or prevent `RA` corruption on stack. RCFI enforces the expected control flow in several different ways described below. RCFI heavily relies on LTO. Leaf Functions. --------------. If `f()` is a leaf function (i.e. it has no calls. except maybe no-return calls) it can be called using a special calling convention. that stores `RA` in a dedicated register `R` before the `CALL` instruction. `f()` does not spill `R` and does not use the `RET` instruction,. instead it uses the value in `R` to `JMP` to `RA`. This flavour of CFI is *precise*, i.e. the function is guaranteed to return. to the point exactly following the call. An alternative approach is to. copy `RA` from stack to `R` in the first instruction of `f()`,. then `JMP` to `R`. This approach is simpler to implement (does not require changing the caller). but weaker (there is a small window when `RA` is actually stored on stack). Functions called once. ---------------------. Suppose `f()` is called in just one place in the program. (assuming we can verify this in LTO mode). In this case we can replace the `RET` instruction with a `JMP` instruction. with the immediate constant for `RA`. This will *precisely* enforce the return control flow no matter what is stored on stack. Another variant is to compare `RA` on stack with the known constant and abort. if they don't match; then `JMP` to the known constant address. Functions called in a small number of call sites. ------------------------------------------------. We may extend the above approach to cases where `f()`. is called more than once (but still a small number of times). With LTO we know all possible values of `RA` and we check them. one-by-one (or using binary search) against the value on stack. If the match is found, we `JMP` to the known constant address, otherwise abort. This protection is *near-precise*, i.e. it guarantees that the control flow wi""

- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.
