## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.

- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to properly classify the tactics from the provided list. The source text discusses an abstract attribute framework with concepts like Attributor, getAAFor method, updateImpl, and fixpoint iteration. However, the available tactics in the prompt are categorized into three main types: Detect Faults, Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair, and Recover from Faults_Reintroduction. The AI's response does not align any specific tactic to these categories based on the source text content.

The output field 'tactic' is set to 'nan', which indicates no classification or identification of a relevant tactic. This contradicts the task requirement as there are multiple tactics mentioned in the prompt that could be applied, such as Active Redundancy, Passive Redundancy, etc., but none were correctly identified by the AI.

Furthermore, the response field is vague and does not demonstrate how it was derived from the source text. It states a general description without specifying which tactic(s) are relevant or providing reasoning based on the source text's content about abstract attributes and their dependencies."

"" 32-bit floats. - A new `RNTupleInspector` utility class has been added, to provide information about the on-disk metadata of an RNTuple. - A new `RNTupleParallelWriter` class has been added, providing (initial) support for parallel writing of RNTuples. - A new static method `RFieldBase::Check()` has been added, which produces a support status report of a type with regards to RNTuple I/O. - A new internal `RNTupleMerger` class has been added, enabling the merging of different page sources into one page sink. This also means that RNTuples can be merged through `hadd`. - Zero-copy bulk reading has been added, with extra optimizations for `ROOT::RVec` fields. - It is now possible to use the `RNTupleView` with an external address with type erasure, e.g.:. ```cpp. std::shared_ptr&lt;void&gt; data{new float()};. auto view = reader-&gt;GetView(""pt"", data);. ```. This enables use cases such as reading one specific entry of one specific field into a previously allocated memory location. - Further integration with [RDataFrame](#rdataframe): it is now possible to create RDataFrame for chains of RNTuples. This addition also comes with improvements to the multi-threaded work scheduling. - Many additional bug fixes and improvements. Please, report any issues regarding the above mentioned features should you encounter them. RNTuple is still in pre-production. The on-disk format is scheduled to be finalized by the end of 2024.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect. The original prompt requires analyzing the source text based on specific tactics from the provided list. However, the AI only outputs one tactic field with 'nan', which does not follow any of the specified rules or tactics.

First, I analyzed the goal: The task was to analyze the text using available tactics and provide a JSON output that includes at least two fields - one for the tactic(s) applied (or identified as relevant) and another for the response. According to the prompt, it should be based on the rules provided in the Available Tactics section.

Then, I analyzed the source text: The user is describing issues with ROOT7 implementations causing build failures on Mac due to invalid expressions found online, mentioning inability to test locally because of not owning a Mac, and assuming that failing tests are related to additional attributes changing file sizes. They also suggest updating roottest values.

Next, I scrutinized the AI's output: It has only one tactic field with 'nan', which is clearly incorrect as it doesn't specify any tactic from the list. The response field seems partially relevant but lacks proper structure and does not align well with the prompt's requirements for a JSON-based evaluation.

The main issue is that no tactics were correctly identified or applied by the AI, making its primary conclusion flawed. Therefore, according to my strict evaluation criteria, this output should be classified as 'incorrect'."

",incorrect,"The AI output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'nan'. According to the original prompt, we must analyze the text and provide a JSON output with specific fields. The source text discusses accumulating features from arch, cpu, and fpu, which relates to resource monitoring (metering or static classification) because it involves collecting data about computational devices. However, the AI's response does not correctly identify any tactic; it provides an overly generic explanation that doesn't align with the available tactics provided in the prompt. The text is describing a process of accumulating and appending features, which could be related to resource allocation (horizontal scaling for energy efficiency) or perhaps service adaptation if we consider dynamic switching based on collected data. But without explicitly matching one of the defined tactics from the list, the classification should not have been left as 'nan'. Moreover, the response field in the output is incorrect because it introduces concepts like sensor infrastructure and benchmarking that are not mentioned in the source text. The source text only mentions accumulating features separately (from arch, cpu, fpu) and appending for architecture extensions - there's no mention of sensors or real-time data collection. Also, while horizontal scaling might be loosely related to energy efficiency by adding/removing resources based on demand, this tactic is specifically about adding additional servers/VMs etc., not directly about accumulating features from hardware components. The AI failed to correctly apply the rules and provide a justified classification."

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly applies the rules. The original prompt requires analyzing tactics and text to provide JSON output, but the tactic 'Tailor Interface' is relevant as it involves buffering capabilities.

However, the response field in the AI's output does not accurately reflect the source text. The source text discusses supporting larger buffers (imperative changes) and addresses backward compatibility by suggesting a special flag for file creation to prevent opening with old ROOT versions. But the AI's response states that 'the system adds or removes capabilities' which is vague, whereas the text specifically talks about adding a special flag for backward compatibility.

Moreover, the source text does not mention anything about removing capabilities; it focuses on supporting larger buffers and using a special flag to maintain compatibility with older systems. The AI's response incorrectly implies that both addition and removal of capabilities are happening, which is not supported by the text.

Additionally, while 'Tailor Interface' might be applicable due to buffering mentioned in the tactic description, the reasoning provided does not align well with the source text content about backward compatibility concerns."

## Text To Analyze:
""If p-values are regarded as a valuable output rather than just the ranks, it might be worth recomputing as thresholding would ease the multiple testing burden. I guess that's the idea behind the `min_pCells` parameter request.""

    <response>The system is being asked about recomputing p-values to avoid thresholding and its impact on multiple testing burden, referencing a specific parameter called 'min_pCells'.</response>

</evaluation_data>
",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'nan', which is not applicable. According to the original prompt, I must analyze the source text and available tactics to determine if it applies any of them.

First, let's understand the goal: The task is to identify which Quality Assurance (QA) tactics are being referenced or implied in the provided text.

The source text discusses recomputing p-values as a way to avoid thresholding in order to ease multiple testing burden. It also mentions a specific parameter 'min_pCells'. This relates to managing complexity and potential nondeterminism in system behavior, which falls under the 'Limit Complexity' category of QA tactics.

Now, examining the available tactics:
- Control and Observe System State: Includes strategies like providing specialized interfaces or storing state locally. The text doesn't mention any such interfaces or storage mechanisms.
- Limit Complexity: This includes reducing structural complexity and limiting nondeterminism. The idea of recomputing p-values to avoid thresholding suggests a way to manage the multiple testing issue, which could be seen as an attempt to limit nondeterminism (by avoiding arbitrary thresholds) or perhaps reduce structural complexity by rethinking how tests are performed.

The text specifically references 'min_pCells' parameter. This implies that there is some system state being controlled or observed through this parameter, but it's not explicitly detailed. However, the overall concept aligns with the goal of limiting complexity in testing.

Therefore, the tactic should be classified as one under 'Limit Complexity'. The AI incorrectly used 'nan', which means no applicable tactic was found. This is wrong because there are relevant tactics that apply to this text."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'nan'. According to the original prompt, I must analyze the text based on available tactics and classify it. The source text describes a system that updates scenes conditionally (if marked changed or not) with fine granularity control without resetting state. This aligns closely with 'Condition Monitoring' from the available tactics list, which involves checking conditions to prevent faulty behavior. However, the AI output does not provide any classification at all, only marking it as 'nan'. Additionally, while the response is a summary of what the system does, it fails to correctly identify and justify the specific tactic being applied by the source text. The prompt requires identifying one or more tactics from the provided list that are used in the described behavior, but the AI output has no tactic specified except for an incorrect 'nan' value.

",incorrect,"The AI's output classifies the text as 'nan' (no applicable tactics) but according to the original prompt rules, we must analyze for specific architectural tactics. The source text discusses test configuration and exclusion of certain tests, which could relate to tactics like 'Limit Nondeterminism', 'Abstract Data Sources', or even 'Control and Observe System State'. However, the AI's response does not identify any tactic from the available list; it simply states there is no applicable tactic. This contradicts the prompt requirement to provide a JSON output with at least one tactic field if relevant tactics are present in the text. The reasoning provided by the AI ('without specifying an architectural tactic') is too vague and fails to justify why none of the listed tactics apply, especially since the text does mention testing-related concerns that might align with some tactics."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

All material properties changes are undoable. The mixture editor. currently allows adding elements one by one in the mixture composition. This can be done either by element weight fraction or by number of. atoms. Once an element was added using one method the other method is not. selectable anymore. Summing component fractions up to 1 in the final. mixture is the user responsibility. Adding materials as components of a. mixture is not supported in this version. The elements that were added to the mixture appear in the bottom of the. mixture editor. The operations performed on mixture are not undoable. Creation of New Objects. As described above, all geometry object creators are accessible within. the geometry manager editor frame. Generally, if the new object that. needs to be created does not depend on other objects, it will be built. with a set of default parameters. This is the case for all shapes.

Volumes are hierarchical components in the geometry, therefore their. editor is more complex. It provides the following functionalities:. - *General*.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to properly analyze and apply the available tactics. The source text describes a bug in the `sc.pp.highly_variable_genes` function, but the AI incorrectly labels this as an 'in-place modification' issue without considering the broader context of fault handling strategies.

First, let's review the original prompt's rules: It provides several tactics including Detect Faults (monitoring), Recover from Faults (active redundancy, degradation, reconfiguration), Prevent Faults (removal from service), Resist Attacks (authorize actors, limit access), and Control and Observe System State (specialized interfaces, sandbox, executable assertions).

The source text contains a detailed bug report about the `sc.pp.highly_variable_genes` function altering the log transformation base in-place. This behavior is problematic because it overrides user-specified settings.

Now, examining the AI's output: It states that the system has an 'in-place modification' issue and labels this as falling under the tactic category of 'nan'. However, looking at the available tactics:
- None directly address in-place modifications except perhaps through broader fault recovery mechanisms like degradation or reconfiguration.

But more importantly, let's map the bug to the appropriate tactics from the prompt:
1. The issue is about a function modifying data without explicit permission (changing log base). This could relate to 'Authorize Actors' under Resist Attacks if we consider unintended modifications as an attack vector.
2. Alternatively, it might be seen as a fault in the system's operation that needs detection via one of the Detect Faults tactics.

However, the AI incorrectly assigns this bug to no specific tactic (using 'nan') and fails to provide any reasoning or classification based on the available tactics list provided in the prompt.

Moreover, the response does not align with any of the tactical categories properly. The description mentions that `sc.pp.highly_variable_genes` modifies the layer used by changing the base of log transformation without user consent - this is a clear violation and should be classified under 'Authorize Actors' or perhaps as an exception detection fault.

But crucially, the AI's output does not follow any of these categories. It simply says there's an issue with in-place modification but doesn't map it to any available tactic from the prompt.

Therefore, according to the evaluation criteria:
- The main decision or classification is wrong because the AI did not correctly apply one of the tactical classifications provided in the original prompt."

- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output classifies the tactic as 'Removal from Service', but this is incorrect. The source text discusses specifying versions and handling SubtargetFeatures under FPURestriction, which does not align with any of the available tactics in the original prompt. Specifically, it mentions returning static StringRefs and noting that certain features are only valid under a specific condition (FPURestriction::None). None of these actions correspond to 'Removal from Service', which involves temporarily placing a component out of service. The text does not describe any removal or degradation action; instead, it focuses on detailed specification and conditional listing. Therefore, the primary classification is wrong."

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to identify any applicable tactics from the provided list. The source text describes a change in how TTreeProcessorMT handles chains and trees, specifically introducing chain-based operations to support friends (tree/chain friends). This aligns with several available tactics: 
1. **Reduce Coupling** - by encapsulating or using an intermediary.
2. **Defer Binding** - through runtime binding methods like plug-ins or dynamic lookup.
The tactic 'Chain Support' is not explicitly listed, but the description of extending roottest and implementing a new way suggests tactics such as 'Refactor', 'Abstract Common Services', or perhaps 'Use an Intermediary'. However, the AI output only lists 'nan' which indicates no applicable tactic was identified. This makes the primary decision incorrect."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

",incorrect,"The AI output to verify is incorrect. The tactic field should not be 'nan' but must select one or more tactics from the available list provided in the original prompt. Additionally, the response does not align with any of the specified tactics because it fails to properly categorize the functionality described in the source text according to the rules for each tactic.

The original prompt requires analyzing the source text against the available tactics and providing a JSON output that includes at least one tactic from the list along with a corresponding response. The AI's output has an empty 'tactic' field (with value 'nan') which violates this rule, making it incorrect regardless of other content.

Furthermore, even if we consider the source text for functionality related to authentication and manipulation capabilities, none of the tactics in the prompt directly match the described features. For instance:
- The function allows adding, editing or deleting entries (which could relate to 'Cancel', but that is about terminating commands; or perhaps aspects of 'Support User Initiative' like 'Undo' if state changes are tracked).
- However, there's no explicit mention in the source text about user being able to cancel, undo, pause, aggregate, etc., nor does it describe system tasks for maintaining models. The response field attempts to summarize but doesn't correctly map any part of this functionality to a specific tactic from the list without proper justification.

Therefore, since the primary decision (classification) is wrong due to missing tactics and lack of correct mapping, the output is incorrect."

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it fails to properly apply the available tactics from the original prompt. The source text describes two main changes: renaming 'rdf_uuid' and introducing a new type 'ExecutionIdentifier', along with merging two classes into one. However, the AI only mentions addressing comments and splitting commits (which might relate to commit messages or code structure), but does not identify any of the available tactics from the prompt that are being applied in the source text.

The original prompt provides three categories of tactics: Separate the User Interface, Support User Initiative, and Support System Initiative. The AI's response field states 'The system has addressed comments by splitting commits...', which is vague and does not align with any specific tactic listed. While commit splitting might be a way to organize code (possibly under 'Separate the User Interface' or 'Co-locate related responsibilities'), it is not explicitly mentioned in the source text as being done for user interface reasons.

Furthermore, the AI's output includes a <tactic> field with value 'nan', which does not correspond to any of the available tactics.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

The original prompt requires analyzing the text for applicable tactics from the list provided. The source text discusses a library-based architecture with requirements like clean APIs, decoupling, and ease of modification/extension. These concepts align with several available tactics:
- Reduce Size of a Module (Splitting) is not directly mentioned.
- Increase Cohesion: There's no mention of moving responsibilities to reduce side effects.
- Reduce Coupling: The text describes building tools as libraries which implies encapsulation and decoupling, but the AI didn't identify any tactic from this list. It also mentions clean APIs (which relates to encapsulation) and ease of modification/extension (which relates to refactoring).
- Defer Binding: No binding at compile time or runtime is discussed.

The response field in the output should have provided a mapping to specific tactics, but it only gives a generic description. The tactic field being 'nan' means no tactic was found, which contradicts the content of the response."

- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.

However, according to the original prompt, I must analyze the text based on the available tactics provided in the prompt. The text describes multiple module loadings occurring within the system. Upon examining the source text, it appears that several components are being loaded or checked for functionality, including monitoring (e.g., 'Cling_Runtime already loaded', which could be part of a monitor tactic), condition monitoring (as Cling_Runtime and MathCore might be involved in checking conditions like TRandom), active redundancy is not evident as all modules seem to be loaded without parallel processing mentioned. The response field states that the system is loading various modules, but it does not classify or identify any specific fault management tactic from the list provided. Therefore, since no applicable tactic was identified and the output only describes what's happening without applying any of the tactics (like detect faults, prevent faults, etc.), the main decision or classification is wrong because 'nan' implies no tactic found, but there might be multiple relevant ones in the text that should have been considered.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.

""and in registers. First, a recap. The endianness of an item affects its representation in memory only. In a register, a number is just a sequence of bits - 64 bits in the case of AArch64 general purpose registers. Memory, however, is a sequence of addressable units of 8 bits in size. Any number greater than 8 bits must therefore be split up into 8-bit chunks, and endianness describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory. A little endian layout has the least significant byte first (lowest in memory address). A big endian layout has the *most* significant byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and so forth. ``LDR`` and ``LD1``. ===================. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ldr.png. :align: right.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'Degradation'. According to the source text, there is mention of a significant degradation of GL performance due to ATI drivers. However, this degradation was observed in older driver versions and has been resolved in the latest ones. The tactic should be classified under 'Degradation' only if it describes a system's intentional design to handle faults by degrading functions. In this case, while there is an example of degraded performance (due to faulty drivers), the source text does not explicitly state that Eve or its components intentionally employ degradation as a fault tolerance mechanism. The AI incorrectly assumes that the described performance issue constitutes a tactic for fault tolerance, whereas it was actually caused by external factors and fixed in updates."

",incorrect,"The AI output is incorrect because it fails to properly apply the tactics from the prompt. The <original_prompt> provides a list of available tactics for resource management in an event-driven system context, but the source text discusses code refactoring and compatibility issues with KNeighborsTransformer in Scanpy (a Python library). There is no direct connection between the tactics listed and the content being analyzed.

The tactic field should not be 'nan' as it implies none of the provided tactics are relevant. However, upon closer inspection, none of the available tactics seem to directly apply to this source text which is about software development and code compatibility rather than resource management or event processing in a system context.

Additionally, the response does not align with any tactic from the prompt because:
- The source text mentions changing logic for predictability (backwards compatibility issue), but no tactics address such changes directly.
- There are references to TODO items and specific code sections that need attention, which don't correspond to resource management tactics.

Therefore, since there is a mismatch between the task described in the prompt and the source text content, the evaluation must be 'incorrect'."

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Resource Monitoring
- **Metering**: Collecting data about the energy consumption of computational devices via a sensor infrastructure in real time.
- **Static Classification**: Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- **Scheduling**: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- **Brokering**: Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.

#### Resource Adaptation
- **Service Adaptation**: Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Co-locating resources and removing intermediaries and abstractions to reduce computational overhead and energy demands.

",partially correct,"The AI output correctly identified the tactic as 'Scheduling' from the available tactics, but its response is flawed. The source text describes a scheduler in :program:`llvm-mca` that groups instructions and manages execution based on operand availability, which aligns with the definition of Scheduling under Resource Allocation. However, the response does not accurately reflect all aspects mentioned in the source text. It mentions 'groups instructions into sets' but fails to specify the three distinct sets (WaitSet, ReadySet, IssuedSet) as detailed in the source text. Additionally, it states that the scheduler manages execution through dynamic resource allocation, which is partially correct since the scheduler does track data dependencies and dynamically select resources, but this aspect alone doesn't fully justify the classification without mentioning the specific grouping mechanism described."

",incorrect,"The AI's output is incorrect because it does not properly apply the available tactics from the prompt to the source text. The original prompt requires analyzing specific tactics (Control and Observe System State, Limit Complexity) against the provided text. However, the AI only outputs a single tactic field with 'nan', which indicates no applicable tactic was identified. This is flawed because the source text contains multiple elements that could be mapped to these tactics.

For example, regarding Control and Observe System State:
- The system explicitly stores state in three sets (WaitSet, ReadySet, IssuedSet) as per 'Localize State Storage'.
- It provides specialized interfaces for controlling/observing component variables/states through the scheduler's functionality.
- There is mention of record/playback via the state transitions and operand availability checks.

Regarding Limit Complexity:
- The system limits nondeterminism by using deterministic scheduling algorithms (round-robin selector).
- It reduces structural complexity by having a clear separation between scheduler, resource manager, and other components.

The AI's response does not correctly identify or justify any of these tactics. Instead, it provides an overly broad description that is not specific to the available tactics framework. The 'nan' value in the tactic field suggests no analysis was performed according to the prompt rules."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'Maintain task models'. According to the source text, it describes an iterator pointing at a Then predicate and creating the largest block of continuous predicated instructions. This does not align with any available tactics in the original prompt.

Available tactics include:
- Separate the User Interface: The text discusses instruction processing which is unrelated to user interface responsibilities.
- Support User Initiative: No mention of user actions or commands being canceled, undone, paused, etc., so this doesn't apply.
- Support System Initiative: 'Maintain task models' refers to understanding user context for system assistance. However, the source text does not describe any system attempting to determine user intent; it's about processing instructions based on a predicate and iterator, which is more operational than modeling tasks.

The closest available tactic might be 'Maintain task models' if we interpret the block identification as part of maintaining context for potential assistance. But in this case, there's no explicit mention of system determining user intent or providing feedback; it's purely about creating a block mask based on an iterator and predicate without any indication that this is done to model tasks.

Therefore, while 'Maintain task models' could be loosely interpreted as part of the process if we consider the block identification helps in maintaining context for potential system assistance (which falls under Support System Initiative), it's not a direct match. The source text doesn't mention anything about modeling or determining user/system intent; it simply describes an algorithmic process.

Moreover, the response field is incorrect because it rephrases the action as 'system attempts to identify' which implies intentionality and context determination that isn't present in the original tactic description. The AI's output should have been more specific about matching one of the available tactics precisely."

- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

The tactic field should be empty or contain a placeholder if no tactic is identified, but 'nan' implies missing data and may not align with the expected format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Text To Analyze:
""he code is working before making a release is the test suite. Running the tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to test scanpy. To run the tests first make sure you have the required dependencies (`pip install -e .[test,dev]""`), then run `pytest` from the root of the repository. It can take a while to run the whole test suite. There are a few ways to cut down on this while working on a PR:. 1. Only run a subset of the tests. This can be done with the `-k` argument from pytest (e.g. `pytest -k test_plotting.py` or `pytest -k test_umap*""`. 2. Run the tests in parallel. If you install the pytest extension [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) you can run tests in parallel with the `--numprocesses` argument to pytest (e.g. `pytest -n 8`). Miscellaneous tips. - A lot of warnings can be thrown while running the test suite. It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples. If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the source text under the tactic 'Vertical Scaling'. The source text describes a strategy for thread allocation based on CPU sockets, which aligns more with resource allocation rather than vertical scaling. Vertical scaling typically involves changing individual resources (like CPU speed or memory) to meet demand, whereas horizontal scaling adds/removes additional servers/VMs. However, in this context, the tactic 'Vertical Scaling' is misapplied because the text does not mention adjusting single resources but instead focuses on distributing threads across sockets and using a default strategy for specific cases. The response provided by the AI also contains generic reasoning about dynamically adjusting resources that does not specifically reference or justify based on the source text's content, which only discusses thread allocation strategies without mentioning scaling up or down of other types of resources. Therefore, the main decision to classify this under 'Vertical Scaling' is flawed and incorrect."

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'Removal from Service'. According to the original prompt, this tactic involves temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state. However, the source text describes json::OStream and its usage for writing JSON directly without materializing structures, which is about efficiency and safety but does not involve removing any component from service. The tactics provided are: Detect Faults (monitoring), Recover from Faults (active redundancy, degradation, reconfiguration), Prevent Faults (removal from service). None of these categories match the description in the source text. The source text discusses a method for JSON output that is lower-level and faster but less safe, with examples of emitting attributes and arrays directly without higher-level abstractions. This does not align with any tactic listed under 'Prevent Faults' or other categories. Specifically, it doesn't mention removing components from service to prevent faults; instead, it focuses on the direct manipulation of JSON output structures for safety and efficiency."

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

",partially correct,"The AI's output indicates that the system was supposed to analyze text for security-related tactics. However, upon examining the source text, it describes a hardened allocator called Scudo and its design features. The prompt provided available tactics including 'Detect Attacks', 'Resist Attacks', etc., but none of these directly relate to an allocator or memory management as described in the source text.

The AI's response states that the system is describing the Scudo Hardened Allocator, which aligns with understanding the task from the original prompt. However, it fails to identify any specific tactic from the available list that applies to this description. The output field 'tactic' contains only 'nan', meaning no applicable tactic was identified.

According to the rules in the original prompt, we must analyze based on the provided tactics and determine which ones are relevant or present in the text. In this case, none of the tactics listed (Detect Attacks, Resist Attacks, React to Attacks, Recover from Attacks) seem directly applicable to an allocator's design description.

Therefore, while the main decision about the system describing an allocator is correct, there was no identification of any tactic that applies, making at least one part flawed. The output should have indicated 'nan' for all tactics or provided reasoning why none apply, but it only shows a single field with 'nan'. This does not fully justify the evaluation as per prompt rules."

- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

The source text describes an issue with ROOT code regarding shared library loading when sub-directory names start with a dot. The available tactics include options like bounding execution times and managing resource demand, which are relevant to event processing and system performance.

But the AI's output only references one tactic 'Bound Queue Sizes', even though there might be multiple applicable tactics or it should have provided all that apply according to instructions.

Moreover, the response does not accurately reflect how bounding queue sizes would address this issue.

",incorrect,"The AI's output incorrectly classifies the tactic as 'nan'. According to the original prompt, I must analyze the text and provide a JSON output with specific fields. The source text describes a system that returns true for faster code sequences in an instruction chain ending in \p Root, and mentions sorting patterns by priority. This aligns with the 'Separate the User Interface' tactic's description of localizing user interface responsibilities and making critical choices without recoding. However, the AI fails to identify this correctly because it does not map the functionality to any available tactic properly. The response field is accurate but incomplete as it doesn't specify which tactic was applied or if there are multiple.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
