You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.

    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""

See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple. The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source. A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax. The RBrowser uses RNTuple classes to display RNTuple dataset information. Future Features. ---------------. The following features are planned for after the first RNTuple production version:. - RNTupleProcessor: advanced RNTupleReader that allows for free combination of chains and (indexed/unaligned) friends. - Horizontal merging: persistified friends, analogous to a classical merge being a persistified chain. - An interface for bulk writing. - Meta-data: RNTuple-specific and user-provided meta-data storage, such as file provenance, scale factors, or varied columns. - C library interface. - S3 storage backend (page source / page sink). Semantics of Reading Non-Trivial Objects. ========================================. Reading an object with RNTuple should be seen as _overwriting_ its persistent data members. Given a properly constructed and valid object, the object must ensure that it stays valid when overwriting its persistent data members. However, the object should not rely on its transient state to remain unchanged during reading:. it may be destructed and constructed again when it is read as part of a collection (see below). An object that is being read from disk may have been constructed by `RField::CreateValue()`. In this case, the deleter returned by `RField::GetDeleter()` releases the resources. When reading collections of type `T` (`std::vector&lt;T&gt;`, `ROOT::RVec&lt;T&gt;`, ...), RNTuple uses `RField::CreateValue()` to construct elements of the inner type `T`. As the size of a collection changes from event to event</sentence>

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

Here's a first draft in Python of our tools:. https://github.com/saezlab/dorothea-py. https://github.com/saezlab/progeny-py.

Examples of usage:. * Used as input for NN. * Used as input for integration methods. 2) New data assays (`X`). Examples of usage:. * Plot feature activities in projections such as PCA or UMAP. * Plot feature activities in heat-maps, clustermaps, violin plots, etc. * Differences between groups can be modeled to find significant differences. Because of this duality, the integration of our tools into scanpy is not straightforward. If we store the activities in `obsm` they can be used as a dimensonality reduction embedding but then we lose acces to all the fantastic plotting functions based on `X`. Then if we add add our activities to `X`, they have a very different distribution than gene expression plus there would be an overlap of names between genes and TFs. A solution to this would be to have a separate `.layer` to store this matrices but layers must contain the same dimensions as `X`. Another workaround would be to store it in `.raw` but then we force the user to use remove its previous contents, plus it is used in some methods as default which could cause problems. .

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.

<evaluation_data>
    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

    </original_system_prompt>
    <original_prompt>
    
Based on the rules provided, analyze the following available tactics and text and provide the JSON output.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

4419,modifiability,"o allow easy deduction of new attributes as well as information exchange between abstract attributes in-flight. The Attributor class is the driver and the link between the various abstract attributes. The Attributor will iterate until a fixpoint state is reached by all abstract attributes in-flight, or until it will enforce a pessimistic fix point because an iteration limit is reached. Abstract attributes, derived from the AbstractAttribute class, actually describe properties of the code. They can correspond to actual LLVM-IR attributes, or they can be more general, ultimately unrelated to LLVM-IR attributes. The latter is useful when an abstract attributes provides information to other abstract attributes in-flight but we might not want to manifest the information. The Attributor allows to query in-flight abstract attributes through the `Attributor::getAAFor` method (see the method description for an example). If the method is used by an abstract attribute P, and it results in an abstract attribute Q, the Attributor will automatically capture a potential dependence from Q to P. This dependence will cause P to be reevaluated whenever Q changes in the future. The Attributor will only reevaluate abstract attributes that might have changed since the last iteration. That means that the Attribute will not revisit all instructions/blocks/functions in the module but only query an update from a subset of the abstract attributes. The update method `AbstractAttribute::updateImpl` is implemented by the specific abstract attribute subclasses. The method is invoked whenever the currently assumed state (see the AbstractState class) might not be valid anymore. This can, for example, happen if the state was dependent on another abstract attribute that changed. In every invocation, the update method has to adjust the internal state of an abstract attribute to a point that is justifiable by the underlying IR and the current state of abstract attributes in-flight.

- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

<evaluation_data>
    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

This PR includes:. * Skipping the boxing/compressing/uncompressing/unboxing cycle if the TBufferMerger is available (not already merging) when the thread is writing its TMemFile. * Skipping SetBranchAddress and SetMakeClass in when doing fast cloning (where that information is not used anyway). * Replacing calling to the slow TObjArray::GetEntries (which counts the slot used) by calling GetEntriesFast. * Speeding up the GetMother implementation (caching parent's address sooner when reading, use that information in GetMother). * In fast cloning, delay writing the output until the last input is processed (instead of writing the output after each input),. * Optimization of fast cloning handing of empty write basket. It also contains a couple of bug fixes (RNtuple merging forgetting to merge the result of the objects in the file, iofeatures incorrectly cloned). Also made TBufferMerger::GetQueueSize actually thread safe (it is necessary to use it to stop the producer from adding more data if the queue is too full). Also improved TClass::GetBaseClassOffset parallelism (benefit parallel boxing/unboxing) and reduced/removed contention see in the mechanism use to determine the actual object type at run-time (TIsAProxy).</sentence>

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.

- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.

Implementation. As mentioned, the existing `Snapshot` interface is used. A new `SnapshotRNTupleHelper` has been created to handle the creation and writing of the RNTuple, akin to the existing `SnapshotHelper` (which has been renamed to `SnapshotTTreeHelper` for consistency). RLoopManager data source initialization (rev bbf221f). The snapshot action creates a new loop manager which manages the snapshotted data set. The loop manager gets initialized before the actual snapshotting takes place. Originally, the pointer to the data source owned by the loop manager was marked as `const`. Because the RNTuple's data source _has_ to be created after the loop manager, for this PR the `const` qualifier has been dropped. Move `ROOT::RDF::Experimental::FromRNTuple` (rev 0a29b02). For snapshotting RNTuples, we need to include the header file for RNTupleDS in `ActionHelpers.hxx`.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling

- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

However, these rice genomes were diploid and with a similar variant density of. humans. DeepVariant is currently written to be a diploid variant caller. So if the plant. species you are working with is polyploid, it is not yet clear how DeepVariant. will perform. That is because even with re-training, DeepVariant can only. produce variant calls that are homozygous alternate, heterozygous, or homozygous. reference, which don't have much meaning in a tetraploid genome, for example. Can I use DeepVariant on other non-human species? See this. [blog post](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2018-12-05-improved-non-human-variant-calling-using-species-specific-deepvariant-models/). How do I build/run DeepVariant? In general, we recommend running DeepVariant using Docker for the simplest. setup. If you are building from source because you want to experiment with. changes to the codebase, we still recommend Docker. You can clone the. DeepVariant repo, modify the source code, and build a Docker image with your. changes using the provided Dockerfile. Why can't it find one of the input files? E.g., Could not open"". This often happens because the way Docker works, input and output directories. have to be mounted and then files are referred to by their mounted location,. which can be confusing. To check that files are visible inside the Docker. container, you can `ls` inside the container. For example, using the setup shown. in the README and looking inside the `/input` volume:. ```. BIN_VERSION=""1.6.1"". docker run \. -v YOUR_INPUT_DIR"":""/input \. -v YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR:/output \. google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION} \. ls /input. ```. Mounting directories </sentence>

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.

- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.

- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

1802,integrability,"Thanks, this is very helpful to pinpoint what is happening! So what's going on here is that within one gene (column), all cells (rows) have the almost same float value. This causes the variance per gene to be ~0, usually just a tiny value, in this dataset e.g. on the order of 1e-21. Handling such tiny values, tiny offsets due to numerics can yield negative values for the variance. When doing np.sqrt() [here](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/fdfb9a1a48d480a30c23e5f14499a18a6388e418/src/scanpy/preprocessing/_scale.py#L186C5-L186C23) on such a nan, this yields this entire gene column to obtain nans. From our side, this could be addressed by considering to set such tiny negative values to 0. `sklearn` circumvents this by directly [computing the standard deviation](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/2621573e60c295a435c62137c65ae787bf438e61/sklearn/preprocessing/_data.py#L248) from numpy, which likely has such a mechanism within it directly. However, trying to scale a feature of a constant value should be omitted in the first place very likely: as scaling involves dividing by standard deviation (which is ~0 then), the resulting numbers obtained are not actual biology, but just artifacts from a stability correction. I'd assume that in scRNAseq, this typically is a gene which is never observed (that is, 0 all the time), and as such could be filtered for in the preprocessing with e.g. `sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_counts=...)`, where `a` would be a number > 0. We might consider to raise a warning here though, as just introducing the nans without further comment can be quite confusing... What do you think about this @sophiamaedler?","

## Available Tactics

#### Locate
- **Discover Service**: Locates a service through searching a known directory service at runtime.

#### Manage Interfaces
- **Orchestrate**: Uses a control mechanism to coordinate, manage and sequence the invocation of particular servicess that could be ignorant of each other.
- **Tailor Interface**: Adds or removes capabilities to an interface, such as translation, buffering, or hiding particular functions from untrusted users.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

Notable changes in behavior. - Using `Alias`, it is now possible to register homonymous aliases (alternative column names) in different branches of the computation graph, in line with the behavior of `Define` (until now, aliases were required to be unique in the whole computaton graph). - The `Histo*D` methods now support the combination of scalar values and vector-like weight values. For each entry, the histogram is filled once for each weight, always with the same scalar value. - The `Histo*D` methods do not work on columns of type `std::string` anymore. They used to fill the histogram with the integer value corresponding to each of the characters in the string. Please use `Fill` with a custom class to recover the old behavior if that was what was desired. Other improvements. - The scaling to a large amount of threads of computation graphs with many simple `Filter`s or `Define`s has been greatly improved, see also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1036730/#1-a-performance-study-of-the-r) for more details. - The output format of `Display` has been significantly improved. - The `Fill` method now correctly supports user-defined classes with arbitrary `Fill` signatures (see [#9428](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9428)). Experimental Distributed RDataFrame. The distributed RDataFrame module has been improved. Now it supports sending RDataFrame tasks to a [Dask](https://dask.org/) scheduler. Through Dask, RDataFrame can be also scaled to a cluster of machines managed through a batch system like HTCondor or Slurm. Here is an example:. ```python. import ROOT. from dask.distributed import Client. RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Dask.RDataFrame. In a Python script the Dask client needs to be initalized in a context. Jupyter notebooks / Python session don't need this. if __name__ == __main__"":. client</sentence>

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

    </original_system_prompt>
    <original_prompt>
    
Based on the rules provided, analyze the following available tactics and text and provide the JSON output.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Binding values at runtime using the publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Shared Repositories**: Binding values at runtime through shared repositories.
- **Polymorphism**: Binding values at runtime using polymorphism.

<evaluation_data>
    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

    </original_system_prompt>

Based on the rules provided, analyze the following available tactics and text and provide the JSON output.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

""[RF] New way to fix compute graph with `RooAbsArg::compileForNormSet()`; For the new RooFit BatchMode, the model pdf had to be compiled for a. fixed normalization set before being evaluated by the RooFit driver. This step was implemented in a rather hacky way, because it only became. clear gradually how important this step is, as many changes need to be. done to the computation graph before it can be used by the BatchMode. It started by unrolling the normalization integrals such that they are. separate nodes that can be evaluated by the RooFit driver.

- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.

- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction

- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

",System-Level Design,correct,The user asked me to write a query for the following:
1306,energy efficiency,"Great, thank you, @andrea-tango and @Koncopd! @andrea-tango, would you make a PR? We can then look at how you solved this. In principle, I'm very hesitant to add `diffxpy` as a dependency of Scanpy. It depends on Tensorflow itself, which is a large dependency. What would be OK would be to have a wrapper in `scanpy.external`, but I don't know whether this makes sense. Why not using `diffxpy`s Volcano plots right away? Regarding the discrepancy between `wilxocon` in `diffxpy` and `scanpy`. There obviously shouldn't be any and there also shouldn't be duplicated code, here, at all. The only reason that Scanpy has its own Wilcoxon implementation was that there was no implementation available that would scale to large sparse data. That's why @tcallies wrote the present implementation about 1.5 years ago. He benchmarked with scipy's Wilcoxon test. @davidsebfischer, can you shed light on why and how you implemented your Wilcoxon? Shouldn't we have a comparison? At the time, @tcallies wrote [this](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage/blob/master/171106_t-test_wilcoxon_comparison/Generic%20Comparison%20T-Test%20Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum%20Test.ipynb) and these [tests](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/master/scanpy/tests/test_rank_genes_groups.py). How did you write your tests? We were just talking about `log2FC`, which is such a simple quantity and should evidently be properly computed by `rank_genes_groups`. We just had this other PR on it (https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/pull/519). @tcallies, any thoughts from your side?","

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Resource Monitoring
- **Metering**: Collecting data about the energy consumption of computational devices via a sensor infrastructure in real time.
- **Static Classification**: Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- **Scheduling**: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.

- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.
- **Name Servers**: Binding values at runtime using name servers.
- **Plug-ins**: Binding values at runtime through plug-ins.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators. Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. Wha</sentence>

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

- **Static Classification**: Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- **Scheduling**: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- **Brokering**: Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.

#### Resource Adaptation
- **Service Adaptation**: Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Co-locating resources and removing intermediaries and abstractions to reduce computational overhead and energy demands.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.

- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

LLVM support libraries (for example, `ADT. &lt;https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT&gt;`_). implement specialized data structures or functionality missing in the standard. library. Such libraries are usually implemented in the ``llvm`` namespace and. follow the expected standard interface, when there is one. When both C++ and the LLVM support libraries provide similar functionality, and. there isn't a specific reason to favor the C++ implementation, it is generally. preferable to use the LLVM library. For example, ``llvm::DenseMap`` should. almost always be used instead of ``std::map`` or ``std::unordered_map``, and. ``llvm::SmallVector`` should usually be used instead of ``std::vector``. We explicitly avoid some standard facilities, like the I/O streams, and instead. use LLVM's streams library (raw_ostream_). More detailed information on these. subjects is available in the :doc:`ProgrammersManual`. For more information about LLVM's data structures and the tradeoffs they make,. please consult `that section of the programmer's manual. &lt;https://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#picking-the-right-data-structure-for-a-task&gt;`_.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

The module maps will be written using the `module map language`_, which provides the tools necessary to describe the mapping between headers and modules. Because the set of headers differs from one system to the next, the module map will likely have to be somewhat customized for, e.g., a particular distribution and version of the operating system. Moreover, the system headers themselves may require some modification, if they exhibit any anti-patterns that break modules. Such common patterns are described below. **Macro-guarded copy-and-pasted definitions**. System headers vend core types such as ``size_t`` for users. These types are often needed in a number of system headers, and are almost trivial to write. Hence, it is fairly common to see a definition such as the following copy-and-pasted throughout the headers:. .. parsed-literal::. ifndef _SIZE_T. define _""

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

This means we won't need localstarts and localends. &gt; IIUC the redundant info is that globalend = globalstart + (localends - localstarts).sum() (i.e. we could avoid passing globalend). You can avoid passing `localstarts` and `localends`, since you can calculate them from `globalstart, globalend, filelist, treesnentries`. The latter is what I expect we would need if we use RDF with a configuration object: globalstart and globalend would be included in the configuration object to represent a range in the dataset, and `filelist` and `treesnentries` would be used to construct the TChain with which we would construct the RDF.</sentence>

## Available Tactics

#### Resource Monitoring
- **Metering**: Collecting data about the energy consumption of computational devices via a sensor infrastructure in real time.
- **Static Classification**: Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- **Scheduling**: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- **Brokering**: Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.

#### Resource Adaptation
- **Service Adaptation**: Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Co-locating resources and removing intermediaries and abstractions to reduce computational overhead and energy demands.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

<evaluation_data>
    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

2707,modifiability,"Sorry about the delay, I've been working on some writing about this stuff (though from a different perspective). I'm not sure `k` is meant to have any particular effect, since these methods weren't designed for KNN graphs. I'd also argue if the parameters are analogous, there's an advantage of simplicity to just choosing one of them. I've got some plots for the effect of resolution and number of neighbors on the size of clusters which are found. This is for the 10x example dataset with 10k pbmcs using the v3 chemistry. What I've done is build the networks at 5 different values of k, four times each (different random seeds). For each of those networks, I ran clustering at 50 different resolutions (`np.geomspace(0.05, 20, 50)`).

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.

    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.

- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

<evaluation_data>
    <original_system_prompt>
    
You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.

- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Faults
- **Ping/Echo**: An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
- **Monitor**: A component that monitors the state of health of various parts of the system such as processors, processes, I/O, and memory.
- **Heartbeat**: A fault detection mechanism that employs periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored.
- **Timestamp**: Used to detect incorrect sequences of events by assigning the state of a local clock to events immediately after they occur.
- **Sanity Checking**: Checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.
- **Self-Test**: Components can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Passive Redundancy**: A configuration where only active members process input traffic and provide redundant spares with periodic state updates.
- **Spare**: Cold sparing where redundant spares remain out of service until a fail-over occurs.
- **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms employed to handle detected exceptions using information to mask the fault.
- **Rollback**: Permits the system to revert to a previous known good state upon detection of a failure.
- **Software Upgrade**: Achieves in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner.
- **Retry**: Assumes that the fault causing a failure is transient and retrying the operation may lead to success.
- **Ignore Faulty Behavior**: Calls for ignoring messages from a particular source when determined to be spurious.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Recover from Faults_Reintroduction
- **Shadow**: Operates a previously failed component in ""shadow mode"" for a predefined duration before reverting it to an active role.
- **State Resynchronization**: Ensures that failed components are brought back to a consistent state with active components.
- **Escalating Restart**: Allows system recovery by varying the granularity of components restarted while minimizing service impact.
- **Non-Stop Forwarding**: Splits functionality into control and data planes to continue operations while recovering the supervisory information.

#### Prevent Faults
- **Removal from Service**: Temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state to mitigate potential system failures.
- **Transactions**: Ensures that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- **Predictive Model**: Used with monitors to ensure a system operates within nominal parameters and take corrective action for conditions predictive of future faults.
- **Exception Prevention**: Techniques employed to prevent system exceptions from occurring.
- **Increase Competence Set**: Expanding the set of states in which a program is competent to operate to handle more cases as part of normal operation.

## Available Tactics

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Record/Playback**: Capturing the state when it crosses an interface to allow that state to be used to ""play the system back"" and re-create faults.
- **Localize State Storage**: Storing state in a single place to make it easier to set the system to an arbitrary state for testing.
- **Abstract Data Sources**: Designing interfaces to easily substitute test data without changing functional code.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

#### Limit Complexity
- **Limit Structural Complexity**: Reducing dependencies between components, simplifying inheritance hierarchies, and increasing cohesion to make behavior more predictable and easier to test.
- **Limit Nondeterminism**: Finding and eliminating sources of unpredictable behavior to make testing more reliable.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Reduce Size of a Module
- **Split Module**: Refining a module into several smaller modules to reduce the average cost of future changes.

#### Increase Cohesion
- **Increase Semantic Coherence**: Moving responsibilities that don't serve the same purpose to different modules to reduce the likelihood of side effects.

#### Reduce Coupling
- **Encapsulate**: Introducing an explicit interface to a module to reduce the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules.
- **Use an Intermediary**: Breaking a dependency between responsibilities by using an intermediary that depends on the type of dependency.
- **Restrict Dependencies**: Restricting the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on through visibility or authorization.
- **Refactor**: Factoring out common responsibilities from modules where they exist and assigning them an appropriate home to reduce duplication.
- **Abstract Common Services**: Implementing similar servicess once in a more general (abstract) form to reduce modification costs.

#### Defer Binding
- **Component Replacement**: Binding values at compile time or build time through replacement in build scripts or makefiles.
- **Compile-time Parameterization**: Binding values at compile time through parameterization.
- **Aspects**: Binding values at compile time or build time using aspects.
- **Configuration-time Binding**: Binding values at deployment time through configuration.
- **Resource Files**: Binding values at startup or initialization time using resource files.
- **Runtime Registration**: Binding values at runtime through registration.
- **Dynamic Lookup**: Binding values at runtime through dynamic lookup for servicess.
- **Interpret Parameters**: Binding values at runtime by interpreting parameters.
- **Startup Time Binding**: Binding values at runtime during startup.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

## Available Tactics

#### Control Resource Demand
- **Manage Sampling Rate**: Reduce the frequency at which environmental data is captured to decrease demand, typically with some loss of fidelity.
- **Limit Event Response**: Process events only up to a set maximum rate to ensure more predictable processing when events are processed.
- **Prioritize Events**: Impose a priority scheme that ranks events according to how important it is to service them.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Reduce the resources consumed in processing an event stream by removing intermediaries.
- **Bound Execution Times**: Place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event.
- **Increase Resource Efficiency**: Improve the algorithms used in critical areas to decrease latency.

#### Manage Resources
- **Increase Resources**: Use faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks to reduce latency.
- **Introduce Concurrency**: Process requests in parallel to reduce the blocked time.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Computations**: Use multiple servers in a client-server pattern as replicas of computation to reduce the contention.
- **Maintain Multiple Copies of Data**: Keep copies of data on storage with different access speeds to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses.
- **Bound Queue Sizes**: Control the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals.
- **Schedule Resources**: Understand the characteristics of each resource's use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it.

## Text To Analyze:
""Hi Philippe,. . &gt; it might be impossible to avoid synonyms that are semantically distincts ... a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules).

The drawback is that we would then not have a solution outside TThreadedObject, i.e. we will have to find a way to force the use of TThreadedObject in MT cases. &gt; A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock). Not sure to understand, you mean FindObject? I will have a closer look. &gt; A 4th deficiency is that once activated for one histogram it seems to apply to all histogram. i.e. as far as can tell if you one parallel histograms and 10,000 single-thread histograms, filling the single-thread histogram still has to go through the multi-thread registration/mechanism. Ok, a solution per histogram would also address this. Thanks for going deep into it,. Gerri.""

<sentence>I encountered the same problem, when I created a small artificial `AnnData` with a single gene in `gene_list` for some unit test. Here is my analysis of the problem:. In this line. https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/63141908601632638db8a79e8a1dfa8509cd27af/scanpy/tools/_score_genes.py#L182. `control_genes` was actually empty, hence the index error. The reason for the empty `control_genes` genes is. https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/63141908601632638db8a79e8a1dfa8509cd27af/scanpy/tools/_score_genes.py#L173. `control_genes` contained some genes before (in my artificial case only one), but they are removed here, since the genes in `control_genes` also appeared in `gene_list`. I think this is where the bug resides:. I assume `control_genes` should not contain genes from `gene_list` in the first place. Hence, this line. https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/63141908601632638db8a79e8a1dfa8509cd27af/scanpy/tools/_score_genes.py#L167. would need to be changed/complemented:.

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

- **Condition Monitoring**: Involves checking conditions in a process or device to prevent a system from producing faulty behavior.
- **Voting**: Employs multiple components that do the same thing with identical inputs and forwards their output to voting logic to detect inconsistencies.
- **Exception Detection**: The detection of a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Recover from Faults_Preparation and Repair
- **Active Redundancy**: A configuration where all nodes receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing redundant spares to maintain synchronous state with active nodes.
- **Degradation**: Maintains critical system functions in the presence of component failures by dropping less critical functions.
- **Reconfiguration**: Recovers from component failures by reassigning responsibilities to remaining functional resources.

#### Prevent Faults

#### Resist Attacks
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.

#### Control and Observe System State
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Providing test-specific interfaces that allow testers to control or observe component variables and states that might otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Sandbox**: Isolating the system from the real world to enable experimentation without permanent consequences.
- **Executable Assertions**: Placing code at strategic locations to indicate when a program is in a faulty state.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
- **Limit Exposure**: Minimizing the attack surface of a system by reducing the number of access points for resources, data, or servicess and connectors that may provide unanticipated exposure.
- **Encrypt Data**: Protecting data from unauthorized access by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication.
- **Separate Entities**: Separating different entities within the system through physical separation, virtual machines, air gaps, or separation of sensitive from nonsensitive data.
- **Change Default Settings**: Forcing users to change default settings to prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through publicly available settings.

#### React to Attacks
- **Revoke Access**: Severely limiting access to sensitive resources when the system or administrator believes that an attack is underway.
- **Lock Computer**: Limiting access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer.
- **Inform Actors**: Notifying relevant personnel or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack.

#### Recover from Attacks
- **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keeping a record of user and system actions and their effects to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker.
- **Restore**: Restoration of servicess after an attack using tactics that deal with recovering from a failure.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

- **Static Classification**: Statically classifying devices and computational resources based on benchmarking or reported device characteristics when real-time data collection is infeasible.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Using dynamic models that take into consideration transient conditions to determine energy consumption when real-time data collection is infeasible.

#### Resource Allocation
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding or activating resources to meet processing demands, or removing/deactivating resources when demands no longer require them.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding additional servers, VMs, or resources to an existing pool for scaling up, or removing/idling such resources for energy efficiency.
- **Scheduling**: Allocating tasks to computational resources to optimize energy usage while respecting task constraints and priorities.
- **Brokering**: Matching service requests with service providers based on energy information to allow choosing providers based on their energy characteristics.

#### Resource Adaptation
- **Service Adaptation**: Dynamically switching computational resources to ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Improving the time or memory performance of critical algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, or matching service requests to hardware best suited for those requests.
- **Reduce Overhead**: Co-locating resources and removing intermediaries and abstractions to reduce computational overhead and energy demands.

## Available Tactics

#### Separate the User Interface
- **Increase semantic coherence**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Encapsulate**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Co-locate related responsibilities**: Localizes user interface responsibilities to a single place.
- **Restrict dependencies**: Minimizes the ripple effect to other software when the user interface changes.
- **Defer binding**: Lets you make critical user interface choices without having to recode.

#### Support User Initiative
- **Cancel**: Allows the user to terminate a command with appropriate resource management and notification.
- **Undo**: Maintains sufficient information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored at the user's request.
- **Pause/resume**: Provides the ability to temporarily free resources so they may be reallocated to other tasks.
- **Aggregate**: Allows operations to be applied to a group of objects, freeing the user from repetitive operations.

#### Support System Initiative
- **Maintain task models**: Determines context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting and provide assistance.
- **Maintain user models**: Explicitly represents the user's knowledge of the system to control response time and assistance.
- **Maintain system models**: Determines expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.

You are an expert in software architecture tactics. Your task is to analyze user-provided text and identify the single most specific software architecture tactic being described from a list I will provide.

## Guiding Principles
- Focus on the Mechanism: Identify the architectural *how* (the solution or feature), not the *why* (the benefit).
- Handle Non-Feature Descriptions: If the text is a user question, bug report, installation issue, or a general discussion *about* the software rather than a description of a feature *within* the software, you **must** classify the tactic as `None`.

## Your Task
You will be given a list of ""Available Tactics"" and a ""Text to Analyze"". Based on these, provide a single JSON object with two fields:
1.  `tactic`: The name of the single most specific tactic you identified from the provided list, or `None`.
2.  `response`: A one-sentence summary of the functionality described, starting with ""The system..."". If the tactic is `None`, summarize the user's query or the text's purpose.

---
### Example of Handling a Non-Feature
- Text: ""Tensorflow version of the model checkpoint; What is the version of tensorflow for generating the checkpoint files (`index`, `meta`, `data`)? And is there any way that I can load these checkpoints into a standalone tensorflow program and then dump it as a `.onnx` file?""
  - `tactic`: None
  - `response`: The system is being asked about its TensorFlow version and how to convert its model checkpoints to another format.
---
You will now be provided with the list of available tactics and a text to analyze. Apply these rules to the text that follows.

## Available Tactics

#### Detect Attacks
- **Detect Intrusion**: Comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database.
- **Detect Service Denial**: Comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
- **Verify Message Integrity**: Employment of techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files.
- **Detect Message Delay**: Detection of potential man-in-the-middle attacks by checking the time that it takes to deliver a message to identify suspicious timing behavior.

#### Resist Attacks
- **Identify Actors**: Identifying the source of any external input to the system, typically through user IDs, access codes, IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Authenticate Actors**: Ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be through passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
- **Authorize Actors**: Ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or servicess through access control mechanisms.
- **Limit Access**: Limiting access to computing resources such as memory, network connections, or access points by using memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol.
