You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")->plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**

reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out. The goal is to identify and **keep** content that consists of meaningful human-written prose, explanation, or analysis intended for human readers, and to **filter out** content that is primarily non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.

### Keep Content That:
- Is written for human readers and contains **significant natural language, explanation, commentary, analysis, or discussion**.
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, critiques, or explanations of implementation strategies and trade-offs. This includes bug reports and detailed commit messages.
- Includes **scientific, academic, or detailed technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized.
- **Crucially:** This content should be kept **even if it is embedded within or formatted as** technical artifacts (like code comments, log snippets, or documentation with tags). The key is the **substance and intent** of the natural language text. The ratio of prose to code is not the determining factor.

### Eliminate Content That:
- Is **primarily** composed of non-prose programmatic or technical artifacts, **lacking a significant natural language narrative, explanation, or discussion**.
- Consists mainly of:
 - **Pure executable code or formal syntax** (e.g., function bodies without comments, simple variable declarations) without an explanatory narrative.
 - **Program output, logs, or error traces** presented without any surrounding human analysis or interpretation.
 - **Formal configuration, data structures, or build specifications lacking explanatory comments/text** (e.g., pure YAML/JSON data, simple Makefile rules).
 - **Version control metadata lacking explanatory commit messages** (e.g., diff hunks, file path changes).
 - **Formal API signatures or technical interface definitions** without accompanying prose that explains their purpose and usage in a descriptive way.
 - **Boilerplate text** that does not provide any unique insight or explanation, such as standard license or copyright headers.

## Examples (for reference only – do not analyze):

### Example 1 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
Build failed on ROOT-ubuntu2004/python3.; Running on root-ubuntu-2004-3.cern.ch:/home/sftnight/build/...; Failing tests:; - projectroot.test.test_stressgraphics_interpreted
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a program-generated build log. It consists entirely of diagnostic artifacts and lacks human-written analysis or explanation.

### Example 2 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
scanpy.neighbors.connectivities. scanpy.neighbors.distances. scanpy.neighbors.eigen_basis.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a list of API functions. It is a technical artifact and lacks any human-written narrative, commentary, or explanation.

### Example 3 (Keep)
**Content:**
I tested the new parallelization strategy. Simulation time dropped 30%, but memory usage increased. We may need more efficient data structures.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a natural language explanation of performance trade-offs and a suggestion for future work. It is a clear example of human-to-human communication.

### Example 4 (Keep)
**Content:**
[RF] Wrong integral value, possibly problems with some global caching. It seems `ws.pdf(""""signal"""")-&gt;plotOn(frame);` creates some global cache of the integral which is used with newly created objects, causing the issue.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This is a bug report that describes a technical problem and analyzes the potential cause (`global caching` from a specific function call). This is valuable human-written analysis, not just a log.

### Example 5 (Keep)
**Content:**
@name Mutation APIs
These methods provide APIs for submitting updates to the DominatorTree. Note: There are two strategies, Eager and Lazy. It is recommended to use the Lazy strategy for multiple updates to improve performance.
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: false
reasoning: This content, despite using documentation tags like `@name`, provides a detailed explanation of two different technical strategies and gives a recommendation. The substance is a human-written explanation of design and trade-offs.

### Example 6 (Eliminate)
**Content:**
History:
Version 17.8, add new method GetDXDY()
Version 17.7, updates in the TUnfold implementation
Version 17.5, fix memory leak
**Answer:**
to_eliminate: true
reasoning: This is a structured changelog that is simply a list of changes. It lacks a narrative or detailed explanation of the *reasons* for the changes, making it a low-value technical artifact.
