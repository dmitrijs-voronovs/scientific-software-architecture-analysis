To do this, `AddBin()` calls the; 124`AddBinToPartition()` method.; 125This method adds the input bin to the partitioning matrix.; 126 ; 127The number of partition cells per axis can be specified in the constructor.; 128If it is not specified, the default value of 25 along each axis will be; 129assigned.

What I did was I first shelled into the container. Then I checked the files in `/opt/deepvariant/bin/` in the container because I tried to look for the `run_deeptrio` file, which could not be found when I followed steps in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/docs/deeptrio-quick-start.md#notes-on-singularity and gave the error message as in the title of this issue. Was it possible that I missed anything when running Deeptrio?. Thanks.

If you have bad samples, then skip those. If you want to see the difference among samples, train then individually, but that will generate multiple per-sample-biased models.

",True,"The content includes various function declarations and operator overloading methods related to memory management (`operator delete`, `operator new`). These functions are crucial for proper resource allocation and deallocation in C++. The presence of these operators supports safe memory handling, which contributes to the overall safety of the system by preventing memory leaks and ensuring that resources are properly managed. Additionally, there are method declarations like `Pop()`, `Print()`, `Read()`, `RecursiveRemove()`, `ResetBit()`, and others. These methods likely handle data safely, possibly by validating inputs or managing state correctly. The `Safety` class has functions such as `Double_tSafety()` and `voidSafety_v()`, which seem to check for safe conditions and handle potential errors. Functions like `SafetyPhi()` and `SafetySeg()` calculate geometric safety parameters, ensuring that the system operates within safe boundaries.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.

",True,"The content describes an issue where the number of samples (n_samples) is less than the number of features (n_features), specifically when n_samples is 40 and n_features is 100, leading to a failure in the PCA decomposition process during preprocessing with scanpy. The problem arises from the constraints imposed by PCA requiring that the number of samples must be greater than or equal to the number of components chosen for dimensionality reduction. This relates to usability because it affects the efficiency of data processing and analysis tasks, potentially impacting user productivity and task completion time.","

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @anands-repo . You are correct, subsampling is static. A nice effect of this is that it reduces the complexity in terms of training reproducibility. We have not deeply investigated whether dynamic resampling (making a different image per epoch) would benefit training. It's an interesting question. It could potentially reduce overfitting that might occur at the read level and therefore allow training to progress through more epochs before a model is selected. . I think it is unlikely that this would improve the current production training setup, but it is not impossible. For the WGS training curves, there is little overfitting apparent in training graphs over a large number of epochs. For the WES training curves, some overfitting is apparent, but we suspect this is less due to signal from the read level and more due to the smaller number of regions represented in the exome. This is one reason that we currently train the exome model by warmstarting from the WGS model.

Performance,"ormals are assumed to be preserved. Running LLVM code in an environment where these assumptions are not met can lead; to undefined behavior. The ``strictfp`` and ``denormal-fp-math`` attributes as; well as :ref:`Constrained Floating-Point Intrinsics <constrainedfp>` can be used; to weaken LLVM's assumptions and ensure defined behavior in non-default; floating-point environments; see their respective documentation for details. .. _floatnan:. Behavior of Floating-Point NaN values; -------------------------------------. A floating-point NaN value consists of a sign bit, a quiet/signaling bit, and a; payload (which makes up the rest of the mantissa except for the quiet/signaling; bit). LLVM assumes that the quiet/signaling bit being set to ``1`` indicates a; quiet NaN (QNaN), and a value of ``0`` indicates a signaling NaN (SNaN). In the; following we will hence just call it the ""quiet bit"". The representation bits of a floating-point value do not mutate arbitrarily; in; particular, if there is no floating-point operation being performed, NaN signs,; quiet bits, and payloads are preserved. For the purpose of this section, ``bitcast`` as well as the following operations; are not ""floating-point math operations"": ``fneg``, ``llvm.fabs``, and; ``llvm.copysign``. These operations act directly on the underlying bit; representation and never change anything except possibly for the sign bit.

Content: WALSH, FOUR-HAAR transform. These need fSizex*2*fSizey length to supply real and imaginary coefficients.; fDest-pointer to the matrix of destination data, its size should be fSizex*fSizey except for direct FOURIER, FOUR-WALSh, FOUR-HAAR. These need fSizex*2*fSizey length to store real and imaginary coefficients; fSizex,fSizey-basic dimensions of source and dest spectra. Transform methods; Goal: to analyse experimental data using orthogonal transforms. orthogonal transforms can be successfully used for the processing of nuclear spectra (not only); they can be used to remove high frequency noise, to increase signal-to-background ratio as well as to enhance low intensity components [1], to carry out e.g. Fourier analysis etc.; we have implemented the function for the calculation of the commonly used orthogonal transforms as well as functions for the filtration and enhancement of experimental data.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a build failure log with failing test cases. Testability refers to the ease of validation through testing, including creation of test cases and oracles. The failing tests indicate that the system under test might not be easily testable, suggesting potential issues with test design or implementation.","

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
